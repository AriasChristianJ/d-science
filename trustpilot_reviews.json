They're just freelance web developers teaching beginner stuff and if your resume and your pitch looks good enough they might recruit you with their sponsors otherwise you'll end up with a useless digital piece of paper. If you wanna reconvert to web developer this isn't for you! What I did after Ironhack? McDonald's!",

They behave as they are doing you a favor and the reason is in the line below.\nThe quality of education is low—worth half of what they charge. The reason is that most students don’t pay: their government pays for them (Germany and France), and Spanish and Portuguese students get a deal where they only pay when (or if) they find a job. In conclusion, people don’t pay, so they accept anything they get.\nThe teacher and the management have zero experience in the tech industry. Their first job in tech is teaching… They are all former students. Very weird business format.\nThe career advisors are a joke. Their English is “Berry Bad,” and if they have a partnership with any company—which I doubt—they will, of course, favor the students who will pay them when they get a job.\nBefore I chose Ironhack, I read reviews saying exactly the same things I’m writing now, but I didn’t consider them. That was my biggest mistake. I should have chosen LeWagon, Code Academy, or any other school.\nthe only positive thing was the leading teacher, he was a cool guy but he couldn't do much in such a bad company. The students were also nice too. Anyway if you are thinking of paying their fee you will regret.",

Unfortunately, my experience was utterly disheartening, and I felt compelled to share my concerns.\nBefore even enrolling in the program, I reached out to Mr. Álvarez with genuine enthusiasm and curiosity about the Data Science & AI program. However, his response left me feeling belittled, unheard, and disrespected. His tone was abrasive, and he seemed more interested in pushing me toward a bootcamp than in understanding my aspirations or addressing my questions.\nAs a prospective student, I had high hopes and a deep desire to learn from Ironhack's esteemed program. But Mr. Álvarez's unprofessional demeanor and lack of empathy crushed my excitement and made me question the institution's values.\nGiven this distressing experience, I have decided not to pursue the program further. I hope that Ironhack will take my feedback to heart and work on improving their customer service, admissions process, and overall student experience.\nI would caution prospective students to carefully evaluate their options and consider multiple factors before making a decision.",

You see it was actually my worse weakness when graduating in college. I really can't recall exactly what came onto me to join the AI bootcamp of Ironhack at the beginning, appart from that enormous excitement about what AI was doing to the world and, of course, that personal development I felt I was missing. The fact that I didn't feel like I didn't have an expertise was a daunting thougth. I confess I was so afraid that I wouldn't be able to do it, I doubted myself so much given my brackground, my age, my complete lack of experience in tech. Today, I can safely say that this was the best desicion I made in my entire life. Was it exausting? yes, but it feels like I have solved half of the existencial dreads I had before joining this bootcamp. I don't want to sound too romantic but that is how I am feeling. So really, for those out there that think that is impossible to learn a tech discipline, professionally in 9 weeks, I am the living proof is not, and I got to thank Ironhack for that.

        "review": "I recently finished a UX/UI bootcamp by Ironhack. The only extravagant thing about the bootcamp is the price tag.\nThe bootcamp DOES NOT prepare you for the work of a UX Designer - in fact only after the bootcamp, through tedious self-study I was able to learn basic things such as autolayout in Figma.\nThe career services are an absolute joke - the career week is nothing but a waste of time, and the coaches are not really specialised in their respective fields. It does not help me to have a career coach, who does not know what to look for in a portfolio, or who does not know that Figma-pdfs are not ATS-friendly.\nFor this valuable information I had to turn to ADP-list coaches.\nThinking about the structure of the company it is no wonder. Ironhack primarily seems to hire past students as teaching- and learning assistants. I don't mean experienced UX designers who want to give back, but people who apart from the bootcamp have no experience whatsoever in the field.\nNot only wouldn't I recommend you to attend the bootcamp, I would actively recommend to look for a different one. There are many options on the market, with better structure, better prices, and better networking opportunities. \nI genuinely regret paying for this.",

While they do make it clear that a job is not guaranteed, at the same time they say that most of their students find a job within 3-6 months if you follow their guidance. As an outsider to the tech world, I placed my trust in Ironhack and gave them my hard earned money / little free time.\nUnfortunately, the reality is not what they make it out to be. Out of a class of approx. 20 students, only a few have found a job (and these had previous coding experience). The rest of us are barely getting any interviews whatsoever. All in all, you will pay 7.5k for something you can learn for free on YT and other free platforms. \nThis feels like a legal scam.",

It's been over a quite some time now since I graduated and apparently I was one of the best students ( from what they saying) well let me tell you if u do a reconversion and you over 40yo it is a struggle to get a junior position anywhere! A waste of 8000€, waste of time, I felt bullied and humiliated... they don't teach they read slides! If the teacher and her team don't like you well guess what you pay the hard price! I am very very disappointed... runaway they just want to take your money and they not willing to do any good!

The staff is awful, it takes very long to answer emails and if you communicate an issue to them they are in my experience, extremely condescending. The teacher that led the online course was very unprepared, the lesson consisted mainly of him talking and using slideshows it wasn't interactive at all, and the teacher's English level and technical level was, in my opinion, not adequate enough to teach. The only good thing is that they provide you with exercise martial, but you could access very similar coding exercises through online katas. They don't provide any specific help with careers and I know many of the people that did the Bootcamp had difficulty finding a job, just have a look on Linkedin.",

You'll be amazed to see so many people suddenly finding their way through it and succeeding!\nIn addition, I highly advise future students to manage their personal time outside: sleep, sleep and sleep when you can (and do your flashcards). It will help you greatly when things get harder for you.\nAnd finally, the experience at Le Wagon is also what you decide to make of it. I've met amazing people all the way, even from other batches in Analytics or Data Science.\nGo to all events, all afterworks and create your own events with your batch. \nStaying solo is not a viable option and connecting with as many people you can will make the experience way more worthwhile. \nThanks Le Wagon and good luck to all future students!",

I will continue to tell everyone about my experience here, and what a complete and utter waste of time and money it was. \nHaving actually completed the full time Web Dev course at Le Wagon London in March of 2023 (Jan-March), I can tell you for a fact that it’s not all it might appear from the outside and certainly a number of things are not right. \nLet’s start with the implications and stats - the reason I did this bootcamp was to aid in a career change. They strongly imply that once you’ve done the bootcamp there’s thousands of tech jobs and that you will be highly employable, unfortunately this is just not the case for the vast majority of people who will leave a Le Wagon bootcamp. They use a Stat of 93% employment rate, which as of today seems to have dropped to 90%, yet still I would be amazed if the inverse of this figure was true and that even 10% of students got a tech job because of the bootcamp. \nI am awaiting a FOI request about what data they use to come up with these stats. \nIf these stats were true, surely most of the people I did the bootcamp would be employed. I would say less than 10% of them have a job that isn’t either with Le Wagon or that have nothing to do with competing a coding bootcamp! \nThe content of what is taught and how it’s taught is not good, from focusing on Ruby/Rails, something that’s hardly at the forefront of the tech world in 2023 or at the top of an employers wish list. Then there is the inexperienced staff who have little or no teaching experience and the first time they’ve done anything like this is when they’re offered a job by Le Wagon straight from the bootcamp as what they call a TA (teaching assistant). This is how they’re able to keep their costs down, and how the whole thing is able to keep going, one cohort at a time. \nThe lack of attention to any front end design coding or real emphasis on anything that wasn’t Ruby was astonishing. You question this as you’re there, as do other students and you’re all told the same, that it will all come together in the final week - you’re suspicious but tell yourself they’re a big company, it will be ok…. It won’t. Trust your gut! \nThe ‘career week’ was like the icing on top of a really stale cake, and just an absolute farce. Not only did the 3 employers who were invited not have any jobs to offer, and were not actually recruiting, two of them didn’t seem to know why they were there. When their talks about the tech industry finished, we were instructed to talk to them, like some oddball fans, it was almost like we all gathered round to see what other pearls of wisdom they would offer. They didn’t. \nAll in all, 9 weeks later and not much wiser, I would say they had well and truly done a number on me.\nAlmost two years later, and I am a still not in a tech role, and my physical and mental health has suffered considerably, something which is particularly saddening, given that Le Wagon continues to pedal their bootcamps to anyone who is silly enough to believe their nonsense.",

        "review": "TLDR - Do not recommend Data Engineering bootcamp\nRegion: Europe\nFormat: Part time, fully remote\nPersonal circumstance: full time employee at global Big Tech company\nHaving attended Le Wagon's Data Science bootcamp in 2022, I was very excited when the Data Engineering bootcamp, which was intended for more advanced and experienced engineers, became available. The key reasons why the bootcamp was so woeful can be summarised as follows:\nCons:\n1. The course material was very low quality - 50% of the course was poorly written, contained errors and sometimes did not make sense. Many exercises were open source tutorials that were basically copied and pasted and used as 'course material'\n2. Around 70% of the teachers were unqualified to teach, had no to little work experience and had poor knowledge of the teaching material\n3. Over 50% of my cohort was complete beginners and was not qualified to attend the bootcamp. The bootcamp was advertised as being an 'advanced' course. This was a major impediment to my personal learning as a midlevel, working engineer, as the peer coding and the final project did not work out. This was because some individuals either had no idea what they were doing and/ or behaved very disruptively. To illustrate with some examples, many people did not know how to use github (or understand the importance of version control). Some people could not follow basic instructions or act with simple professional etiquette e.g. interrupting the person speaking during a stand up meeting, attending class in a public cafe and not being able to get their audio working, and asking to meet during work hours impromptu so I could not join (half of my project team members were unemployed)\nPro\n1. The syllabus was comprehensive and well curated. It acted as a good introductory 'map' to the Data Engineering domain\n2. The 3 good teachers were very good, but they were very thinly stretched as the others were ineffective\nI was extremely disappointed with the bootcamp and felt it was not worth the 6000GBP price tag. To be transparent, I left 2 weeks prior to the end of the bootcamp because of work commitments and also my group project was an utter disaster and was not conducive to my learning. A result of this was that I did not get the certificate of completion, which was ok to me because I intended to omit this from my CV/ resume, as I did not want to associate professionally with this poor quality bootcamp.\nI had made several complaints during the bootcamp, but sadly they were not addressed. I had messaged the product manager directly to set up a meeting to discuss my feedback, but this did not materialise. Perhaps a public bad review on trust pilot would prompt from action from Le Wagon\nTo summarise, please avoid and save your hard earned cash",

C'est clairement le seul bon souvenir que je garde de cette expérience. N'y mettez pas les pieds si vous n'avez pas de base ET qu'il vous faut un peu de temps pour assimiler les notions. Certain.e.s ont eu la chance de venir d'un domaine tout autre et d'apprécier. Certain.e.s avaient aussi déjà une connaissance en programmation. Personnellement, c'était loin d'être mon cas et j'en suis sortie plus brisée qu'autre chose (et je ne suis malheureusement pas la seule). \nOn m'a vendu une formation avec un taux de réussite incroyable, mais c'était avant de savoir que la plupart des élèves sortant se mettent en freelance, forcément les statistiques sont biaisées. Mise à part l'apprentissage du Ruby qui est totalement obsolète aujourd'hui, l'expérience acquise n'est pas assez pour espérer entrer dans une entreprise à la suite du Wagon. On nous l'a très clairement exprimé. Quand on demande conseil de quoi faire, vers où aller après la formation, on m'a conseillé une école qui n'était pas du tout dans mes envies ni mes compétences, parce que: partenariat. Heureusement cette formation ne m'a pas servie à rien, mais m'a permis de mieux me vendre pour une rentrée dans une autre école (qui a d'ailleurs été bien démontée de la part d'un.e gérant.e en disant que le Wagon était bien mieux....

En âge de la retraite, mon objectif était de me familiariser avec le métier de data scientist afin de créer une activité dans ce domaine. La formation a non seulement répondu à mes attentes, mais les a souvent dépassées par la qualité et la rigueur du programme. Les instructeurs, ainsi que le personnel, ont grandement contribué à ma réussite grâce à leur présence et leur soutien constants.\nLa formation au Wagon est intense, surtout au début. En deux mois, j'ai acquis une vision généraliste du métier de data scientist, bien que cela ne suffise pas pour devenir expert.\nUn aspect particulièrement enrichissant du bootcamp est la création de liens précieux avec les autres participants et les anciens élèves. Cette communauté représente une opportunité pour le networking et le partage de connaissances.\nEn conclusion, je recommande vivement ce bootcamp à toute personne cherchant à enrichir ses connaissances en data science. Bravo pour la formation, Le Wagon !",

I enjoyed also very much the work with a new budy everyday, it's a great help for learning, you get to know new people more deeply and it creates a good spirit of batch. And of course the teachers and TAs which were very knowledgeable and available for helping with the challenges, taking the time to explain new concepts on 1 to 1 if needed, and they always had an answer, it was really rare to hear them answer ''I don't know\". Finally, I enjoyed the life on campus, always good coffee and good tea available, premises always nice and clean, nice chill areas for lunch time and all the afterwork parties, which were always well organized and good for the team spirit. \nMy experience at Le Wagon has been extremely positive, I enjoyed it even more than expected and I now feel strong and confident in my career transitioning to the data world. I enjoyed going back to school, I enjoyed the intensity of the teaching process, I enjoyed also sharing this bootcamp with very diverse classmates with a high intellectual level and I enjoyed the social side.\nLe Wagon's Paris staff has been really nice and helpful during our bootcamp, we could feel there was enough and competent people to deal with things, and that everything felt really well organized.",

Unfortunately, my experience has been deeply disappointing and frustrating. Here are the key issues I encountered:\nInsufficient Support: The course offers inadequate support for students. Despite my best efforts, the lack of guidance and assistance made it challenging to understand the concepts.\nShort Lecture Duration: The lectures, lasting only 2.5 hours per day, are insufficient to cover complex subjects like SQL, Pandas, Numpy, and others. This limited duration hinders comprehensive learning and practice, making it difficult to keep up with the course material.\nInadequate Interaction: One of the instructors,  instructed students not to ask questions during lectures and to use the chat instead. This approach limited real-time interaction and impeded immediate clarification of doubts, further complicating the learning process.\nLack of Engagement in Breakout Rooms: Students were not engaging in breakout rooms, leaving everyone to struggle individually with challenges. Additionally, inadequate translations from French to English further complicated understanding.\nGeographical Discrepancy: None of the students were based in the UK, with the majority being in Berlin.If I had known the course was not designed for UK students, I would not have enrolled.\nUnsatisfactory Response from Batch Manager: When I raised my concerns on Slack on May 30th, my batch manager advised me to seek information myself rather than relying on support. This response left me feeling unsupported and frustrated.\nComplaints from Other Students: A couple of students also complained about the pace of certain subjects, indicating that my concerns were not isolated.\nThe course does not match what was advertised or what was presented during the interview.

This discrepancy was incredibly disappointing and misleading.\nAnother major drawback was the involvement of Stepex in the funding process. They constantly wanted to look into my bank account, which felt invasive and added unnecessary stress to the experience.\nWhile the tutors were friendly and approachable, the content they taught was insufficient. I quickly realized I needed to learn additional programming languages beyond what was covered in the course to be competitive in the job market.\nIn summary, the course did not live up to its promises or justify the hefty price tag. I would advise potential students to consider other options and be prepared for additional learning and expenses beyond the Bootcamp.",

The format is very intense and sometimes we have the impression that we have not had enough time to assimilate the concepts, but I totally recommended it for those who like a challenge. The two final projects helped me build a lot of confidence around my abilities as a web developer.\nOverall, the experience was great as was the ambiance in the class every day.

        "review": "LE WAGON: A HARROWING EXPERIENCE AND A TRUE NIGHTMARE\nMy journey with Le Wagon has been SO DISAPPOINTING that I feel the OBLIGATION to share my experience to prevent others from falling into the same trap. The SHOCKING news of the CANCELLATION of the bootcamp just five days before its scheduled start, due to only having two participants, marked the beginning of a series of OVERWHELMING problems.\nDuring the registration process, I found myself dealing with MORE THAN SIX INDIVIDUALS, and to make matters worse, I had to REPEAT the application process two or three times. The INEFFICIENCY of their communication system between the branches in Spain and Germany is UNACCEPTABLE and has added an extra layer of FRUSTRATION.\nIn my struggle to obtain the GOVERNMENT VOUCHER, I faced more obstacles. The agent expressed DOUBTS about the RELIABILITY of Le Wagon, which only HEIGHTENED MY CONCERNS. The POSITIVE REVIEWS on their website do not reveal the DARK REALITY of the issues Le Wagon is facing. The LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM is evident, with people DISAPPEARING overnight, supposedly in \"VACATION MODE.\" Additionally, they CHANGED the sales representative repeatedly during my process, causing CONFUSION and DISTRUST.\nTo add INSULT TO INJURY, the Data Analyst course, which costs a STAGGERING 8500 EUROS, left me QUESTIONING ITS VALUE. After READING and CONTACTING former students, it became apparent that completing the course doesn't necessarily leave you as prepared as you might believe. Moreover, the ACTUAL EMPLOYMENT RATE is not accurately reflected on the website, as the INTERVIEWER candidly revealed that many students either LEAVE the course or pursue it for PERSONAL ENRICHMENT rather than seeking employment in the field.\nI made the PAINFUL DECISION not to continue with Le Wagon, losing TIME, MONEY, and even having to CUT SHORT my family vacation to attend this course. In summary, from START TO FINISH, my experience with Le Wagon has been a DISASTER. I cannot RECOMMEND this company to anyone and STRONGLY ADVISE reconsidering any plans to join them. A true NIGHTMARE that I deeply regret having lived through!",

They say everyone can do it but the the data science part it's impossible if you didn't have experience in finance or marketing or business or math.\nAs a newbie you could get knowledge but not enough experience or be confident enough to be hired. But try if you want...\nI won't recommend this school to other students.\nUnemmployed, scammed student and scammed TA unpaid, worked intensely for nothing, that was my nightmare I lived.\nMy class included doctorates, master degree, we all failed the exam. 4/5 students we came back to what we used to do... lol\nI prepared 6 month intensely at home to be selected, then 3 intense month at their local.\nI don't know shy they rent a local, they said they hardly find teachers to be on-site. Some of the students made 1h30 of transport twice a day to come in their local, to see a remote teacher. Some of them were disappointed.\nMy biggest regret is : YOU CAN'T justify the experience we get when we did our challenge exercices during the bootcamp. We can't have an internship or experience in a company to complete the lack of practice. Because having the whole day to underrstand the challenge, then practice, search for missing information or unclear info in their lesson is not enough.\nSometimes we juste gave up on the challenges, because didn't find the solutions of our issue even if the teacher tried to help us, we can't explain by written word on the electronic ticket, so we stayed blocked till the end of the day.\nI was an alumni and then a teacher assistant (not even paid, and i'll explain later in the message).\nI trusted the \"reviews\" online and thought it could help me to change career or find a job easily. \nTheir marketing is good but not their quality, efficiency.\nI had a teacher in-site half of the time. The online teachers were devoted but it has a barrier between the students issue, explain it remotely on an electronic \"ticket\", wait for his availability. \nWhen the teacher is online there is a teacher assistant on-site but they don't choose carefully, just desperate to find nobody and choose an alumni that is available. I had a teacher asistant who just loved to brag, can't explain simply or guide. I was discouraged because you can't ask the real teacher if the teacher assistant is here.\nAs a teacher assistant, they called me  desperate to  year after my bootcamp, I still can't find, I forgot a lot of what I learned. YES there's a lot to learn in a small amount of time, complex notions, challenges you can't do because we were stuck at the 1st exercise.\nThe bootcamp manager said it's easy to be teacher assistant you don't need knowledge you'll have access to all the challenges'solutions (he was an alumni, previously an accountant, but ending here in Le Wagon for administrative tasks)\nI said ok let's try, I wish it will help me. (I was fooled again). They always hire as freelance, promised me \"100€/day\" let me started without any contract but just signed the confidential thing of their courses.\nI saw I couldn't help them a lot because of Kitt issues, or I didn't understand the solutions, or the questions or what kind of the result if expected by the \"make\" tester. When the lost students send a ticket to the remote teacher, the manager told me to help the students. But I couldn't too. I didn't have experience before. They know their bootcamp isn't enough to be efficient to start working.\nSadly a student was discouraged, he said the bootcamp recruiter promised him the teacher will be on-site but that was a lie. He gave up on his good job position and salary to change his career and he want to chooose quality, their organisation is a mess. I reply him I understand, I was lost like him disappointed of the teaching quality at the begining but I'm sure he can succeed if he stay motivated... the discouraged student left on the 3rd day of bootcamp.\nSame time like me, sadly at the the end of the 2nd day of trial my head was all over the place, tried to help the students as much as I can, tired to stay awake until 2am to prepare the exercises, understand the solutions.. I was supposed to work 10am to 17pm the the real rythm every teacher assistant here was 9am (put the zoom to see the remote teacher) to ... at least 12pm or 2am.\nI told them for the next week to find a teacher assistant that can support better, have more experience to share and enrich the courses, share knowledges or tips of an experimented person ! but they just listened. The day after was when the discouraged student I told earlier left.\nDo not be scammed by them please !\nI also left 2 day after because I still didn't have any contract and proof of work, the manager said I won't be paid for the hours I did ! \nExhausted for nothing. I'm surviving.",

And a week or something before the course started (mind you, after I had already signed the contract!!), they told me they could no longer offer me that price.

        "review": "I did the Part-time Data Science online bootcamp from Le Wagon in 2023. \nLet me start with the application process: Everything worked well, they contacted me, I had a quick interview about my prior career and motivation. After that I had to do a little assessment. Nothing complicated. I got accepted and had to pay the fee of about 8.5K Euros. \nThe pre-bootcamp was pretty unnecessary to my eyes as all of that stuff was collected from different free web pages, it was very much but most of the stuff was not needed during the bootcamp as it was covered again or not covered at all. The good thing was you could just check it as done because most of that stuff was not new to me.\nLet's start with the actual bootcamp: The first day was all about getting to know the other participants and preparing the Laptop/PC for the BC. Most of the stuff went through, they had a good and detailed instruction on github, however, some crucial points were missing (e.g. there were some errors occuring while setting up all the environments in the terminal) so one needed to call a TA, which on the first day took like forever...\nThe first weeks were about Python, SQL, webscraping, and data science libraries. Nothing to scary, mostly very easy. So far nothing that was worth 8.5K.\nWhat I was really looking forward to was machine learning and deep learning. The machine learning weeks had good, but sometimes too easy tasks. Most of them \"stolen\" from a popular data-science book by Aurelien Geron which you can buy for about 70 Euros. The lectures were VERY mixed in terms of content quality. Some lecturers were ok, others really TERRIBLE. Sometimes I even skipped the lecture and read the chapter in the book by Geron. \nThe deep-learning weeks covered different architectures of neural nets, however only the most basic ones. Nothing up to date was covered, especially not Transformers, which is a pitty as this architecture is mostly used nowadays. So the deep-learning weeks were ok, but pretty basics. Here one sees, that the creators are not keeping up with trends... Also the creators decide to use TensorFlow library, which, I guess, has didactical reasons. However, nowadays mainly PyTorch is used... Also some of the teachers of the live session were not able to answer questions that went beyond the pre-recorded lecture; I had to research on my own...\nThe last part was about ML-Engineering. Most of the stuff was horrible because of the many difficulties in the tasks and how to solve certain problems so many students had. Also in the 24/7 some questions were not answered at all. Even when I used a ticket with a TA, he could not resolve the problem, also not a second TA...\nThe final project was ok, however two team members almost did nothing or didn't answer any questions.\nFinally and this is most important to my review: The career-week. It was a waste of time. The lectures didn't help at all and the connecting event with companies was a joke. One company was not present at all, the other company not hiring for Data Science, a small start up with 3 members without a businnes-plan, and another company which sounded extremly dubious. \nI wished they would worked together with companies throughout the whole bootcamp maybe already presenting problems from them, which you try to solve so that they can find potentially interesting people. The way Le Wagon is doing didn't work for me.\nI regret doing the bootcamp. You should better go for a university degree if you want to get a job in that related field (Data Science, Data Analytics, ML Engineer...)",

Cela nous a permis d'éviter de nous perdre dans la théorie sur un sujet aussi complexe. Les formateurs étaient tout simplement exceptionnels, d'autant plus qu'ils étaient d'anciens élèves du Wagon. Leur expérience pratique dans le domaine a été d'une grande valeur pour nous, les étudiants.\nDe plus, leur disponibilité était remarquable. Ils étaient prêts à aider, même en dehors des horaires de cours. J'ai appris énormément en peu de temps, et les exemples fournis étaient si concrets qu'ils seront facilement réutilisables dans le futur.\nCependant, dans le contexte actuel, je dois souligner que trouver du travail peut être un défi, même avec de solides compétences en Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, et JS. Cela peut être dû à des facteurs indépendants de la qualité de la formation. En fin de compte, je recommande toujours cette plateforme pour l'apprentissage, et les formateurs étaient vraiment chouettes, d'autant plus qu'ils étaient d'anciens élèves du Wagon, ce qui a ajouté une touche unique à l'ensemble de l'expérience.",

I come from an artistic background and was not easy for me to take the decision to quit my job and learn to code @lewagon but it was surely the best decision to do !  Le wagon is an amazing school, all the staff is amazing, in a start-up spirit, with buddies to learn not alone but with someone to support you, you won't believe how many things you can learn in 9 weeks ! The first weeks, you won't be sure you will be able to code at the end, but keep learning and believing and you will see the result ! You will feel more powerful, and from my experience, I feel so much better, knowing that I started my year with new skills ! Go !",

I strongly recommend Le Wagon!🚂❤️",

The program was well-structured and taught by experts in the field who provided us with a comprehensive education in data science.\nWhat I loved most about the Data Science bootcamp was the emphasis on hands-on learning. Throughout the program, we worked on real-world data sets and projects, allowing us to apply our skills and knowledge to solve meaningful problems. The instructors were incredibly knowledgeable and always available to provide guidance and support.\nThe curriculum covered everything from data cleaning and analysis to machine learning and data visualization, and the instructors did a great job of breaking down complex topics into easily digestible concepts.\nThe bootcamp was also incredibly well-organized, with weekly events and networking opportunities that allowed us to connect with other students and industry professionals. This was a great way to build a network in the field and get insights into the industry.\nOverall, I would highly recommend the Le Wagon Data Science bootcamp program in Cologne to anyone looking to break into the field or further their education in data science. The program was well-designed, and the instructors were knowledgeable, supportive, and passionate about the subject matter. I feel confident in my ability to apply the skills I learned in my career, and I am grateful for the experience.",

We were able to develop and deploy two websites within the program, including a clone of Airbnb and a financial management tool called My Invest. Working in a team allowed us to learn valuable collaboration skills and provided us with experience in a practical setting.\nThe teachers and bootcamp manager were exceptional. They were patient, knowledgeable, and always available to help us with any questions or issues we encountered. Their guidance and support were crucial in making the bootcamp a success for me.\nOverall, I cannot recommend Le Wagon Nice enough. The program provided me with the skills and knowledge I needed to succeed in the field of Full Stack Development, and the experience was truly amazing. If you are looking for a career change or want to enhance your skills in web development, I highly recommend Le Wagon Full Stack Developer bootcamp.

The staff were really friendly and inclusive, really making everyone in my large batch (50 of us!) feel comfortable whilst also pushing us to get as much as we could out of the learning environment. By choosing Ruby and Rails, the course is very focussed around full-stack so bear that in mind - all concepts are fundamentals to get a job as a frontend or backend engineer.

J’ai décidé de m’y inscrire tout en étant assez angoissé à l’idée de retourner dans un milieu scolaire que j’avais auparavant fui. Cette angoisse s’est rapidement dissipée en découvrant comment se déroulait le bootcamp.\nDes cours bref et concis le matin, des exercices ludiques à faire à deux ou plus tout le reste de la journée, aidés par le professeur et des professeurs assistants (anciens élèves du bootcamp), le tout dans une ambiance familiale et un lieu qui ne l’est pas moins, sans oublier les évènements et soirées organisées par le staff : tout est pensé pour favoriser un apprentissage en douceur, malgré l’intensité du travail à fournir. Pendant les 9 semaines du bootcamp, j’ai pu apprendre énormément de choses et faire plein de rencontres intéressantes. Je suis fier de pouvoir dire que je suis maintenant développeur fullstack en freelance et je suis ravi d’avoir choisi de tenter l’aventure du Wagon.\nJ’ai même tellement apprécié que j’y travaille aujourd’hui régulièrement avec plaisir en tant que professeur.\nMerci Le Wagon 🥳",

Fragen wurden zeitnah beantwortet, und es gab immer Unterstützung, wenn man sie brauchte. Die Kombination aus praxisnahen Beispielen und individuellem Coaching hat dazu beigetragen, dass ich mein Wissen effektiv vertiefen konnte.\nWas mich besonders überzeugt hat, ist die klare Ausrichtung auf die Bedürfnisse der Arbeitswelt. Der Fokus auf den Erwerb von realen, anwendbaren Fähigkeiten ist in meinen Augen ein unschätzbarer Vorteil für den eigenen beruflichen Werdegang. StackFuel GmbH hat sich wirklich darauf konzentriert, die Brücke zwischen Theorie und Praxis zu schlagen.\nIch kann StackFuel GmbH jedem empfehlen, der in den Bereichen Data Science oder Business Analytics tiefere Kenntnisse erlangen möchte.

        "review": "1. Hauptanteil der Weiterbildung besteht leider Gottes aus (interaktiven) Texten, also ähnlich wie „lernen mit Büchern“. Dabei wird jeder Schritt einzeln abgefragt („Tue dies, jetzt tue das“) Selbständigkeit wird dadurch nicht gefördert. Texte beinhalten neben unzähligen Grammatik- und Rechtschreibfehlern (könnte man in meinen Augen noch drüber hinwegsehen) leider auch inhaltliche Fehler, was leider auch in mind. einem Quiz vorkam. In meinen Augen ist das bei einer professionellen Weiterbildung, die in meinem Fall einen fünfstelligen Betrag kostete, ein absolutes No Go!\n2. Die sogenannten „Lösungsvideos“, die auch existierten, aber erst freigeschaltet wurden, wenn sich erfolgreich durch die Texte gequält wurde, lasen lediglich die Lösung – also den Code, der benutzt wurde – vor. Eine Erklärung warum jener Weg gegangen wurde, fehlte leider gänzlich. Für jede Person mit tüchtig funktionierenden Augen war das unterirdisch und sinnfrei. (Kurzes fiktives Beispiel: a^2+b^2=c^2 würde im Video folgendermaßen „erklärt“ werden: „Und das Quadrat von a addieren wir zu dem Quadrat von b und erhalten c-Quadrat.“ Nein, doch, oh!) Zudem war der Ton häufig soo leise, dass ich meine Kopfhörer nicht immer nutzen konnte.\n3. Das Arbeitspensum (zumindest im Data Scientist-Kurs) war trotz eines erheblichen Vorwissens out of space. Das schnelle und stupide Abarbeiten der Aufgaben wurde dadurch weiter begünstigt und die Selbständigkeit, Dinge wirklich eigenständig zu durchdringen, leider weiter gehemmt. Wie frustrierend der Kurs für Teilnehmer ohne Vorkenntnisse im Bereich von Machine und Deep Learning gewesen sein muss, kann man hier nur erahnen.\n4. Die eigene Broschüren der verschiedenen Kurse legt die „Selbständigkeit“ der Teilnehmer in den Fokus, verkauft das Unternehmen als „strategischen Lernpartner“ und die Lernumgebung als „aktuelle Technologie auf neuestem Stand“.\nUnterstützung der Selbständigkeit – nicht gegeben, im Gegenteil sie wurde, wie oben an verschiedenen Stellen beschrieben, häufig genug gehemmt.\nStrategischer Lernpartner, welcher bei gestellten Fragen mit drei immer wiederkehrenden Antworten reagiert: „Hast du schon gegoogelt“, „Hast du schon ChatGPT gefragt“ und „Das weiß ich nicht, ich werde einen Kollegen fragen und komme wieder auf dich zu“ (Person kam nicht wieder auf mich zu. Auch nicht, als ich die gleiche Frage eine Woche später erneut stellte und mir erneut die gleiche Antwort gegeben wurde xd) – Daher ist in meinen Augen die Aussage, StackFuel sei ein strategischer Lernpartner safe auch nicht gegeben.\nAktuelle Technologie – Vorweg: Es werden nicht die aktuellsten Versionen der Machine Learning Bibliotheken, wie zum Beispiel sklearn, benutzt. Ich hätte Verständnis, wenn statt der aktuellsten Version, zumindest eine Version benutzt wird, in der wichtige Erneuerungen berücksichtigt sind. Die benutzte Version von scikitlearn war 0.23.2 (zum Vergleich Version 1.3.1 war zur damaligen Zeit die aktuelle Version; Es gab also fünf neuere Versionen, als jene, die uns zur Verfügung gestellt wurde). Durch die ältere Version konnten viele Funktionen nicht benutzt werden und work-arounds waren künstlich notwendig, um die entsprechende Lösung zu erhalten. Besonders dann, wenn man mit „aktueller Tech. & neustem Stand wirbt“, empfand ich diese Tatsache als dreist. Mindestens genauso dreist fand ich aber auch die Bereitstellung von lediglich 4 GB Arbeitsspeicher. Data Science lebt von Rechen- und Speicherleistung. Wie man in einem Kurs, indem es um rechenintensive Verfahren geht, nur 4 GB anbieten kann, deckt sich mit meinem Eindruck, dass es bei dem Unternehmen hauptsächlich um Gewinnmaximierung geht, koste es, was es wolle.\n5. Die wesentliche Mehrheit der Mentoren war leider selbst Quereinsteiger und konnte einem hin und wieder echt nur leidtun. Je nach Hintergrundwissen unterschieden sich die Mentoren extrem in ihren Antworten, in der Führung und im Aufbau des Kurses und in ihrem Engagement. Leider wurde mein Wunsch, wenigstens einmal in der Woche (gern auch in der Gruppe) aktiv (live coding) gezeigt zu bekommen, wie best practise im jeweiligen Kapitel auszusehen hat, ohne Nennung von Gründen abgelehnt.\n6. Jeden Freitag hat die Nachmittagsbetreuung im DS-Kurs ohne Nennung von Gründen nicht stattgefunden – und das bei so einem Preis, nein Spaß, wir wollten nicht mehr über den Preis sprechen… xd\nZusammenfassend: Ganz schlimme Erfahrung im Bereich des E-Learnings. Großer Verdacht, dass auf Grund von AZAV-Zertifizierung eine Art Goldgrube gefunden wurde - denn wo kein Kläger, da kein Richter...",

Es wird alles in Schriftform erläutert. Die wenigen Videos sind absolut oberflächlich und eigentlich nichtssagend. Ich kann zwar gern das Forum kontaktieren, aber das hat genau so einen geringen Lernfaktor wie der Kurs selbst. Ich kann einmal an einem Workshop teilnehmen, der an einem Tag in der Woche ist und nur zu einer Uhrzeit. Ihr könnt euch vorstellen, dass man nachmittags leider kaum Zeit dafür hat. \nIch habe bis jetzt kaum die Zusammenhänge verstanden. Es ist gefühlt wild zusammen geschmissen und trocken erklärt. Geht eine weitere Aufgabe von der vorherigen in eine andere Richtung, kann man das \"Erlernte\" nicht mehr anwenden. Man zahlt einen haufen Geld für den Kurs, dass man letztlich wieder bei Google landet. \nIch kann meinem Arbeitgeber sagen, dass er viel Geld ausgegeben hat und ich der Weiterbildung leider nichts anfangen kann. Schade drum, ich hätte gerne diverse Daten ausgewertet und damit Abläufe verbessert. Aber mit dem Wissen was ich jetzt erhalten habe, traue ich mich nicht an größere Datensätze. \nSehr schade ist es zudem, dass man im Endeffekt nichts in der Hand hat. Keine Zusammenfassung mit deutlichen Erklärungen etc. \nSpeichert man sich nicht irgendetwas ab, ist es nach dem Kurs verloren. \nFazit: Nicht zu empfehlen! Ohne eine richtige Schulung (wenigstens per Video) ist der Kurs leider sinnlos.",

Die Weiterbildung ist für mich bestimmt kein Selbstläufer gewesen und ich habe viel Zeit und Energie reingesteckt, bin jetzt aber sehr, sehr happy mit dem Ergebnis und dem Wissen, dass ich mir aneignen konnte. Ich kann die Weiterbildung jedem empfehlen, der seine Datenkompetenz ausbauen möchte und ein solides Fundament im Bereich Datenanalyse aufbauen möchte.",

Folgende Punkte haben mich dazu gebracht diese Bewertung zu schreiben:\n1. Es gibt kaum Videoinhalte, und die Lerninhalte bestehen größtenteils aus trockenem Text. Man kann zwar Code-Snippets eintragen und diese werden ausgefürt, aber es findet keine Validierung auf Richtigkeit statt. Und wenn man weiterliest (egal ob man was eingegeben hat oder nicht), wird man so oder so gratuliert (\"Congratulations! You've learned xyz\"). Das alles wirkt m.m.n. einfach minderwertig und nicht würdig für so einen teuren Kurs.\n2. Wenn man nicht an den wöchentlichen Online-Meetings teilnehmen kann, besteht die Option Fragen im Forum zu stellen - und diese werden auch schnell beantwortet. Allerdings sind die Foren so gut wie leer! Es gibt so gut wie keine Fragen von anderen Teilnehmern von denen man profitieren könnte.\n3.  Man verliert den Zugriff auf die Inhalte nach Ende des Kurses. Dies war mir zwar von Anfang an klar sodass (anders als bei Punkt 1 und 2) hier keine Enttäuschung entstanden ist. Jedoch sind die Gründe dafür nicht ganz nachvollziehbar für mich, denn man hat dafür ja schließlich bezahlt. Wenn es an den begrenzten Kapazitäten der Cloud-Umgebung liegt, kann man das zB mit einem PDF-Handout und einem lokalen IDE lösen. Klar, man könnte in der Theorie eigenständig Screenshots machen aber das ist nicht der Sinn der Sache.\nIch schreibe so gut wie nie Bewertungen im Internet, aber der Kurs hat mich leider so dermaßen enttäuscht dass ich ich mich schließlich dazu entschieden habe, meine Frust öffentlich zu machen. Bin wenigstens froh dass ich keine ~5000€ aus eigener Tasche gezahlt habe. Es gibt genug Ressourcen im Internet die wesentlich, wesentlich günstiger und hochwertiger sind.",

Im Laufe des Kurses arbeitet man lediglich Übungen ab, entwickelt aber keine eigenen Konzepte oder erhält Anregungen wie man dabei am besten vorgeht. Als Projekt wird dann erwartet, dass das experimentiert bis es funktioniert, was an sich legitim ist, wenn es dabei ebenfalls Feedback geben würde. Während man mit eigenen Modellen experimentiert, so kann es immer mal wieder vorkommen, dass man einer Merkwürdigen Error-Massage über den Weg läuft oder unvermittelt in einen Time out der Umgebung läuft. An sich wäre das auch kein Problem, wenn es individuelle Projektbesprechungen geben würde oder wirkliche Hilfe durch den Support während der Projektphase. \nWendet man sich an den Support so erhält man nur den Hinweis, dass Hilfestellungen nicht mehr erlaubt sind [-1]. Was umso absurder ist, da man auch im Verlauf des Kurses immer wieder darauf hingewiesen wird bei Problemen den Support oder das Internet zu nutzen. Ebenfalls unglücklich ist, dass man keine „Auflösung“ des Projektes erhalten würde, wenn man das Projekt nicht zufriedenstellend abliefert. Den Teilnehmenden wird also die Möglichkeit vorenthalten die eigenen Denk-/Konzeptionsfehler nachvollziehen zu können [-1]. Dieser Ansatz ist nicht nur pädagogisch höchst fraglich, sondern auch höchst unseriös. \nAls persönlich Fazit würde ich daher weden den Intensiv-Kurs (DA & DS) noch den DS-Kurs einem Anfänger empfehlen, der diesen Kurs nebenberuflich absolvieren will. Auf Grund fehlender Betreuungsangebote es leider Schade um das Geld.\nWer den Intensiv-Kurs über einen Bildungsgutschein absolviert mag hier besser aufgehoben sein. Allerdings würde ich auch hier Anfänger raten erst den DA-Kurs als Einzelveranstaltung zu absolvieren und sich zunächst an eigenen kleinen DS-Projekten zu versuchen und nicht direkt den Intensiv- oder DS-Kurs zu belegen.\nDatensätze dazu gibt es zB bei \"Kaggle\" und Lehr/Orientierungsmaterial unter \"machinelearningmastery\". \nStellt man dann fest, dass man strukturierteres Lehrmaterial braucht, so mag der DS Kurs eine akzeptable Erweiterung sein.",

It’s actually challenging in a good way — it pushes you to think, apply what you learn, and complete real projects.\nI got stuck on 2 or 3 tasks and even felt frustrated at times. But I managed to push through, and that gave me more confidence. It’s definitely not impossible to understand, but you have to be self-disciplined and motivated.\nRight now, I’m in the middle of the course, so I’m still not 100% sure if it will be worth it in the end.

I specifically chose this program for its flexible, self-paced structure, which lets me learn on my own schedule while staying on track with weekly assignments. The dashboard design breaks the material into small, manageable sections, helping me stay motivated without feeling overwhelmed. The hands-on projects are a great way to apply what you’re learning, and if you put yourself out there, you can build a student community for extra support.\nThat said, one area where I think CareerFoundry could improve is in offering more personal interaction with tutors. While weekly video calls with mentors are helpful, tutors—who are more directly involved with your assignments—are only reachable via written feedback or chat messages. Having occasional video or phone calls with tutors could really enhance the learning experience and clarify feedback more effectively.\nOverall, it’s a well-structured program best suited for motivated, independent learners who appreciate flexibility but would benefit from a bit more real-time interaction.",

By the end of the program, I had multiple polished case studies that showcased different types of analysis, from consumer behavior insights to predictive modeling. Which I now use to demonstrate my skills to potential employers.\nThe support from mentors and tutors made a big difference. Their feedback was thoughtful and helped me grow not just technically, but in how I communicate insights effectively.

One of my requirements for online learning was to have the option to listen to the material rather than read it.  I was assured that the module had an audio option.  I began taking the intro courses, which had a screen reader integrated, all good.  But once I was out of the intro course and into the immersion part, this option was no longer present.  So I had to slog through using an extension to my browser for audio, which I thought was deceptive.\nMy other issue involves the tools required to complete the program.  There were a few tools that were offered as free to use during the course, but along the way there were a lot of tools required that you needed to use on a trial basis and then needed to be paid for to continue. The trial length was short, so I had to sign up with multiple emails to accomplish my assignments. This seems like a deceitful practice.  When you are paying for a course, you should have access to all the tools you need included in the tuition cost. CF should be partnering with these vendors for limited use of the tools \nFinally, many of the links to articles in the lessons were outdated or behind a paywall.  I feel like this was indeed a waste of money.  I got what I needed from the course and then lost interest.  To that point, not one person reached out to me about my lack of engagement. I think if these wrongs were corrected, this could be a much better program",

Following the program, I sought feedback from an experienced design professional, only to discover that my portfolio was considered below industry standards—even though it had been approved by CareerFoundry mentors.\nI also participated in their 6-month job guarantee program, but unfortunately, I still did not secure any interviews. When I requested a refund, I was informed that I was ineligible due to a lack of “proper documentation” and because I had not met with my mentor every two weeks. This was challenging to accomplish, as my mentor had personal issues that led to canceled calls, and my full-time job made rescheduling difficult. I was also told that I needed to check in with my mentor biweekly, but he would regularly not respond to me, or get back to me days later so what was the point of checking in this often. \nReflecting on the program, I feel that CareerFoundry’s job guarantee and strict policies seem designed to attract students rather than prepare them for success and realities in the design field. About two-thirds of the way through, I started noticing a lack of detailed instruction on essential design topics like accessibility, spacing, color, and typography. While these topics were mentioned in assignments, they were often too vague to apply effectively. I gained far more insight through my own research and guidance from industry professionals than from the program itself, leaving me feeling misled.\nWhen I requested a phone call to discuss the refund, I was told CareerFoundry didn’t have enough staff for a conversation—a surprising response from a company centered on UX, where user insights should be a priority. \nAt this point, I am genuinely disappointed with my experience in this program. To anyone considering CareerFoundry’s UX program, I would advise looking elsewhere.",

The program is laid out by the technical skills you'll need in the field when you pass the course.  You also are assigned a tutor and mentor.  These are the three blocks in your foundation to becoming a Data Analyst.  When I was researching programs, the fact that this program assigned you real people to help you through a virtual course really made the difference for me.  Both my tutor and mentor are a great support system during my endeavor to learn this new skill.  As with anything, there are challenges; my experience has been positive so far with the entire program - my mentor and tutor and the student support services.  I started the program in February this year and plan to complete the program in January 2025.",

Having said that, there are few areas that could use improvement. \n1. I have made a couple of friends on Slack from the course but I do wish it were easier to find people at the same stage/level in the course to study with. I work well in study groups and haven’t been successful in finding people to study with yet.\n2. The workshops don’t seem live. I have attended a couple of the workshops and they don’t seem live to me. I could be wrong, but I would love it if all the workshops weren’t just recordings.\n3. Having an audio lecture would be super helpful! There is a feature where students can listen to the readings but it’s with a dry, robotic voice and it’s hard to stay engaged. Having an actual lecture would be great. They have a few video recordings throughout the course but it’s usually only for small sections. Having something similar to these but for the entire Exercise would be really helpful to someone like me who is used to a lecture.\nAll in all, it’s a nice course with extremely positive mentors and tutors.",

I'm learning a lot (which is what I wanted) but much of this is on my own...online study buddies can be hard to find, the tutor can take up to 24 hrs to get back to you (so if you have a couple of questions throughout a Task, it can take days to finish a 3 hr assignment) This course is def teaching me to think outside the box for problems, which is good, but some days it feels harder than it should be.",

During the course one gets super professional and helpful instructors, diverse projects and lots, lots of insights that you will never get by self learning. Beautiful portfolio & executive career advisory are the cherry 🍒 on pie. Thank you, Career Foundry!

The best part about the program is the flexibility as I can read and work on tasks at my own pace, so I squeeze in some studying whenever I have some time. The only thing that doesn't quite play out as smoothly is trying to find someone for help when I'm confused about a task or stuck on a project. There's no \"immediate\" answers and I cannot just \"raise my hand\" and ask a question, but that is usually the case with online learning. There's a tutor and mentor, but the responses usually take some time, and the responses are sometimes not what I expected or hoped for (not too detailed or doesn't really address my question), and I can't afford more time going back and forth and waiting. I usually end up figuring out things by myself one way or another, but the process can be very frustrating at times.",

The Mentor was the only one who actually helped me when I had questions but because I could only meet with them and hour a week I could only really get though one assignment a week. \nI even paid for two \"extensions\" to give myself more time with the Tutors and Mentor.

The structure it provides gives my self learning a very supportive backbone and direction.  Most invaluable though, is the access to a mentor.  I find that I can write down questions throughout the week, from my learning, and they are sooooo friendly about it.

You never get your money back. I am very disappointed after the program when I realized how little value the certification has on the job market and among employers. The company has a fantastic Marketing team, but that's it. Don't believe everything they post on their website and blogs. It's just not true. The value is zero after graduation. Nobody cares about the projects built and you won't find a job, not even for under 20k€ a year. The course itself was okay, but the investment stands in no relation to the job market and present situation out there. Many fresh devs have no other choice than to take a voluntary internship (if somebody hires you).  You will by 99% don't get a job, your applications will be mainly ignored, if you don't have a computer science degree and a few years of relevant work experience as a developer yet. Mentor and tutor support is also very poor, although after three changes my third mentor was superb. I was just lucky. Otherwise you will probably get stuck in the course at some point as it gets difficult for at least 1,5 years if no longer. It's impossible to finish the course as a career changer without support from the assiged tutor in 3-6 month. For those who have already completed an acedemic degree in the field of IT with 1-2 years of relevant work experience, yes, it's gonna be a terrific course to sharpen your skills and specialize in. Otherwise, please keep your fingers away. 9000€ for the bootcamp is too pricy, rather invest in a university degree or consider another choice, if there's no time management issue. Don't believe stories like a taxi driver can make it in 3-9 month to a highly in demand Frontend or Fullstack Developer. It's not true.",

What I love the most is that I get so much motivation and inspiration from the fact that I am changing my life and career with every I exercise I submit. It makes me want to move on and do more and more to reach my goal in the end of the program (to find a job, of course ;). I love the stuff I'm learning and I can see how every thing I learn can be applicable in the real life. I am always looking forward to the next exercise, as after each of them I feel like I become more clever and cool. I was very surprised to learn that I am actually not so bad at math and statistics, as the exercises are created in such a way that I quickly understand what to do and how to apply it. However, it's not all about numbers, I am happy I can be creative with DA as well. I am also happy with my tutor and mentor. They are always there to help, respond quickly, and my tutor even gives me additional material to each exercise. \nOverall, I am more than happy and grateful to myself that I made a decision to start the program with CareerFoundry! I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to change their career or boost their knowledge in DA. \nPros\n- Very friendly and super professional tutor and mentor. Very supportive, reply very fast and give valuable advice (and additional material). They also always encourage me and help me fight my imposter syndrome :-)\n - Detailed, creative, logically structured exercises, saturated with valuable information. \n- Amazing tasks! - Supportive student advisors, always ready to help. \n- Price-quality ratio is adequate. Other schools that I looked at offered shorter programs for a higher price.\n - Interesting cases and stories in exercises (especially in the section about visualisations). \nCons\n- Sometimes there are small mistakes or inconsistencies which I always try to report to the Quality Assurance team. They sometimes disrupt my understanding and the workflow, and I have to ask my tutor for help, who usually agrees with me about the mistakes I find. It takes time to get a confirmation from my tutor, so I lose time. \n- Some sources are a bit outdated, although I understand that good sources have no expiration date.",

The courses are text-based instruction with links to articles online. Each article has an assignment with a very low bar to passing - essentially just following instructions. I got limited feedback throughout the course, maybe about a sentence of feedback and a list of more links to articles on the topic. My tutor approved almost everything after the first try, and it was only sent back to me once because I forgot to include a component. \nAfter finishing the course, there's a career course that you need to complete in 1 month and start applying for jobs to qualify for the job guarantee. The course had something like 12 assignments, one of which was to create a website with all the case studies for the course. It took me about a month just to build my portfolio website. The course does not teach how to build a website so I had to watch youtube videos.  I finished the course in 2 months and thus was ineligible for the job guarantee. \nAfter I graduated, their advice for getting a job didn't work for me. I applied for jobs, networked in the field, and did a few volunteer projects to build up my portfolio. I went through about 4 career specialists because they kept switching me when the suggestions they gave were not working. The career specialists I worked with seemed frustrated with me and often behaved as if they did not believe I was doing the things I said I was doing. For example, one asked me to track my time and activities on the job search. I spent an extra hour or so each week doing this. When I submitted my results and asked for a meeting, I got a more detailed prompt for tracking my job search. When I submitted my more detailed report of what I did in the past few weeks, I was told to keep doing that every week.",

        "review": "At the beginning it started out ok and I was completing the coursework on time however, I soon noticed that if I had a question or came to a point where the content was not clear or there was information missing, I couldn't get help right away.\nAll I could do was send a message to the tutor and have to wait 24hrs for a response. The question could have been as simple as a yes/no response but I had to wait 24hrs just for that response. This immediately struck me as something disturbing and I began questioning the efficacy of this training. There were also many times when the course content was not clear; I had questions about what the exercise was trying to tell us but had to wait 24 hrs just to clarify what they were talking about.\nSomehow I got over these hurdles and kept pushing forward. About half way through the program, my tutor took some vacation for about 6 weeks. CA assigned a replacement tutor that, for the most part, didn't really care or spend the time with the student to help them get questions answered.\nI lost 6 weeks with the replacement tutor and could not finish an exercise that I had all but completed but I needed his assistance on a persistent error message I was getting.\nAfter 6 weeks I was still on this same exercise and right around that time my tutor finally returned and found the problem within 24 hrs (of course I had to wait 24 hrs) but the point being that this showed the difference in the tutorial assistance I was receiving. Why couldn't the substitute tutor have found the solution in 24 hrs? It was either because he himself didn't have the knowledge to debug the program or he simply didn't care to spend the time with the student.\nNext problem was with the mentor (different from the tutor I was talking about) for a certain exercise he was assigned to. Once again I reached the end of the exercise and had a connection error that I was unfamiliar with. I submitted my work with all the coding involved and he [the mentor] told me he couldn’t render it locally on his machine and asked me to get it working on my end before submitting it to him again.\nI thought; Excuse me but what is the mentor’s purpose here? Why am I paying so much money for this assistance and he only tells me to go figure out by myself? I had finished the exercise but I was getting an error that could have been debugged if he spent the extra few minutes to find it.\nSo the mentor then went away on vacation for a week (more time lost in the program) and I turned to my tutor who had been very helpful all along. He responded within 24hrs to tell me the project was working on his end. He had no problem with it. It was working just fine. So I asked him if he could help me find out why it wasn’t working on my end. It must have been some setting or something that I was missing and he agreed to help me find it. He spent a few days on it but we still hadn’t come to a solution.\nI had to be considerate of his time as well as this exercise was not even assigned to him originally so he was spending extra time to help me out aside from his regular work schedule. By that time however, the mentor had returned so I turned the question back to him and explained to him that my tutor was able to get it to render locally on his end and once again if he could help me find the reason it wasn’t rendering on my end. His response was the following:\n\"I would suggest have a call with him and share your screen and show him the issue you are having and see if he can help fix the issue since you said it is working for him. I am kind of busy to spend time on this to figure out what is the issue.\"\nOnce again I thought, are you sure you’re a mentor for this program? I’m paying for this assistance and your answer is to go to someone else for help?\nWell, that was pretty much the last straw in this program and just about all I could handle with the long delays and wasted time. I could have finished the entire program by now if I only had the proper assistance that I was paying for. I cancelled the program but they would not refund anything as compensation for the time and money lost due to their inefficient program.\nThey have a 15 day money-back guarantee which is a joke. You would never find these problems in 15 days. You would have to experience the program and realize the inefficencies and problems later as time went on and you go further into the course materials.\nI only hope that this review can help others to make a proper decision when looking for on-line training programs such as these BEFORE spending their hard earned money on it.\nI would not recommend this program for all of the above reasons.\nCourse content is confusing; assistance takes too long plus inability or unwillingness to help out students in a timely fashion and sometimes not at all. The Career Foundry program gets a 2 on a scale of 1-10. That’s my rating for this program.",

They also advertised that they have great tutors and mentor who support you throughout the program....I had 5 differrnt tutors and 3 mentors due to the absolute lack of support from previous ones, and some of them being rude and insulting when you ask for help. This program talks the talk with how supportive and amazing it is, but absolutely does not walk the walk. And the fact that their projects are YEARS out of date is ridiculous.

It seems highly improbable that so many members of the general public would have coincidentally written good reviews on the same day, especially when no positive reviews have been published for such a long time. Just saying...\nThe course is VERY outdated. There are long pieces of text to read (sadly hardly any video's - come on Careerfoundry - it's 2022!) The long, rambling texts have been translated poorly and incomprehensibly from German. Good luck if you are an English speaker.\nThe allocated times for tasks are ridiculous. To give an indication, they say certain tasks will take 6 hours - they will in fact will take 35 hours minimum.\nIt's a two year course condensed poorly into 9 months. When inevitably you don't finish in time, you get charged a monthly fee for going over the allocated time. It's a complete money making enterprise. Be prepared to shell out a lot more money than the initial course fee.\nThere are much, much better and far cheaper courses out there. \nI have started two other courses (I'm not sure if `i can mention the names on trustpilot) but both courses were a fraction of the price and I have already learnt more more in 2 months than I did in 12 months of Careerfoundry. \nSave yourself some money and some pain and avoid.

Starting with the articles in the blog, when you're in the wondering phase of what to do and which way to go; to tutor and mentor, who are very helpful and motivating; to curriculum, which is written in very friendly and comprehensible language; to the vast community from all over the world; to own paced studying; to the Job guarantee option, where if you don't find a job in 6 months after the end of the course they will refund you the money. What else you would need?",

I would highly recommend this course as it has a job guarantee and a career specialist which other bootcamps don't have.",

I studied five months prior, but I had no structure and low confidence levels when I taught. \nIt would be tough to pull this off, especially with no help or direction in my portfolio. I think CareerFoundry has an excellent structure for self-paced learners who thrive on being self-accountable and dependable. Because you are in an online cohort and not in person, it is super important to build that relationship with your tutor/tutors. I had Bryce and Vijit, and they always give good feedback and send links to relevant material. Besides that, my mentor Oz is very personable and has a remarkable ability to break down problems or questions for me, and his video feedback is priceless. \nLastly, I have just recently started working with my Career Specialist Cheron, and she is excellent and has an insightful view on why I want to pursue specific opportunities. I would say you get what you put into the program.",

Seine Aufgabe wäre es, Studenten mental auf das Berufsleben vorzubereiten, er demotivierte, machte mich klein und zeigte mir lediglich, dass ich nicht gut bin in dem was ich tue, das tat er aber sehr ausdauernd. Er ist selbst erst 5 Monate in dem Beruf tätig und ist seit dem Abschluss bei CF eben mentor dort.\nDer Karrierespezialist, auch keine Erfahrung in der Branche, gab sich große Mühe aber wusste auch nicht wirklich, worüber wir reden sollten oder wo er mich hinführen sollte. Er war auch nicht motiviert, sich mal von sich aus bei mir zu melden, einfach mal fragen wie es mir geht nach 20, 30, 50, 70 Absagen.... generell gibt CF IMMER dem Studenten die Schuld. Es liegt am Lebenslauf, am portfolio, an der Motivation, an den Farben, der Ästhetik, der Zahl der Bewerbungen, Kritikfähigkeit, Formulierungen, Nase, whatever, Schuld ist der Student. Wenn er keinen job kriegt, macht er was falsch. \nCF vermittelt auch keine Jobs, die haben keine Kontakte in die Industrie. Null. \nDer Abschluss ist in der Industrie nicht sonderlich anerkannt, \"so ne Maßnahme vom Amt halt\"... \nDa macht es keinen Unterschied, da kann sich der absolvent auf den Kopf stellen, einen job kriegt er jedenfalls nicht.

Although the program is primarily online, it truly excels at fostering connections with fellow students, tutors, mentors, and the supportive school staff.\nThe weekly class meetings with our dedicated teacher are an excellent feature—they're not only well-organized but also backed by opportunities for one-to-one sessions and communication through chat or email. This personal touch ensures students feel heard and supported throughout their learning journey.\nAdding to this, the school hosts weekly webinars featuring tutors, alumni, entrepreneurs, and even the occasional recruiter. These sessions offer invaluable insights and inspiration from industry experts. Furthermore, while practical sessions on Agile principles are not part of the curriculum (there is a section in the learning material, though), there’s a fantastic alternative—monthly Hackathons. These are skillfully organized with teams comprising students and alumni of various skill levels, providing a brilliant opportunity to put Agile methodologies into practice. I recently participated in my first Hackathon, and I’m still buzzing with excitement from the experience!\nOne of the standout features is the careers team. They go above and beyond to coach students on perfecting worksearch essentials such as LinkedIn profiles and portfolios, while also offering personalized advice to help us stand out in the job market.\nThe learning interface is both comprehensive and challenging, striking the perfect balance to keep students engaged and motivated. In addition to the above, the school boasts a wide array of other enriching features that would take pages to list—but trust me when I say they enhance the experience remarkably.\nIn conclusion, Code Institute of Dublin offers an outstanding and immersive learning environment, even in an online setting. I wholeheartedly recommend this program to anyone looking to dive into software development.",

While the program was high-intensity, for me personally it was also really enjoyable, keeping me engaged and constantly learning. The structured curriculum on the LMS platform and expert guidance form our cohort facilitator, our bootcamp coding coaches and our subject matter experts made a real impact on my growth. \nNot only that, a standout feature is their Slack community and the sheer variety of information channels they offer, which makes remote learning feel truly interactive and engaging. Being part of a vibrant, contributing network of students (past and present) and staff has been amazing for learning, collaboration, and support throughout my journey.\n Yes, it’s hard (it’s a lot of information to process in a short timespan), and it’s not for everyone, but if you’re like me and you thrive on challenging and really pushing yourself to  go further in your understanding, and don’t let challenges stop you, then this course could be for you. \nOne of the standout aspects is the monthly hackathons, which provide an amazing opportunity to refine skills, build confidence, make valuable connections and apply what you’ve learned in a fun (and competitive!) way. Winning first place in the April 2025 Unmask the Coder: Beating Impostor Syndrome One Line at a Time hackathon with my team was a huge highlight for me! It was certainly an apt theme for my first true hackathon and with one being held each month hopefully it won’t be my last! \nBeyond the technical training however, Code Institute also offers career support and guidance, including 1:1 sessions, an LMS Careers course tailored to job readiness, webinars featuring insights from past alumni and major tech employers, and also hold an insightful annual Elevate careers fair that is a wealth of information and tips for a anyone wanting a career in tech.\nThese resources have been invaluable in preparing me for the job market and building connections in the industry. \nOverall, I highly recommend Code Institute to anyone looking to gain hands-on experience in software development. The support, learning environment, and continuous skill-building opportunities make it an exceptional choice for anyone passionate about growing in this field! It’s not surprising that they received an Outstanding rating from Ofsted this year!",

Even with the slowest plan you have 12 months and the hours/week they say you’ll need that should be at least doubled if not tripled.. Too much information and definitely not enough time to understand and keep up as a complete beginner. There was no such thing as career advice afterwards. Once exams were done i never heard of them again except for a phone call i received more than a year after completing the course asking me if i found a job in the field. Well i didn’t. And after paying all that money they cut your access to the learning material once the last exam is submitted. I did learn a lot but overall this was a huge disappointment.. Many things are being promised and those promises are not kept. I don’t think it’s worth the money and i definitely don’t think that things that are not going to happen should be promised..",

We covered everything from HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Agile Project Management, DBMS, JavaScript, Python Django and Git...everything you need to build a full-stack web app. The course material provided enough foundation for us to explore further and self-learn after the course. The course included two individual projects and two hackathons, which were challenging but we learnt so much through them.\nThe tutors were incredibly helpful, and went above and beyond to ensure all of us got a good grounding in the diverse range of topics. We were in a cohort of about twenty students, and we got to know each other and supported each other through the daily standups and groupwork. We continue to support each other through job-search and exploring other learning beyond the course.\nCode Institute also provides incredible support after the course through the careers support, 1-2-1 coaching, recruiter webinars, etc. The Careers Hub was a source of great tips for setting up my CV and LinkedIn, effective job search and interview skills.\nThe CI community includes all students from the various courses across the UK and Europe. I have just taken part in the monthly cross-community hackathon, where students can meet other coders at various stages of their course and alumni who can share their expertise and experience. We had a tough brief but it was great fun learning new things.

It felt like having a guardian angel during tough times. Additionally, a tutor support team is available throughout the day to help with any bugs or problems students may encounter.\nThe Slack community also tirelessly organizes events, webinars, and video calls to prepare students for the tech industry. Top recruiters host live sessions, and there is a dedicated careers team that works closely with students to help them secure their first tech role, offering one-on-one support.\nWhat mattered most to me was that I never felt alone during my coding journey.

It is quite hard to find friendly hackathons in the general public on platforms like Devpost\n- project-orientated approach was good\n- supportive slack community with regular online events \n- the general culture is positive, professional and inclusive. Special shout out to the community engagement leads for being available to answer Questions and support students\n- tutor support team were ever so helpful, I did my homework before approaching them and I could rely on tutors to help me along with junior-level bugs and get over the finish line\n- this kind of part time/ remote/ 12 months is a far more effective approach to career changing than 12 week bootcamps. \n- the course regularly listen to student's feedback and do their best to adapt\nareas to improve:\n-  I have finished this course with more reservations about the overall value of follow-along video tutorials.  I found them helpful in moderation, especially at the beginning, but by the time I reached project 5 specialisation advanced frontend module it felt overkill and could have done without 70% of it in the grand scheme of things - by this point I knew how to set up a project and use Node Package Manager. This is quite a difficult balance to get right to be fair, as all learners are different. For context, CI do not make video tutorials compulsory and provide alot of support for meeting project deadlines on time.\n- considering AWS is the largest share of cloud services worldwide it would be nice to include more of their free tier. The curriculum I took did not include AWS.\n- I would have traded project mentoring for more career support mentoring sessions personally. For context CI offer 1 halfway through the course and I believe there is support for when you secure an interview.\nI still maintain a positive relationship with this course and look forward to attending more hackathons!\nI aim to update this review once I have landed my first full-time job in the Tech industry.",

My experience with this program was one of the biggest disappointments of my life. The course is outdated, the support is terrible, and the diploma is useless when it comes to finding a job.\nOutdated Material That Causes More Problems Than It Solves\nThe course material is years old, using outdated technologies and versions that no longer work with current models. This leads to endless issues where code doesn’t function as expected, and I was left confused, wasting hours trying to figure out problems caused by obsolete lessons. Instead of updating their content, Code Institute continues to sell a broken program that sets students up for failure.\nLittle to No Real Support\nWhen I encountered issues (which was often due to the outdated content), I turned to tutoring sessions for help—only to be met with rude and unhelpful tutors. Some of them couldn’t even fix the problems themselves, wasting my entire session before telling me to wait another week for new tutoring hours to reset. How is a beginner supposed to solve problems if even the tutors don’t have answers?\nMentorship was no better. My mentor’s advice? Compare my code to his old project from three years ago, even though our projects had nothing in common. When he still couldn’t figure out why my code wasn’t working, I was forced to delete everything and start over, with no explanation of what went wrong.\nA Rigged Assessment Process That Forces You to Pay More\nThe way Code Institute runs its assessments feels intentionally designed to make students fail so they have to pay for resets also if you don’t agree with the results well to bad because you can’t contest it. They market themselves as a job-ready coding bootcamp, but the reality is that the course doesn’t prepare you for real-world work at all. When I finished, I realized that I still didn’t have the skills needed to land a job.\nCode Institute Cares About Money, Not Students\nThis company is profit-driven, not education-focused. They prioritize making money over actually helping students succeed. I wouldn’t trust them as my experience was nothing as it was advertised to me. \nFinal Verdict: Don’t Fall for the Hype\nIf you value your time, money, and mental health, avoid Code Institute at all costs. There are much better learning options out there with fairer assessments, better support, and up-to-date material. This program was a massive waste of money, and I strongly advise others to look elsewhere.",

Something unique and interesting about the Code Institute is the possibility to participate in hackathons and meet new people in the projects you have to work on for 5 days and practice working in a group with tools like Github or using Agile. The possibility of doing a specialisation is something that I really enjoyed because it allowed me to develop my final project in an area in which I wanted to develop my skills more and go deeper in this area.",

Video based learning but the videos are very basic and lack most information. Also, student support are useless and can take days to get back to you so if you are on a tight timescale with a project and need assistance you are basically doomed. Your mentors aren’t allowed to mentor you, only guide. They can’t tell you how to do things so you can’t actually get any help from a human being. You have to google anything you need help with. I regret forking out the 7.5k for this course along with some of my fellow students who all feel the same way. It’s fine if you live in Ireland and can do the course for free but DO NOT pay for it. I spent £30 on a course focused on css and learnt much more in those 4 days then I did after 3 months learning through Code Institute.",

Not just the 5 day course that others have mentioned. \nI managed to get on the course for free as a job seeker, and I'm glad I did as if I had paid for it I would have been very disappointed. \nThe HTML and CSS modules were a really good, comprehensive and easy to understand teaching method. So when I first started it had high hopes that I would do really well on the course. However, when JavaScript was introduced it was a different story. I found it quite difficult to learn and for some reason the way they taught it differed greatly from the HTML and CSS sections. \nThe videos and questions were a bit all over the place. There were times when they would tell you to go and look at a previous chapter to remind yourself, but the resources weren't there. Then they would crop up again later on in later chapters. It was like they took a year long course and shaved it down to a 16 week course. \nOnce you got your head around the basics of JavaScript you were thrust head long into Python. Likewise again the teaching was really poor and frustrating. I think we ended up doing 2 weeks on python, and then onto Django for our final project. \nI understand that there is limited time, but I feel it just wasn't enough time to learn even the basics of what was required. \nVery little support from the mentors. My mentor was very likeable, but I felt she lacked knowledge and we were often told she would \"look into it\" and never got back to you. You were constantly told to go and use outside free resources for answers to questions. This is my issue with the course. You can find everything the course offers on the internet for free. In my case watching YouTube was more enlightening than anything the tutors taught us. The sessions with the experts were watching them make something, which was not only boring but didn't teach us anything. \nThere were some very good bits, however. The careers advice was pretty good, and for someone like me who has very little experience applying for jobs this was a really good part of the course. I now feel more confident in the jobs market, even if I have decided that the tech world is not my calling. \nComing out of the course it became pretty clear that the tech jobs are none existent in my area of the country, and a lot were based in London and Newcastle (I don't live near either). \nI also would have preferred it if the careers advice was a bit more generic, as a lot was about how to get a tech job, something I am clearly not going to get. \nOverall I'm pleased I completed it, but I didn't learn anything I couldn't have probably accessed for free ether on the internet or in the community. \nPlease save your money, and if you are offered a place for free then take it, but don't expect miracles and 3 months later I am still unemployed, but at least I've had a few interview where I've been close to securing a job.",

This organization is focused on making money rather than genuinely supporting students.\nTheir assessment process is designed to ensure you fail, forcing you to pay for resets at every opportunity. You are given a maximum of three attempts per project, and each reset requires an additional payment. With five projects in total, you could end up paying for up to 15 resets if they keep failing you for minor issues.\nEven if you follow the mentors' instructions perfectly—documenting your code, providing screenshots, and conducting thorough manual and automated testing—they will still fail you. I personally had a project that worked perfectly, was documented with all the necessary evidence, and passed initial criteria. Yet, they failed it after claiming a functionality issue that clearly didn’t exist at the time of submission. They completely ignore their own teachings, leaving you powerless to defend your work.\nThis company thrives on taking advantage of students’ time, effort, and money. Their assessors are disconnected from what the mentors teach, and they refuse to take responsibility for issues that arise outside your control, such as code-breaking during the long wait for assessment results.\nIf you value your time, money, and mental health, avoid this program. There are far better options out there with fairer assessment processes and actual student support.",

Also, in some instances, I needed to find alternative explanations for some of what we had done, or why some code wasn't working, as the videos by themselves were not enough (ChatGPT can be a useful tool for code debugging).

Honestly, if I could afford it at the moment, I would do the full course at the Code Institute without any hesitation. They seem to be professional, businesslike and to the point.

Its accessible, free, and doesn't require too much of your time, and can be completed however you see fit within the timespan of a week. \nHowever, I didn't feel that the course appropriately accomodated its target audience. I was lucky to have some background in the use of HTML and very very minimal CSS knowledge, which carried me through days 1-3. Other people were not so lucky. I saw many people getting immediately confused with the content and going to the Slack group for help, where they were assisted by someone who didn't even work for Code Institute. Several people mentioned using YouTube to find the answers as they felt this wasn't adequately explained through the Code Institute's videos. \nWhen I asked a query about the programme, it took the better part of a day for me to get a response. If this was the response time for queries regarding the actual code, then I can't say that seems very helpful, especially when you are on a rather strict timeframe of finishing everything in a week. I'm not sure how many queries were being sent, or how many members of staff there were to deal with this, but I think its clear that response time from CI's end was not great. This, coupled with videos which had typos in them and weak voiceover in some areas, made me feel that I was better off just using the written instructions which accompanied the tasks, and that's actually how I did days 4-5. \nThis is not to say that I think the concept of the course is bad, and I do have positive things to say about some parts. The programme they use to tell you whether your exercises have been completed correctly was incredibly useful, and I really enjoyed the process of running my code, seeing the output, and adjusting to make something better. The idea of building up a functional website over the days was also interesting, though I felt this would have been better if the code which it carried over was yours, instead of their own code again. I just feel like the course needs a lot of TLC. I understand that, as a free course, this is probably low on the list of priorities for Code Institute. However, I will say my experience on this course would probably put me off pursuing the larger, paid-for course that CI run. \nI have heard that the course is being evaluated, and so I hope that the information I've provided in this review gives some direction as to what needs to be changed. There is such strong potential for this course to be an entry point for new coders, but right now, it just fails to be that stepping stone.",

In the end, there is almost nothing more than the content and being able to use the community on Slack (which IMHO is not worth thousands of Euros).\nIf you decide to enroll, I would advise you to stick to the tutorials as much as possible when creating the projects. Change one or two things to have a pass, and create an awesome README for merit. If you would like to probably have distinction (because the criteria are not clear) try coming up with something new but simple, and write an extremely clean code.\nIf you need a diploma, Code Institute is a good option. But if not, I would recommend buying Udemy courses (which are not more than €18… never pay the higher amount, there are discount codes all over the internet, just Google it). There is no other advantage; at least the Udemy courses are usually updated as soon as there is a new version of the frameworks (speaking about the Django, Javascript, and React courses I needed to buy to complete the course). If you have doubts, most of the courses give you access to a Discord server where, sometimes, even the creator of the course answers questions, no matter if they are part of the content or not.\nNOTES:\n1. It seems like CI is going through a change in almost everything. But, my experience was not good. I hope they manage to sort everything out, which is a lot.\n2. Student Care and the facilitators (at least the one I had) are extremely supportive, but the internal politics seem to have them hands-tied in helping you have a better learning experience.",

Or that was the case for me, at least. It's a shame they decided to overdo the Javascript component: simply using it to affect the font on mouse over/off would have made it much more manageable. Still, overall an excellent little course to give you an insight into what kind of aptitude you might have for packages involved, and really fun to complete!",

Although the layout and tech was great, the content wasn't so much and that's because the lessons didn't cover the end-of-day tests. Day 1 was easy-peasy - the lesson was appropriate and the test tested you on what you'd learnt. Day 2 not so much: the test at the end of that day wasn't covered in the lesson and so you were encouraged to do a Google search with the narrative that \"even the most experienced coders will have to use Google to solve a problem, from time to time!\" But two points on that: Day 2 of an absolute beginners course is NOT an appropriate level to be expected to Google the answers, it should be covered in the lessons! And I didn't sign up for an aptitude test, I signed up to learn a bit of coding. I managed to pass the first couple of tests at the end of Day 2 with a lot of playing around to see what worked, but it was a time-wasting exercise because it should simply have been covered in the day's lesson! I saw a few comments in the Slack channel as well from people who were struggling simply because what we were being tested on hadn't been taught. I also commented the same and got a private message from someone asking me if I'd figured it out because he hadn't managed to. I became demotivated about the course after that because this messing around was not what I'd signed up for. Am I still interested in coding? Yes! But a course that teaches THE BASICS rather than testing your aptitude to Google it. I'd give it 5 stars for the tech, but 1 for the content, hence the generous 3 stars. Not my style of \"teaching\" I'm afraid. I don't recommend it.",

In most college courses you pass a project /coursework you get some points..here it will be as if you didn't go anything at all. Don't recommend.

However, it's worth noting that the course can be quite demanding at times, leading to a bit of stress.

Other thing what she told me is because I did not complete the challenge 100% anyway my appointment and application would be not considered, I did send multiple proofs about I did complete every single step and even I got my certificate but she didn’t believe me (is like calling the customer lier) and told me on the last message “We can agree or disagree but your application is and will be removed.” Now that I call 0 respect to customer, if they behave like this imagine after you finish the program. I’m not gonna lie if this conversation would go smoothly and she behave otherwise then my review most probably change or would be deleted. Don’t look only on the good parts in bootcamps check them behaviour to because that would give the impression how they will help you to get everything what you need. It will be a miracle if this review be removed and will make sure share my thoughts everywhere and provide proof.\nAfter passing my 5-day challenge, I was booked for a call meeting. However, no one called me on the day I had booked a slot. Afterward, I sent them a message on Facebook and email but received no answer at all.

It just quickly shows you how to do it. The details are said very quickly. I felt like I should have learned more about coding before taking it. I felt like I didn't belong it was frustrating. I felt like I had to learn how to learn how to use your coding class. I used my my phone to to Google about half of what I was supposed to be learning in this course. The how to do is confusing. You give guides on where to put things and how to do it, but it's confusing. Once again I had to learn how to figure what out what you wanted. Once I figured out how to understand the way you you try to explain things it was easier, but it was really frustrating to have to do that. You add some stuff for us already, which you would think would help but it interrupts the process of how we just learned how to do it step by step. If this is for people who know computers it's probably easy. I thought it was for someone who had no experience. I did learn  some and I feel much better about starting to learn to code. But I quit like 5 times and now that I've learned more about this field I look back and say wow that should have been much easier than it was. And the mistakes I made were just little, but it was because the quick video was just not actually teaching or really explaining. I've learned twice as much, and at a faster speed from a book I'm reading. If you are trying to get people to be apart of your code academy I would work on this five day challenge. Real teachers teach.  Bad teachers say read pages 5-10 and I'll quiz you tomorrow. That's not teaching, but it's how this felt and that's not a good first impression. I never right reviews but I just started to try to learn coding and I almost gave up because of this five day challenge. I'm sure computer savy people will see this as easy and feel smart, but someone like myself with no experience it just felt frustrating. I'm sure your actually institute isn't like this but it's not a good first impression. I hope this helps you because I almost gave up coding before I started out of frustration from this course.\n \nAfter receiving feed back. I guess I should have contacted code institute before giving a review. I didn't ask for help so I don't know how that would have gone. I did finish the course and I did learn about html. So try it out and make sure you ask for help before judging like I did.",

I can say with confidence that the Code Institute provides the best support from tutors, mentors and Slack where you will find support, help to cope with stress, anxiety, or just talk to someone.

It’s been tough, particularly considering I had to keep my full time job at the same time (which I did almost until the very end) but hey I landed a new tech support role a few days after finishing so some might say it was all worth it!!🚀🥳The code institute course is very intense, a lot is covered in a very short time so in my experience and with my background it has been at times overwhelming. The topics are simplified when presented so you’ll have to do a lot of research and study on your own to fully understand. The tutors system works well, they give you a mentor and I was lucky with mine. The slack community is pretty responsive too. I didn’t feel I was part of a team or a class but if you consider you can study whenever you like or have time I suppose that’s the price to pay. If you’re interested in coding and are willing to put real effort into this life-changing opportunity: jump. It’s scary, I know. But what if it works? 🍀🚀",

Sure you learn alot on the course and some things are really good like the standups each week to discuss and troubleshoot with the group about code issues for the current submission projects.\nBut some of the course video material is very outdated and not easy to follow for a beginner. I would say you should have some prior knowledge of coding or someone back home to ask about coding issues or this course will be to much. Half the time you spend trying to fix the issues of outdated versions that no longer exist or has changed. The javascript learning material which is the hardest to learn is a dissaster with all teoretical reading of concepts. I learned more by watching youtube code videos than following the course videos. The assessment of the submission projects is also extremely strict and unforgiving meaning that if you have missed on only one thing you will get a fail regardless of what it is, which I find very unmodern and estranged from the world. Your projects must also follow the design of each walkthrough project or you risk not getting any help. But with all that negative out of the way its still an introduction to start coding, get support and start leaning how to teach yourself new skills and languages. But its not as easy as they advertise it.",

But ofcourse, in real life, you also google 20x per hour for some solutions. So, it was really interesting to do, and what would be nice, would be more different projects, so you can choose which project you want to do. And sometimes i wrote a word like \"onion\" with \"Onion\" and it didnt accept that. or maybe it wasn't onion but it was any coding word and i had to write it the same like the solution wanted it as requirements, so i had the programm running perfectly, but one word was written with a big letter at beginning and that wasn't accepted, what took me some time to understand the problem :D \nin the end, it was interesting to do, i got some exp. in that from that, if i want to do this, and i want to do this, and in the end, at the phone call, after i completed the 5 day coding challenge, the person was also very nice and helpful, and funny :D HAHA\nbecause he always said like a robot, like he has to say that, \"yes  marin, you are totally right\" or something loike that :D xD \nbut it was fun :D \nthanks alot! i will continue with this course, and hopefully i can be one day, a real software developer junior /assistant . \nSee ya",

Challenge’s Difficulty: For beginners, the challenge seemed too basic, lacking depth and complexity needed to truly engage or challenge.\n2. Relevance of Tasks: The tasks felt outdated for 2023. Web design and development have evolved far beyond the concepts presented in the challenge, making it seem somewhat disconnected from current industry trends.\n3. Lecture Format: Pre-recorded lectures significantly underperform compared to live webinars. While live sessions might be less convenient for some, they offer richer, real-time learning experiences. The inclusion of recorded sessions for those unable to attend live could be a balanced approach.\n4. Outdated Content: The material, evidently not updated for over a year, misses the mark in delivering fresh, up-to-date insights crucial for tech learning.\n5. Overall Impression for Prospective Students: The experience over these five days shapes one’s perception of the entire Code Institute’s curriculum. Live interaction and a more current syllabus would likely leave a more favorable impression.\n6. Expectations from Code Institute: I’m hopeful and confident that Code Institute’s full program is far more relevant and in-depth than what this challenge portrayed. However, the experience of these five days should better reflect the quality and modernity of the institute’s offering.",

Also you guys should use colour coding fonts in the written steps to also to match to where it goes in the coding elements, this cl could assist people learning coding easier by with colour association for certain code functions or actions. Maybe not such a bad thing peeps are not told language is American standard, trying to spot syntax errors is not a bad thing though I think spell checking the code is probably standard these days. You should have a group assignment as well to get people involved with each other to talk earlier on otherwise peeps be thinking I'm just talking to bots here :) I'd be having the coding assistant online and reaching out to the different region and telling the joiners the supporting coders hours off availability and lunch time on their profile where it can be seen very clearly. You'd probably be better off giving people a time schedule i.e we start at 9:30 am take X amount for break and finish at 5:00 pm or start at 8:30 am finishing at 4:30 pm. Whatever you guys feel would suit. You should also have Oauth and API integration for W3 school (GitHub etc.) and a few other helpful online tools so peeps know where to find them and what they do. So an Introduction to online tools to help in coding challenge will also benefit peeps! Have people from different locations across a shared timezone join the group along with one other from same country for group challenge if possible (maybe automation with bots can help with that).

You are taken through each stage, before taking the challenge and end of lesson test.\nWatching and following up the lessons help to solidify your learning.

And watch out with the reviews 9 out of 10 reviews are for the 5 day coding challange not for the course itself. 12 hours a week is a lie! (Talked with other students all said the same).

Kursen är alldeles för svår för nybörjare, dålig undervisning och nästan ingen hjälp alls. Sedan påstår de att 90% av eleverna får jobb direkt. Vilket är skitsnack. Flera studenter blir klara men får inte ens tekniskt supports tjänster. Eller ens blir kallade till intervju. För mig har den här resan handlat om att överleva hårda deadline och mycket förväntningar för en kurs som bara kostar pengar. Om man missar deadline då får man betala böter på 150€. Och om man inte klarar av godkänt så får man betala en avgift på 50€ !!! Kursen är så svårt och jag skulle inte rekommendera det för någon. När man betalar närmare 70 000 kronor är det svårt att bara hoppa av! Gå en ordentlig svensk utbildning är mitt råd till alla som funderar på att lära sig programmering. Det finns ingen som blir programmerare på 40 veckor med tanke på hur mycket det är att lära sig och ta in. Jag ser framemot att avsluta kursen och gå vidare med livet utan Code institute!!",

I’m not from a tech background so I was not expecting this to get me a job but the certificate is a nice incentive albeit rather useless. \nThe only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was for these reasons. \n1. The speaker rushes through the video in a monotonous way. I had to pause the video and read the transcript because it was as if he was speaking one long gigantic sentence instead of bullet points or paragraphs. 2. I understood most of the 5 day tasks eventually but it took a lot of rewatching or asking a friend who pointed out that the guidelines for passing the module were more strict than reality. ( spaces when there didn’t need to be one etc). \n3. The second day was massively more difficult than the others. I don’t know why but it felt as if the other people in the chat forum were also experiencing the same. \n4. The tasks were not really clear all the time. Especially day 2 and day 5 I didn’t really know what I was supposed to do and it took hours to figure it out. \n5. The speaker could have explained on the alternative routes to practice. ( using notepad and saving as .html, using Firefox under developer mode [f12] ) so that we could use debugging.",

I found the website to be quite accessible overall. The challenges were well-structured, easy to follow, and made a lot of sense. The instructional videos were also well-explained, and I found it relatively easy to follow along. However, I did come across some accessibility issues that I believe need to be addressed, especially considering that this is a company focused on software development.\nWhile the buttons for running and testing the code were visible to my screen reader, I encountered difficulty in locating the button to reset the entire code. This is a crucial functionality that needs to be made accessible immediately. To work around this issue, I resorted to copying all the code into a notepad file so that I had access to the original code.\nAdditionally, when watching the videos, I found the transcriptions to be quite good. However, it would have been helpful to have a transcript of the code as well. Currently, the code is only displayed on the screen, which makes it a bit challenging to follow along, especially for individuals who are not familiar with coding and are using a screen reader. Fortunately, I already possess coding knowledge, so I was able to understand the content of the videos. But for someone without coding experience and relying on a screen reader, this could prove to be very difficult.\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend the 5-day coding challenge offered by Code Institute. However, I must mention that I am giving it a rating of 3 out of 5 due to the aforementioned accessibility issues. While these issues may seem minor or insignificant, it is essential for me to highlight the importance of prioritizing accessibility in all companies, including those involved in software development.",

The best way for humans to learn is to set targets. In x days you will know how to do this & state why that is important, link to real world business needs if needs be. That sort of thing. But using the coding tools, Slack, GitHub etc is very reflective of core tools used by most companies these days. Keep it as practical as possible. IT to me is no different a skill to learn in terms of experience as any Stem role, we learning from doing i.e. mechanics, electricians,  builders, etc. The course material & backend infrastructure and the lack of meeting people face to face would need to be addressed. You would also need to have Government buy in etc. Security, privacy etc. Lots to consider. Very interesting process though!",

Quite good infos and description on html css came up, but - in the last chapter - really brief js overview was demonstrated, choosing a not really life-like example, unfortunately giving us a copy paste solution - instead of testing our real js knowledge & teaching syntax. \nIMHO, This type of tests are rather hooks for naive people leading them into the expensive courses.\nFinally, a blank diploma was \"printed\" to me as \"certificate\". It means that the name field was {is} empty.\nSince the online edu pages were also filled with GUI problems, I think the whole thing could_be {I don't know: but could be} a suspicious try.\nI'm not satisfied with the quality nor the method nor the attitude.",

They sent several emails, but nothing \"spammy\", just bona fide info on how to access the course, additional learning resources via their YouTube tutorials, and invitations to contact them with any questions.\nThe course is delivered through pre-recorded video messages, and they also hosted a community discussion group on Slack. It was led and monitored by a Code Institute rep. \nThe videos were great, they include a written version of everything said on the video - very important for me as a visual learner, and also helpful to quickly find and review one detail of the lesson material without having to click through the whole vid. Also makes things very accessible for those whose first language is not English, or people with auditory issues. The presenter speaks with an Irish accent, so if you're not used to that the transcript can be helpful.\nA little spoiler alert - the second day is a pretty steep learning curve so don't get discouraged if you feel out of your depth. I got through it by taking extra time to work on it, reviewing the video carefully and making notes, and by using the Slack chat. That was crucial to success - there are tons of other people doing the challenge, and people are often sharing helpful tips or screen shares showing how they approached it. \nIt was a really well produced, well moderated, and well run intro to HTML and CSS with a splash of JavaScript. I am an absolute beginner and hadn't even heard of CSS before taking the course. I felt the 5 Day Coding Challenge was a great introduction to coding, and a very useful tool for testing the waters to see if I would like to get into it as a career.",

All the brakes that he was taking while speaking between each word very making the course very hard to follow.",

        "review": "I am recent graduate of Code Institute, having checked Trustpilot a year ago for reviews, and thought now that, as I took the leap of faith and graduated, that I'd write what I'd consider a fair review. Obviously, this comes from my personal experience.\nI will start this off by saying that if you are looking to start this course believing that you will be magically granted a job right at the end, then I would say this is the completely wrong reason to study software development. Code Institute do have some fantastic resources and contacts to get you closer into the job market, and you can definitely lean on them for guidance, however no institution can guarantee you a job.\nHaving said that, a vast many alumni, graduating from Code Institute, get a job within 6-8 months. I have even seen as much as 2 months. A minority gain jobs while on the course however this is a bit more rare and probably more luck-induced or they have contacts. \nFocusing on the course itself and material: I loved it. As someone who was mingling in and out of coding with Python beforehand and had no idea of what \"roadmap\" to take, Code Institute supplied that. I learnt the following: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, Flask, Django Framework, React.js and Django REST Framework. GitHub Pages and Heroku were used (during my experience) to host live projects. Your 5th project is a specialisation project and you can pick between E-Commerce, Advanced Front-End and Data Science.\nNow, it's very easy to say \"you can just learn any of these on your own or for much less\". Well of course you can. You can learn anything on your own rather than join an academic institution. Before doing this I was an avid polyglot and I could learn French on my own without the need for higher education. However some people go to university or do courses. It's no biggie. What Code Institute does offer, contrary to doing it by one's self, is guidance, structure, mentor and tutor support, a community (I have networked with hundreds of more people than I could've expected au debut) and career support. There are even hackathons, which are carried out by a voluntary group and has been growing in popularity. The experience from this has been one of the best aspects of the course. I grew close to my mentor, whom I consider an absolute gem, and even had another mentor for my final specialisation project, and who was also brilliant. This sort of support has been instrumental in my confidence-building and insight into the tech industry. To top this off, the diploma at the end of the scheme is university-rated, which makes it a meaningful document if you wish to take this to higher level studies. \nCode Institute do offer a payment plan too, you can pick between several. Some people have managed it via a grant or other ways. Personally, the payment plan was perfect, tight at times but it was very doable. Whether they will continue to offer this in future time after this review, obviously I am unsure but I don't see why not.\nYou do this course as fast or slow as you like. If you already know HTML and CSS, great, speed through the sections to work up on what you know, get to know your mentor and get working on your first project. You'll have saved yourself some good time for the much harder projects which are to come. The greatest thing about this course is that I could continue to work my rather awkward job with awkward and often unpredictable hours and complete the course material. For me that was primordially important and a rare opportunity in my life. \nSo overall, thank you Code Institute for everything :- ) I am especially pleased with my experience.",

        "review": "I recently took a coding course with Code Institute, and unfortunately, I feel like they fell short on their promises. After submitting a complaint and planning a call with the team, I wanted to send a letter explaining my concerns regarding the areas of support that were sold to me but not delivered, ultimately hindering my learning.\nMy complaint initially had three main points: tutor support time allocation and the consequences of exceeding 45 minutes, video call availability, and guaranteed check-ins every four weeks, as per the CI material.\nAlthough I wish the calculation of time used was based on the entire course rather than weekly usage, I am content with the explanation provided regarding how tutor support time is allocated, as it is fair and transparent - especially after receiving recent emails to students. Therefore, I am willing to move on from the first point without any further issues.\nInitially, I had trouble receiving support from tutors with coding issues related to the course, which led me to wonder why I wasn't offered any video support. I spoke with other students, including some alumni, and none of them had ever been offered video support.\nOn February 28th, 2022, I received a response from CI stating that \"Due to capacity reasons, the tutors are not currently offering screen shares, so video support is unavailable for now.\" However, from my understanding (and what was sold to me), video support was a key feature in the support package sold by CI. When I asked for confirmation on when video support was stopped, I was advised on March 2nd, 2022, that \"My colleagues have advised that this was discontinued about 6 weeks ago.\" Later, on March 11th, 2022, I received an update that \"Just following up on this, my colleagues have confirmed that the recent break from video calls is a temporary measure, and they're due to be reintroduced in the next month. They've also noted that these calls are not by request, but are provided where a tutor feels the situation requires due to particularly difficult coding errors that the tutor needs a better look at to help the student overcome the problem.\" I would like to understand the criteria used to define a particularly difficult coding error, as I consider spending over 4 ½ hours on a coding issue at minimum to be a difficult coding error, and I cannot understand why video support would not be offered. From my research and experience, I find it hard to believe that any video support has been offered since I became a customer of CI. No one from the community can confirm receiving video support, and I've had multiple 4-hour+ tickets with multiple tutors without any offer of video support. This was a key selling point when I decided to purchase CI, and I feel misled.\nRegarding the third component - guaranteed check-ins every four weeks, as per the CI material - it was confirmed that I didn't receive a call for 14 weeks. In an email sent by CI on March 30th, 2022, it was stated that \"I can see you didn't receive a call-based check-in due to changes to the team during the 14 weeks between August 30th, 2021, and December 6th, 2021.\" However, in response, it was said that \"During that time, 6 emails, covering a variety of topics to keep you engaged and reiterating how to access your supports, were sent along to help keep you on track.\" I checked to see if I missed.\nFollowing the completion of PP2 the support was not delivered. The 14 weeks were still paid for in full and so far there has not been an answer to why the support sold has not been delivered. In total the course is £6,500 over 12 months. 14 weeks of that is equal to £1,750. Failure to deliver what was sold to me has cost me over £2,000 in either direct losses or consequences from failure of the delivery. \nThe reason I chose Code Institute over any other provider was the support package sold to me. When deciding on who to go with, CI led heavily on the strong support from having tutoring (1:1 support) including video calls, instant messages and emails, the assigned mentors and slack channel. Unfortunately this hasn’t been delivered, I’m dissatisfied that what was sold to me has not been delivered.",

Less about JS.\nDay 1 to day 4, HTML and CSS, were good.\nHowever, I think day 5 was my least favourite. \nI had hoped to see something about the layout in CSS.\n I would have arranged the content differently over the days, so that they could also see this. \nIt would have been nice if we could display different lay-outs with media queries across different screen sizes. \nIn addition, please spend a little more time on JS, because I think you went over that just a little too quickly and explained less well than the previous days.\nThe JS section was just a copy and paste excercicese. So, not a real challenge.\nIn my opinion, with layout in CSS and JS you discover more if writing code is something for you.\nIt didn't even bother me that copyright 2023 gave error message. (in the video (c) 2018, in the exercise (c) 2022). But when you update these videos, remember my tips!\nTogether with tips and tricks from experienced coders and a behind the scene from code institute students how followed the courses in the past, would be nice. Because your courses aren't not high recommended on the internet. Not because the are very expensive, with hidden costs and and with the same problems as the 5 day code challenge.\nMaybe you should make the code challenge a week long, the video's are prerecorded,  where we have the weekend for extra lessons and to deal with the info overload.\nWe also missed some interaction on the slack forum. it was kind of dead. Questions remained unanswered. Perhaps make arrangements when someone from code institute can help answer questions. \nI think you can get a lot further on solo learn or freecodecamp, with the same amount of time to spend. We're going to try that now.",

From the first time, I heard about code Institute and reading about their course outlines, I was inspired to dive into it. I tried to test myself with this 5 Day Challenge Course. I putted all myself into the Programm and I got something beneficial about my upskills and life direction into tech, although I already had a little experience, but not specifically into this field of coding.\nAfter the Challenge Course, I am now more encouraged and motivated by the Code Institute Programm Team to further the Course to take up the Full Stack Software Development. I will therefore encourage each and everyone one who wish to upskill or start afresh  to first take up the 5 Day Challenge Course to try his or her ability and if possible further it to take up the Full-Stack course. CodeInstitute is real, effective, reliable, and carreer changer Institute. \nThank you!",

For CSS, all it asked was to copy a line of code or a value onto a specific space. For JavaScript (the 3rd out of 3 exercises of the last day only), it was also just \"copy this line\", and the line was wrong (it generated the wrong response in browser, and if you tried to write the right command, the exercise was marked as incorrect). Before I finished day 5, a sales representative called me congratulating me on the \"great results\" (?!), asking if I had coded before (?!), and started talking about the paid programme. I said I was already enrolled for a bootcamp in another school, and he -very inelegantly- said, \"Sure, you can do these little [name of the school], but if you really want to become a professional, give us a call\". Don't know why so smug. No good school needs to do this, so that's the impression that I get. Also: if the lessons are going to be in the rhythm and style of this 5-day sample, maybe it's a good idea to have a video control panel that allows 4x speed. The man in the video speaks so slowly and makes so many weird long pauses in weird places, that when he's finished the sentence, you don't remember what it was about. There are teleprompters, guys. And some teleprompters even have remote controls so you can adjust the scroll speed to your speaking rhythm.",

Even less, if you've already got some experience. It covers HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics.\nWhile taking part in each challenge there's a little tool that tells you whether or not you've gotten all the assignments correct. If you don't have something correct it gives you a tip on what to do. Although the tip is not that great because it only says: „Did you make an XXX command? Does it have YYY?“, which isn't very helpful in my opinion.\nBut if you're stuck you can join a group for the five days where you can get help from a professional and/or talk to fellow challengers!\nAlso, if you don't get around to finish all of your challenges within the five day period don't worry! In my case they automatically stretched my access to the course until the end of the weekend!\nTldr; it's a really great resource and I recommend it to anyone interested in coding!",

The person I spoke to didn't have any technical knowledge, which is understandable - the program is set up for people with zero experience. But instead of helping me, he merely shifted me to the five day coding challenge... Which I already knew was going to be a waste of time. But I decided to play along since maybe I would be able to speak to someone else. In the coding challenge we were all set up in a slack group. There, again, I asked to speak about my concerns, but my question was left unanswered. And so were my other questions regarding the autograder. All I got were canned responses to talk to onboarding people. The whole system (from what I was able to experience up to that point) is set up in such a way it takes people in and spits them out. There's no room for independent thought / solving edge cases. I say this having the experience of talking to two other institutions where I was able to get my questions escalated to people who could talk to me. And in one of those cases I was able to talk to an instructor where we came to the conclusion that particular bootcamp wouldn't be right for me. I was not able to get that from code institute.",

I had almost no experience with programming at the start of the course. \nOn the plus side:\nTheir student care team is very active and responds quickly\nBeing on the course held me to a deadline\nBecause the coursework is assessed it pushes you to finish off and polish the projects \nThere is a slack community\nIt provides a structure to follow (which technologies)\nThe negative:\n-- They teach things that are factually incorrect. \n-- They do not teach good best practices. That creates problems later on. \n-- They do not explain why they do things, or how things fit together. Core concepts etc. \n-- Added things between videos and not said anything. This means your code doesn’t work properly but you don’t know why.  \n-- Many places where they say 'ok, this bit is hard to understand,  you may need to re-watch the video' but they don't explain really what's happening\n-- They don't teach set up. Course is in gitpod, a  sandbox environment.  don't teach you about development environments, setting up projects etc... \n-- The marking criteria is unspecific\n-- They do not tell you the overall grading system\n-- I was marked down harshly for things that were not in the marking criteria\n--The student care team functions like a badly run HR department. They can’t really do much except ‘take feedback’\n--Slack community support is other students (not teachers)\n--Tutors not available as promised, limited sessions, no help understanding or teaching, not very useful\n--Jobs in their portal not actual coding jobs\nI have been getting through this course with the help of some really great Udemy courses that actually teach you how things work and why. I have also had a lot of help and personal tutoring from my partner who has had to fill in a lot of the gaps. The time I have spent trying to follow along with the bad learning material has actually left me with emotional PTSD, where I end up in tears because i’m so frustrated and angry… days and weeks after I have had to try and learn through them. \nThe closest I can describe my learning experience with them is that feeling you have as a child in a classroom, when the teacher is moving fast and not really explaining things, and you are lost, but they won’t stop or answer questions. The blood pounds in your ears and your chest is tight. You are trapped, you can’t get out because you are in their class all year, you know an exam is coming. You know that you will not do well. The teacher, knowing that you have not been following, still picks on you to answer questions, even though your face is wet with tears. Every day.",

The course was expensive enough and its shouldn't be right to charge someone for something that is inevitable. Everyone can make a silly mistake but even if you do, you still have to pay.

Or at least shown at some parts.\nBut when I finally made to code work... \nYou know that feeling, when you have not been mentally fullfilled for a while, and then you take up a hobby or a temporary project. \nAfter alot of griping and cursing, when it´s done and it just simply, works!\nThat feeling. \nThat is how I felt during this coding challange.\nI hope that you also will feel that way during your Coding run.",

We noticed if we followed your instructions to a T, they did not always work, and it seemed to me that the videos are slightly old.

He is probably very knowledgeable in his subject, but as a teacher he - for us at least - was difficult to understand and we spent have the time rewinding. The CC were out of sync, and the transcript is not easy at all to read. It jumps and no full stops. Sorry. We feel that the rest of the course would need too much effort to understand.",

The course content is updated fairly regularly to reflect the changes in the industry and the biggest thing I have taken from it is that they have taught me the skills to investigate and further my own knowledge. \nThe career support and advice is fantastic, many of my peers are already landing roles in the industry and the community (run on an application called Slack) is amazing! So many aspiring/exisiting developers all offering advice and input.\nOn top of the course, they run hackathon events most months, giving you an opportunity to collaborate in a more \"real-world\" scenario. These events have opened my eyes to even more coding practices and the way things operate within a team. Participation in these also appear to be very well received on CVs.\nOverall, it has been (and continues to be) a thoroughly enjoyable and educational experience...you have to put the effort in, but doing so will lead to a far better experience!",

For those purposes, it worked well enough.\nWhile the coding challenge was not difficult overall, most of the concepts were overly basic in the three languages, I felt it was perhaps too easy in ways it should have been more challenging.\nOne thing that bothered me, when I tried to follow the transcripts that ran with the video segments, is that there are several errors in the transcripts. It's like they only used a computer to create the transcript and didn't have a human double check it. As a native English speaker with no hearing impairments, I could get what I needed from the presenter. However, I could imagine non-native English speakers or those with hearing impairments having serious issues with using the transcripts.\nAs for the content of the code challenge itself, I feel they overhype it a bit in their advertising. Based on what I've learned the very basics are of HTML, CSS and JS from the other online courses I've taken, I feel the coding challenge may not go deep enough to give someone who's a complete newcomer to coding a complete enough taste of the basics to make a truly informed decision if coding is right for them.\nMy main advice to Code Institute: Fix your video transcripts and consider making the Code Challenge two weeks long so you can go deeper with the basics and make the substance of the challenge match the hype you give it.\nAs the Five Day Code Challenge was free, and it served the purposes I had for taking it, I won't critique further.\nJust keep in mind, you get what you pay for.",

This is only the highlights from the issues I faced while attending a course with this college.\nI would like to convey very clearly that I am exceptionally unimpressed with this course. I have found it far below the standards that I would expect from a course partnered with UCD (well technically UCD Professional Academy). Furthermore, I feel the cost of €7995 cannot possibly be justified given the poor quality of the teaching and the course material itself.\nUnfortunately Trustpilot does not provide a big enough comment box to list out my legitimate concerns for courses from this college. for full details go: www. reddit .com/r/DevelEire/comments/k8lrqn/code_institute_anyone/\nThe biggest issue:\nChanging assessment criteria while students are actively working on the projects in question (initially without telling the applicable students). When this was raised a response of \"simplifying assessment criteria to inflate pass rates is acceptable because employers will not know and it is done all the time in third level education\"... This, in my opinion, is just wrong and confirms that this certificate will not have any real industry value.\nThe promised content was not delivered. Even the Customer Services the Manager for their partnered school admitted that mistakes have been made with this course and that the level of service provided has not met the expectations of any party involved\n[UPDATE BASED ON REPLY] The purpose of this review is not too discuss the issues (all attempts of resolution were provided by your partner college UCD, not CI), but to warn prospective students of the experience I had so they can be aware of the experience they can expect. And so they can be aware that much of the \"programme's different aspects\" promised were not actually provided, and the few that were, were substandard",

        "review": "The course started with the 5 day coding challenge it was made in the way, to make me think that once I pass it, will mean, that I am pretty skilled in this area “of thinking”. It consisted of tasks in HTML and CSS. For somebody who has never touched coding, and does not know that HTM and CSS are very simple tools to learn in coding it is easy to fall in this TRAP to think that you will be good at it. Why not create 5 day coding challenge in JavaScrip or Python, much more complex languages???? \nIt started of well as with HTML and CSS, but the JavaScript and Python modules were intensely complicated, with badly laid out theory, with end module challenges often with elements not corresponding to the course material making the challenges even more confusing. Majority of the time I was left to research the subjects in other resources on my own to understand what I was being taught. \nThe tutor support are not allowed to give you straight answers (I have been taught that many times) plus you have to wait for their support 30/40min to 1.5 hrs. There is a limit of how often in a week you can ask for the support. So, if you have used them twice in a week you are unlikely to be helped third time in the same week or may wait more than 3hours.  The flow of conversation is very slow as tutors (many recent graduates) are talking chatting to other students at the same time. I had to wait for my answers in conversations between 20min to 1.5hrs. 9 out of 10 times tutor’s shift ended during the conversation and I was told to wait for another tutor for help. \nMentor support your have is between 30-60 min three time during your project. 1 when you talk about your idea. 2 when you are in the middle but expectation is that you should have at this stage completed 70% of your work. 3 before the submission and when project is completed. This is not a help really as ideally you need at least 1-3hr every week to discuss many aspects and problems as this is a completely new field for you. The mentor would often send me to research my queries anyway. This is simply some tick box exercise for the provider of the course to make it look compliant and encouraging. \nThey say that you can use 24hr support in Slack, used by students asking questions that are drown in a despair slowly learning that they have had wasted their money. There are many bugs in the tutorial content and for that reason, the end challenges do not work but you are not able to know whether that is your error in the challenge or something else. No to mention spelling mistakes. Tutorials refer to Cloud9 but you have to use completely different GitPod … this list can go on, it is very depressing.  \nIf you struggle with the content there is nobody to help you. Student support just make calls to you to tick box as they do not actually listen to your struggles. They count their time on the phone making sure it is not extended and you end up with no substantial support to what you are asking for. \nFor every late submission you pay extra fee, for every resubmission you pay extra fee. With the above support it could be an endless and costly experience. \nThis course is for people with prior knowledge of coding in all offered coding languages. For a beginner is an absolute nightmare as you don’t know what you are doing therefore a lot of support is needed. You will be left completely abandoned with your issues the only real savior can be a developer friend if he/she has a lot of time to give you some attention.\nCI put a lot of careful attention into getting you into the course 5day VERY EASY coding challenge, with many email reminders, marketing and getting your money. I can give them 5* for the three areas. You will be better off studying on your own. Do not pay for this course unless you have a lot of previous coding experience or you are a beginner but a complete genius! Otherwise, you will pay thousands to learn how to google or use Stack Overflow. \nI have chucked this course in the middle of it’s run, learning from free and better explained resources  and have never been happier since.",

There wasn't any assessment they were just happy to take £6000 off me, during that period we had to home school our two children and I was eventually made redundant. My mentor who was based outside of the UK had an appalling connection whenever we spoke and eventually resigned, I was allocated a new mentor who never made contact. My wife also had to leave her job for medical reasons, I requested extensions which were not granted so I asked to leave the course to focus on my family. To retrain in an entirely new field requires a lot of time, effort and concentration and my circumstances had changed significantly. I asked for a partial refund as I had only accessed the online portal and had not submitted any projects, this was denied for no justifiable reason. I have since read in other reviews that partial refunds have been issued so I am hoping that somebody will now contact me to discuss. I am so disappointed with the lack of empathy and understanding of peoples circumstances during the most difficult of my and many peoples lives. Be careful if you are looking to sign up, many people may have had a more positive experience than myself but I would approach with caution.",

For example for making my recipe website, I couldn't really customize it, and sometimes even though the code was correct and worked fine, it was marked wrong because it wasn't the exact code you expected me to write. So the exercises weren't open to creativity and flexibility.

Editing their 1k+ products site on 2 separate CMS platforms meant little to no coding but the desire and interest grew. With this in mind I recently enrolled in the Full Stack Software Development (E-commerce Applications) Course at the Code Institute.  At an early stage it is proving to be a very positive experience. The support from the every growing community of staff, students, alumni, mentor and companies connected with the Code Institute is second to none. \nOn my journey to date the careers team have been phenomenal. There is much excitement with the newly launched Careers Hub and I can see why. The value in the hub is immediately evident. I've taken so much from only a few lessons which I intend to implement shortly. \nAfter only 3 weeks in the course I signed up for my first hackathon organised by CI in conjunction with Trust in SODA. It was daunting, challenging and intense to begin but so worth doing it. The subject matter of accessibility in the workplace so so relevant. It's an area CI promote early on in the course and great to have that foundation as a developer both ethically and from a legalities area in mind. Working in an agile environment I engaged with an amazing team eager to support each other and put our every best in. I understand there will be plenty more hackathons and would encourage others to join in no matter their skills or stage progression to date. It was accounted for when the teams were assigned. \nI've only just scratched the surface with this course and excited to see what else is coming up. From what I have experienced so far it is a very engaged and constantly active international community and is only going from strength to strength!",

The fact that we were offered the opportunity to build a project as part of an agile team which we could then showcase to an external panel of judges for a wide range of industry backgrounds was absolutely phenomenal and an invaluable experience. Meeting industry experts and having their feedback for our projects provided a greater understanding of the industry as a whole and how to prepare for the work place both from a working perspective and an interview skills perspective. I would like to see more opportunities like this in the future because I think it provides immense value to CI students and even alumni currently on the job hunt! It was definitely an opportunity to enhance both technical and team work skills which I throughly enjoyed and I am looking forward to the next hackathon to build my skill set even more whilst making new friends.",

There were options to join an online community and get familiar with using the 'Slack' App that provided support from mentors and other students. I found this option incredibly helpful as the people would come to ones rescue when in need. Even though this is an online course, the feeling of community is strong and conducive to success in each of the challenges.

With the help of my team members we completed all tasks and fulfilled the brief.\nI'm glad I took the opportunity to participate in the Hackathon, it was a lot of fun and I learned a tonne about working as a team in a coding environment.\nI'd definitely recommend it and I'm looking forward to the next Hackathon.",

        "review": "Although I did benefit from taking this course to some extent, I have more than a few reservations about it and would honestly not recommend it, particularly if you are investing your own savings in the hope of a career change, you could be bitterly disappointed.  \nFirst of all, if you are hesitating do not fall for their free five-day coding challenge, it is far superior to the “full stack” course (like the all option model car dealers put on display!) and is designed to lure customers in what is, at best, a mediocre course sold at an extortionate price.  \nFor me, the biggest disappointment is the complete lack of any pedagogy throughout the course. You won’t speak to any teacher but will be showed hundreds of mind-numbing videos, presenting different pieces of code, that you are expected to reproduce pretty much exactly, without any understanding of what you are doing. To make matters worse, some of them will be out of date by the time you have watched them. The quality of the material is inconsistent ranging from good (HTML)to poor (Javascript and Jquery) and contains various typos and errors. The lack of pedagogy is particularly evident in the harder sections of the course (Javacript, Python, Databases), to be competent in those requires a lot more (for me at least) than what this course covers which is disappointing for the price. \nThe interactive content on repl.it is more interesting even though the tasks that you must complete are generally too easy, however, if you decide to try the “challenge tasks” you will be lucky if you can understand the intricate instructions! \nOne strength of the course is its support system of tutoring and mentoring, which is decent (depending on who you talk to), but again it does not quite live up to the promises of the brochure (24/7 support...). You interact with tutors through a live chat but waiting times can be quite long (up to 90 minutes), not ideal when you are working on a tight schedule. Some tutors are brilliant and really go out of their way to help you, some could not care less (“do what it says on the video”).   \nWhen you’re working on one of the compulsory projects and are trying to implement some functionalities that are slightly different from those shown in the videos they will often say “we don’t offer help on things that are not in the course” yet for some project you are expected to go beyond what is in the course and do your own research because “it’s a useful developer’s skill”. \nYour mentor is a professional of the industry who is supposed to help you with your projects, mine was nice enough but could not really get down to my level and most of the time I had no idea what he was talking about! \nIn the Slack forum, you will find answers to a lot of questions but because most of my questions had already been answered, I could not really interact with anyone. Also, judging on the conversations, it was clear that a lot of people on the course were not beginners or had a far better understanding about the course content, which made it rather intimidating. \nThe “full stack“ course is designed to be marketable, and make you believe that it can get you the basic skills to be able to work with anything from HTML to Javascript, Python, databases etc. In reality, it just brushes on those topics, shows you one or two example which you then copy and that’s it.  I was able to complete 3 out 4 modules without really understanding anything that I was doing and just fell short on the last one for lack of time. \nIn terms of dealing with issues and offering extensions they were fairly flexible in the end, but it did take a few unpleasant phone conversations to get there, which did not make for a good customer experience (even though you hear a lot about good UX in the course!). \nTo conclude, I would say that if money is not an issue, if you need a diploma to acknowledge your skills as a developer or if you have previous coding experience and want to extend your skills, then this course might be for you. Otherwise, if you are looking tentatively at new career options, I would recommend looking at cheaper courses and free material, there are plenty available on the web (just check some You Tube channels) whose quality is just as good. There is not much, in my opinion, that justifies the asking price for this course and even though I did learn a few things, I regret the money I have spent and feel like a fool for falling for their marketing.",

It was very dynamic (HTLM, CSS, & Java) at the end of the course even though I couldn’t finish on time, it was lovely to see how they payed l attention and could tell I needed extra access, I still ran out of time but I felt empowered having learnt fantastic new things, it was value adding and gave me the strengthen that it’s never too late to start. Lastly I will say it was clear and easy to navigate making the experience joyful, and the interaction and experiences of others on slack made the journey easier knowing I was not struggling with a few things alone. I can go on and on but it was a fantastic experience 😘",

There are plenty of challenges along to way to sharpen one's new knowledge and skills, and a series of graded projects to prove ones understanding of the concepts.\nOne of the best things is the excellent support structure with Mentors, Tutors, and Student Support. On top of that, there is a vibrant and supportive global Slack Community with peers willing and able to help.\nThe Slack Community Leads and peers share knowledge through sessions, such as Object-Oriented Python and JavaScript programming, Flask and Django frameworks (above and beyond what is covered on the course), and the use of new technologies.\nYou will receive a solid understanding and application of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask and Django frameworks, Bootstrap and Materialize, SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and no-SQL (MongoDB) databases, and some of the latest front-end frameworks.\nThe graded projects solidify your knowledge and skills and provide you with a portfolio to share with potential employers.\nOne other point that is brilliant are the frequent Hackathons where you work with team members from across the globe on a full-stack solution.

I do wish that the Code Institute representatives were more active within the channel, there wasn't much connection established during the week.  I can understand that the purpose of the channel was for peers to help solve each others' problems, however when it came to individuals struggling to find their certificate etc, I saw very little help from the representatives and these are not the kinds of problems that peers are meant to tackle for the purpose of this course.  \nThe webinar at the end of the week provided some insight as to how the coding industry works and what employers in relevant fields are looking for, although a lot of it was the promotion of their Bootcamp course, understandably so.  It's not entirely a negative point, it is very useful if individuals are interested in taking up the course in the first place.  It's something to consider for some people.  \nAll in all, I have learned the very basics and it has given me a boost in being able to learn more by myself and work on my own thing.

The explanations were thorough- especially, in making sure that most details which may be very obvious to someone who has coded and used programming interfaces in prior, but not to someone who hasn't, were explained.\nOn this latter note however, I feel it would have been very useful to potentially explain further about the sub-elements entered into the head element, as this part was sort of brushed over (to find out more about these parts I turned to a very useful youtube tutorial for this). I would have also appreciated if further information was provided surrounding how you actually get the website up and running on the internet- and further discussion surrounding on how the script you write is first stored locally, and what one can do to then get a domain name and have your webpage stored on a server.\nAdditionally, I feel that the tutor component which was supposed to be available during the process was limited. When going through the challenges I had very specific questions which were related to, for example adding style to specific words instead of paragraphs or sections, or that were outside of the scope of the specific code of a challenge exercise. For these types of questions I felt it was hard to seek help via the tutor function.\nOverall though, I felt the 5-day challenge was great, and its structure of mixing between shot-concise videos and exercises made it enjoyable, and easy to follow.",

        "review": "I had an amazing journey with the Code Institute. I began the course with a real appetite and a desire to come out the other end with a Diploma and the skills and knowledge to know what it takes to build something using code.\nThe course content is housed on a very easy to navigate learning management system. It guided me through 12 modules covering Html, CSS, Javascript, Git, Bootstrap, Jquery, Jasmine Testing, Python, Mongo DB, Mysql Flask and finally Django.\nEach module feeds into a core learning element which is cemented by means of submitting your very own Project - This is where the real learning happens. Following modules and lessons is fine - and you can nod your head through all of them. But when you get to the project - the gloves are off and it's time to get your hands dirty for real.\nThe first project, which is using just Html and CSS scared the socks off me - I really had no idea how to go about it - and its a battle with yourself to find a way through this using what has been taught, but also learning how to find answers on your own - a skill so invaluable once learned.\nAnd that's the hidden Module that runs throughout this Diploma - You must learn that the course is a roadmap, but you must learn how to problem solve and utilise Google and any other means to overcome issues and bugs. This is after all the most precious skill of all and cannot be taught. So don't expect to be hand-fed every answer - the lessons are cleverly written to give you the core information, but many of the challenges and especially the projects will require you to be resourceful and find answers outside of the course content.\nOther than Google you will find the Slack student community is an amazing resource of fellow students and Alumni - all willing to help one another and nudge you in the correct direction - again here - do not expect to get the answers on a plate, but you will definitely get the help you need. \nAs Slack is made up of your fellow students it should be used with the proper respect for a fellow student, and is a place where you may ask for help - but not demand it. If Slack is unable to help there is an excellent support structure.\nTutor support can be contacted if you run into an issue you just cannot solve, again it is better for your learning journey to exhaust any other means first, but not to the extent where you get desperate or despondent - these guys are really smart and will help you out and point you in the right direction.\nOverall I had a really good experience, but you will need to go into this with the correct attitude. It is your learning journey - don't expect to be hand-fed everything and be prepared to work hard for it - It's your future after all!! If you think that describes you - just go for it with both hands - I can promise you - You won't be disappointed!",

        "review": "The course is not cheap, and there are cheaper or free alternatives, e.g. Freecodecamp, which I tried before. But I find the course a good path for someone who wants to start from zero and have a structured process with clear objectives and deadlines. Although it was quite stressful at times, it definitely helped me to be more organized and staying on deadlines. \nThe course videos are easy to follow, working on coding challenges was difficult at times, and i needed to do extra research or sometimes ask for help on student slack. It'd be good to have recommended resources to learn better certain topics. For example, algorithms or BigO notation were not really introduced in the course.\nEach student works on a portfolio of 4 projects with progressively increasing complexity. The project task description seemed to be a bit too short, and lacking some guiding info. I used other students’ projects as an example, in planning, structuring my projects, writing documentation. Your grades depend on ticking all the necessary boxes in project assessment, which was not always clear to me. Some students make very simple projects, but because a project ticked all the boxes, they get a distinction. I tried to achieve more complexity in my projects, and sometimes a minor thing failed my assessment. This felt a bit unfair to overlook efforts put into complexity just because of a small thing, but I guess this is a structured approach. In any case two of my last projects went way over the material taught in the course. \nInitially I planned to complete the course in 6 months, but due to the covid, my family situation and over-complexing my projects, I did that in about 11 months. If you lack on time, I’d recommend not to over-complicate your projects, and you still can learn a lot and get your diploma.\nI had three mentors over the course of 12 months. During planning and implementation of my first three projects I lacked assistance in planning, and during development. My last mentor was quite helpful and gave me good ideas, and answered my complicated questions. Overall, I believe some students are lucky to get good mentors, some are not. \nTutor support was quite good, and I had a lot of challenges in my projects solved with the help of some of the tutors. But not all of them were knowledgeable. \nStudent slack channel is a good resource, where there are a lot of experienced students plus tutors help you to solve your tasks or challenges. \nGenerally, I was supported, but being connected to all of the people and resources only online, I felt some lack of support and guidance, but I guess it just adds to self-learning. \nBefore I started the course, I thought I’d be ready to be hired once I am done. It is not like that though. I still need to learn additional frameworks/libraries, like React, or study algorithms for interviews. The Code Institute could improve this part in creating career paths with additional tech to learn. Or recommend learning some while implementing projects. I know that some students include React (which is not taught by the course) in their last project. \nOverall, the course is not cheap and has areas of improvement, but it gives a good start with a structure to learn and build your portfolio. Of course, you should do research and see if there are free alternatives, but don’t forget that you will have to create a structure for your work, targets for portfolio building, and follow your deadlines. If you look at other Bootcamps, besides comparing price and curriculum, have a look at what portfolio you will have on the way out, and check Github projects of students from different bootcamps. Code Institute definitely gave me a structure of how to plan, implement(code, comments, file system & names, etc), and document (readme) my projects.",

Also you are told to make your own code and keep evolving it during the course, but at the next step your code is replaced by the \"teachers\" code so there's no point putting a personal touch to the challange.

Turns out I thoroughly enjoyed it & I am glad I took the plunge as it was a good, basic introduction to coding. The challenge was structured well with videos explaining the basics of HTML, css & JavaScript and after each there was usually a practical challenge where you could apply the principals explained in the video. You also have access to a Slack group where you can get assistance and ask questions if needed, although I didn’t personally use this as I found everything covered was really straightforward.  I’d say I spent approx 30-45 mins each day on this over the 5 days. It’s not possible to progress any quicker and complete the whole thing in one or two days as there is only one section unlocked per day. Towards the end of the challenge you are invited to a webinar which covers off next steps etc for those who are interested & I found this quite informative also.  All in all, if you are curious about coding & want to test the waters to see if it’s something you might enjoy / have an aptitude for, then I recommend taking the 5 day challenge.",

This project taught me so much, which I would not get from self learning etc. \nThe biggest asset was the teamwork involved, which replicates how it would work in the real world where you are working on projects with other people.

Good placed advert, while I was studying from tutorials about visual art software processes.\n- advert was inspirational, I actually wanted to find out more about your company\n- very good marketing step to allow people try your 5day free coding challenge to get a taste of your course\n2. I like to develop myself in all spheres of my life, so from my point of view, I was really excited to start.\n3. Your UI is very clear and I really like the idea of having an instructional video with text next to it. It could help a lot to people who are not English tongue natives.\n- You provide a good support.\n- I am a Visual Artist, and even though I know it's about text education, I am missing helpful visuals (not talking about well done instructional videos). By my option education should be about fun, and therefore motivation.\n4. I am not sure if I would remember how to build the site from memory, but I believe with your student program, you have much more possibilities to practise, and therefore your full program students are surely more experienced. (The same principle like playing musical instruments from notes, as more practise, as more fluently played etuda, and therefore more emotional joy.)\n5. I would love to continue with a full program, but the financial is not very desirable.\n6. I really enjoyed clean studying in times when I actually had time for it. Instructions were clear, and I had a really pleasant experience of studying with your 5 day free coding challenge. In these 5 days, I gained overview about the principles and about simple structures of building.\nI am grateful for this experience. Thank you.",

I entered the course in September 2019 and finished in December 2020. The situation is I want to leave my current work for a new career and I hope this will be able to do that. The 5-day coding challenge is a good introduction to the actual course structure, with different modules laid out on different days as a sort of schedule.\nComing from a background with no knowledge of code the course is gentle in the beginning with about 1/4 of the total course working with HTML, CSS and a little Bootstrap. Then it leads on to Javascript and jQuery in the Interactive Frontend module, a particularly bumpy step for many students, this is a common thread in the Slack community but thankfully help can be gained from tutor or mentor support, even other students depending on particulars.\nAfter half the course is done you start reading the Data Centric Module which is all about using Python and Flask with noSQL backend using mongoDB, combined with some Javascript for nice frontend features. At this point the Javascript starts to make more sense. The last module is Full Stack Frameworks with Django which is another Python framework where you will learn database modelling in SQL, and tie several api services together such as AWS, SQL, Heroku and Stripe to produce an impressive homemade project.\nIn each of the 4 modules you are required to produce a web app which will be examined by Code Institute, and you will be getting some impressive feedback with scores for different aspects and some interesting feedback. Since you will be doing several practice projects throughout the course you are not allowed to plagiarize but some boilerplate code or particular components can be borrowed as long as you declare it in the Readme. Readme documentation is something important and the Markup language is discussed as well.\nThese projects will be scored and the average of these determines your final score. For my final project I had to extend submission by 2 months (in 1 month increments) which was fine by Student Care, and these extensions do not affect your score.\nOn my part time schedule I mostly had to put in 1 or 2 hours per day, I could skip a day and work it up in the weekends at times, but if I lagged behind I could always call in to the Student Care team who were always very relaxed with requests of extension.\nLast but not least the price tag is indeed a treshold, but I think it's a comparably good price for the available support, they keep calling to check up on you, and there is also one-on-one tutor support available, mentor sessions for the examina projects and helpful staff available in the Slack Channel as well as other students who were sometimes able to help me. Even though the Student Care is not about learning I have to mention that there are some gentle souls working there who are always nice to talk to.\nI am currently in the \"Careers\" module which is a nice addition since many of the students are looking for career changes.\nThere are webinars with invited tech companies and experts willing to look over your documentation and do a mock interview, and it's all there for your help.\nSo in final words, I would rate the course at 5/5 even though it's a bumpy ride entering functional programming, but it's because of the nature of backend programming. I would recommend the course for anyone, if you can manage the 5-day coding challenge.",

However, the transcripts' quality was somewhat inconsistent: sometimes, punctuation was non-existent, making it difficult to separate the sentences of the transcript without the audio. Other times, there was no transcript at all (not that the transcript was necessary to understand the gist of the lectures).\nThe challenges were enjoyable, as I could clearly see that my knowledge was building up as I progressed through them. One small annoyance for me was the lack of guide for the syntax of HTML coding - by that I mean whether I had to use quotes or not for example. (I used Chrome on Windows 10 and I eventually figured it out by trial-and-error for each challenge, but I still have no idea when I need to use quotes)\nI did not use Slack that much, but it might have helped me figure out why submitting the quiz was so buggy - I clicked the 'Submit' button, but I did not receive immediate feedback on whether I guessed correctly. It just displayed something like 'Submitting quiz', as if it was processing my answer (for an eternity)\nOverall, my initial expectations were clearly met with the '5 Day Coding Challenge', even if some minor issues came up during my experience.",

[I previously stated that 24 hour tutoring support wasn't available for 1 month out of 3 that I was on the course for. Turns out that this was less substantial than I remembered but was true for one period of about a week early in December and one period early in September.] Their preferred channel for getting help (Slack) is just far too slow unless you want to spend hours doing something which should really only take ten minutes. Getting stuck on something at the wrong time thus means you might just be stuck. The only functional tool for me was searching the history of the various slack channels hoping someone had had the same problem as me. The only hint you are ever given on a challenge is that the tools for the solution can be found in lesson x, which often isn’t the case at all. \nMaybe other people have had better experiences with their mentors but mine seemed either stressed or tired, or both, on all occasions. Perhaps people who work all day shouldn't spend their entire evenings giving advice and helping people. One mentoring session he only managed to confuse me and actually ruined the logical integrity of the code that I had written, giving me hours of work just to get back to where I was before (as I understood nothing of what he was doing but was trusting him blindly). As the course itself is hardly any better than can be found online for free or for much smaller fees at other places, this is basically what you're paying for in terms of substance. 20 allocated hours, no matter how good your mentor is, simply cannot be worth 6000 euros.  \nI left the course early and they were kind enough to forfeit part of the tuition in spite of having no contractual obligation to do so. However, once I left the issues didn't end. Their communication over the leaving period was slow and the way they formulated themselves was [--always ambiguous to the point of trying to keep me on and not having to deal with-- edit: more precisely student support and finance office gave me contradictory indications early on and finance communication was slow and ineffective and almost landed me in extra financial trouble afterwards, asking for an extra instalment of the tuition whilst at the same time wanting to cut off my financing from CSN late on the 23rd of December before I had received the money for that instalment, and where I would not have been able to sort any personal financing alternatives over Christmas. Needless to say I had to postpone the final decision another week for administrative purposes even though I would have wanted to quit earlier and started expressing that in the beginning of December.]. Once I pushed them though things went through and I guess they really only forfeited the outstanding tuition as CSN (Swedish student loan services) stand as guarantors on the fees and I can at any time tell them that I am no longer studying and thereby no longer even be able to pay. More than two weeks have past since I left and they haven't supplied me with the documents that I have requested upon leaving [edit: and which they promised to supply more than three weeks ago now]. The Finance Manager is not replying my emails and I can only say that I've left the course feeling incredibly bitter about everything and regretting the experience wholeheartedly. If you want to learn how to code, there are much better options than the Code Institute.\nExtra: Code Institute have written that they refute my claims. On one point I will after review retract what I said and have explained that above. On another point a clarification was necessary. The rest of it is simply me sharing my experience, and subjective as it is, it is however also absolutely irrefutable by nature of what it is. The review was also flagged by the Code Institute \"because they believe it contains harmful or illegal content\" which seems like a slightly excessive reaction. At least they are quick enough to reply and react to things which might affect their reputation and they haven't been trying to call me this much since the period I started the course...",

The course was very easy to follow, with great quality instructional videos working through everything. There were several mini assignments per day which helped put learning into practice. At the end, you get a great certificate recognising your achievements. The only thing I would change is that it would be great if these assignments could contribute towards your grade, rather than the grade being based only on the relatively simple end of lesson quizzes.",

The required answer is % but it is not made clear that typing percent or percentage is incorrect. I feel any of the three should be acceptable if the question isn't further clarified.\nAlso right at the start of the course you had a prominent typo. I'll let you find it.",

Recently filled out a careers survey which suggested IT is my most suitable career, which actually doesn't surprise me so much: however, I don't discuss it socially, and (unusually) reluctant to order books for research purposes as was evidently looking for something more operational. \nOne of the great things about this course is despite being a complete beginner it does what any good starter course would do and introduces the student to the basics (core languages covered include HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and making it clear what works and what doesn't. For someone such as myself submitting something that doesn't work (on day two repeatedly) can be daunting. however literally by the end of the day everything was completed to the correct standard. Getting everything done on the day, via research or even trial and error, was a key strength of this course: honestly can't remember if everything *had* to be done on the day in question, but in this instance I didn't allow the assignments to overrun.\nAlways felt there was a lot of support on offer both from tutors and fellow students although ultimately saw in the last year my current decade in my garage with a laptop and music rig for five days until everything had been done; it's hard to realise that can now actually code, albeit provisionally. The after-course support has been very positive & proactive and while I did consider four stars (five stars can be a bit of a cliché) couldn't think of anything off-putting about it; the key thing is being able to understand everything and make progress appropriately which this was well designed for achieving. Grateful to have been able to do it; considering a career change and doing my research.",

        "review": "I have completed the 9-month Full-Stack Web Development Course, so my review is based on that, not the 10-day coding challenge. I did this course from October 2019 to final submission in July 2020 (And some optional re-submissions to raise my grade after). I scored a First Class Honours. It was a programming rollercoaster. If you are considering this course, be ready for the ride.\nOverall, I found the course fantastic in what it teaches, if you are willing to commit yourself. Now that I've finished, I believe there is no programming language I cannot take on and learn to be competent in after a few months. It gave me that ability, that confidence and the know-how. That's potent. I would give it five stars just for that, but there are some serious faults which I am going to address first.\nGood-to-know Details:\n- Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python\n- Other stuff: Bootstrap, Materialize (should be removed IMO), MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Flask, Django. \n- Can be completed entirely online.\n- Support is through phone, email, chat and Slack. Some support is 24/7. Covers from course info to tech and career support.\n- Course duration can vary, either 9-month or one year. It depends on your method of entry.\n- Cost is €6500. You can also apply through Springboard in Ireland. It will lower the cost to €600 (or free) depending on your circumstances. They request previous experience for acceptance.\nCons:\n- Disorder: some lessons are a bit messy, useful course material is scattered throughout their support systems, etc. The worst con for me was this.\n- Support is inconsistent. Some brilliant, others useless, or redirect you to other supports, that also redirect you. You can tell nearly everyone works remotely.\n- At times, you are really on your own. You must have the will to drive yourself.\n- Grading is inconsistent. It's more like a lottery than a coherent system. Their own example projects wouldn't get the mark they indicate. I made a very long complaint about it. I heard they have since updated it.\n- Lots of material needs a refresh. It's still relevant learning, but they've updated the systems they use to teach, and the videos have not followed suit.\n- The course material isn't always up to the level they expect you to reproduce for a project.\nNeutral:\n-  The course is often updated. It would be a Pro if they prepared the updates better. They've recently created one of the highest quality modules I've seen online. At the same time, they changed online IDE mid-course, didn't update the videos and just let students be the debuggers when they encountered problems. Not Cool.\n- They leave you to your own devices. Pace, project design, topics etc. Double-edged sword. I liked it except for when it came to inconsistent grading. Giving free-reign for project design but expecting set requirements for the project was a contradiction in my experience.\n- The course is intensive; more intensive than difficult.\n- Self-drive required.\nPros:\n- European University Credits, one of the only University rated online Bootcamps (maybe the only one)\n- Course material is well-balanced and thorough.\n- Genuinely useful test projects make up part of the course.\n- Useful Milestone feedback.\n- The overall teaching arch is well thought out. By the end of the course, I was programming things in days that had taken me weeks in the beginning. Understanding is built step-by-step, and you experience your own progress.\n- Builds self-confidence, capability and outside-the-box skills as a programmer.\n- Teaches you to use all available real-world supports and resources available.\n- Can build a fully-fledged e-commerce site by the end of the course.\n- Learn four languages, and several frameworks, DBs and libraries. I ended up learning plenty of things that are not present in the course. \n- By the end, you have learned great learning methods you can use to teach yourself any Programming language or framework. And have the confidence to do so.\n- Lots of seminars, web-chats, lessons, etc.\n- Extra-curricular projects run frequently.\n- Staff and support are friendly.\n- Lots of support channels, some 24/7.\n- Phone and career support is of the highest quality.\n- Career support will check in every so often after finishing the course.\n- Take feedback very seriously and do act on it.\n- They provide an Online IDE. You can finish the course only online if you choose, no installs required. I did the whole course on a 2014 (Verge of Death) Chromebook.\nAll in all, I highly recommend this course to anyone willing to push themselves for max potential. You will learn beyond the scope of your expectations. Be ready to work.",

You will also be assigned a mentor who will help you with the projects you do. Then there is also assistance from other mentors who work during the weeks that you can contact if you have questions.\nThe projects have been really fun to build and helped me understand the more abstract parts of databases and the use of an api.\nI highly recommend Code Institute, you will learn a lot and it's going to be hard but fun.",

The course leads you through creating a webpage, but after typing in all your custom content (in this case a food recipe), you move on to the next stage and all of your code is gone, replaced with the default, \"How to make tea\" recipe. This happens at every stage, so unless you keep a copy of your code and paste it every time, it's easier but less fulfilling to make the default \"Tea\" recipe page.\nBecause a lot of the information is contained in videos, you often find yourself switching back and forth between the coding page and the previous video page fighting with the video's navigation bar, instead of having the material to hand on the same page. This can become frustrating if you have just forgotten a small detail like where a : or > should go.\nThe integration of font awesome is based on the old 4.7 version, which can cause issues if you try to use the up-to-date v5.0 or its icons, which are incompatible and will be marked as incorrect even if you do use it successfully.\nThe whole course is littered with typos, and although not within the code it still leaves you wondering if the full-price course is equally lackadaisical in its presentation.\nSo all-in-all, there is definitely good material here and while I do appreciate that this is a free course, it's lacking the polish and ease-of-use of some of its rivals.",

You are assigned a mentor who works closely with you through your projects and gives constructive feedback and advice, and for your hard to help questions you go to the tutors. I honestly believe the course is worth every penny as it is a huge stepping stone to a career in development, go into this course with an open mind and a willingness to learn and work hard outside of the course material.\nI give CI a rating of 5 due to the constant support they offer, constant check-in calls. They really make you feel apart of their team as they work so closely with you.\nI can only imagine how amazing the course will be with their upcoming material!",

My Son was Just about 10 months old and I felt I needed to make some changes to provide a better life for him. I was also buying house at the same time, so needed some time to steer fully clear of all the financial; pitfalls  that come with buying a house I also work full time and we are a single income family with low income (I still do and we still are). \nHowever the (now looking back very unscrupulous) salesman offered me a discount to the course, saying that The price of the course would go up the week after. So weighing things up I felt that saving was important to me. so I paid £4500 (everything I had in savings after the deposit and other payment for the house purchase). literally every single penny. I was assured that I could study at my own pace and that if I needed, extensions were available.\nSo I started the course, my wife was diagnosed with post natal depression and the time I had to put in to the course was very limited as I am working full time and caring for a my son who is barely a toddler. For the next 8 months or so, this is the case and despite me signing a contract saying I would receive regular contact from mentors, I hear not a peep from anyone. \nSo my wife is better and I start to make headway with the course. A few months later my wife is diagnosed with a condition called Hyperemesis gravidarum that means she is is very very sick for the whole pregnancy (same as her first pregnancy with our son). This again limits my ability to complete the course Until the baby is born as I am caring for a sick wife and also our son. Our son starts pre-school, this frees up a small window of time for me to start my course again. However my time to complete the course is up (despite being given assurances that I could \"study at my own pace\"- don't believe me? It is still the exact wording used in code institute adverts that I am bombarded with on Facebook).\nI pay £1200 for 6 month extension, in instalments - I genuinely do not have the money this time, I have changed jobs and taken a pay cut to reduce the amount of stress from work as I have family commitments and want to finish my course desperately. Only God knows how I pass the credit check to achieve this and I prayed the whole few minutes it took to process that application. In hindsight i should have cut my losses there but I was desperate to finish my course, desperate for a better life and these guys knew how to take advantage of me. I start my course again as all my previous work is deleted.\nMy 2nd child is born. My wife is feeling better, but again soon she is suffering from post natal depression. I am trying to keep everything together I make good progress with my course, then lockdown starts and My son cannot attend pre-school anymore so Time to complete the course is a premium. Last week my 6 month extension ran out (I did not receive any support from these mysterious mentors during this time either) and both Learning people and Code institute refused to give me any further time to complete my course. So I have no qualifications, and I lost my life savings. I get paid £10/hour. \nThe conversation that I had with both these organisations a few days ago was deeply upsetting for me and I pretty much feel like a condemned man. I was told by learning people that there was no chance of paying for a further extensions as they had a \"moral obligation\" not to give it to me, but literally in the same sentence and breath offered me two other courses worth £2500 and £6000. \nIn the end all my experience can do is act as a cautionary tale, because there is literally nothing I can do against this corporate block of an organisation who wanted my money and got it all. The only gain I have is that I now understand that neither of these organisations really care if you progress or make it within the IT field. The education provided is poor and there little if any duty of care to the student.",

I felt so excited but I controlled myself to give myself time and do one every day.\nI highly recommend the course for people willing to have a changing career as well I suggest for people that are not understanding the code properly to have a second look because every character matters and a missing word can keep you busy for a while. \nCheers!",

The code challenges that was given to you after watching a video, was basically the video they did.\nSo in order to complete the challenges, one could basically just copy what they did in the video. That itself reduces the learning curve in my opinion. Now, people could argue that you could chose not to copy what they do in the video and instead do it by memory or using google. But let's be real, people are lazy and if there's a chance for a shortcut, people usually take it.\nHowever, this could easily be improved (in my opinion) by adding some extra challenges to the code, or having deliberate errors that people would need to fix within the code itself before it works as intended.\nAll in all, the diploma is great to have. I just feel like I haven't earned it because it was too easy. I might add that I actually have an M.Sc in Computer Science but I feel like even without it, this was a bit too easy.\nThe CSS part was actually really good though.\nAll in all, I love what they do with Code Institute and I don't know how the skill level of the other courses are, but this was my review after taking my first course.",

However, distance learning means for the CI (and many others) delivering video lessons, providing a forum for mutual support and a mentor sometimes (not sure many hours). Therefore -- in my understanding -- it is a self taught course with video tutorials and some human support. There is no live interaction with a tutor.\nSimilar educational videos for the course are available from other vendors at about 20-40 EUR each, of even cheaper with a subscription. That is why I think that nearly 6,000 EUR is a bit too much for the CI course.\n For examples, the videos in total could cost 150-200 EUR plus 52 hours (one hour per week) of mentorship at 25 EUR/hour = 1,300 EURO, total MAX 1,500 EUR. With CI overheads, profit, etc could be reasonable of it was 2,500 - 3,000 EUR. Which is half of its current price. Too bad.",

The challenges were great because making you do the code as well yourself and at times giving you liberty to add your own spin gave a greater understanding of how to code.

        "review": "Amazing experience ! I just wanted to share with you here, how I found out myself during 5 Day Coding Challenge created by Code Institute. I am a person who wants to change career path. In recent months, for obvious reasons, there have been very many advertisements about web design training. Recently I was looking for information about how to best gain knowledge of coding and how to find a correct learning source. One day on my FB profile appeared info about CI 5-day coding challenge. I just signed up to verify and check if this might be something for me. I studied the information available on their website and I really liked what I saw. As a person without complete experience in the field of hi-tech, I need a compendium of knowledge that will provide me with access to reliable and updated information, care and experience of the best specialists on the market, and formal confirmation as a certificate. I assumed that Code Institute provide a lot of support for their students and this is exactly what code-newbies need. My impressions of the 5 day challenge are only but very positive. After registering, you will receive a link to the educational platform by e-mail. Then on the first day you will receive a video with a summary of the knowledge you need. Next to the audio-video version there is a text on the screen that allows novices to follow the teacher, kind of subtitles for the movie, which I find very helpful. Then you get a task to solve and an example of how the final result should look like. There is also a short quiz at the end of each module. The 5-day challenge is designed to create your first interactive website with minimal time, using the basics of 3 languages ​​HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The challenge says that an hour a day is enough to study the materials and complete the task. In my case it took longer, but I consider that I am a beginner and have no coding experience or basics and my English level is not tech specific. Each day was an adventure that brought a visual final result - simple website. I decided to challenge myself and following the tips I tried to do own web instead of recreating what was given. I was able to complete the task successfully. It gave me more motivation and confirmation that I could possibly try to enter the IT industry. I forgot to mention that you can consult your teachers and other students on the slack chat platform, if you have any doubts about solving tasks or other technical problems. During the challenge, you also have access to support from career advisers and I find the contact with them professional, wonderful and very motivating. To sum up, I think that the 5 day challenge is a kind of introduction to what the bootkamp will look like step by step. For 5 days you become a student at the Code Institute, which can be very helpful if you want to find out if this form of learning suits you. There are many advantages. You can adjust your study time to the free time you have and want to spend on learning, it's very flexible here. You get all possible materials and access to continuous support, clearly defined instructions and an assessment of your results. Knowledge that Code Institute has accumulated in its proprietary courses was created in cooperation with many industry specialists, which ensures that you have access to a good source of information. I think important is that after completing the course you receive a university-level confirmation and certificate, which is still required in many companies to receive an invitation to a work interview. From here, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to participate in this interesting challenge experience. I recommend it to anyone who has doubts or is considering a career path in IT or also for the cyber adventure itself. Thank you very much to Code Institute for sharing knowledge and experience on such a large scale. I wish everyone, teachers, advisors, coworkers, graduates and future students every success in every field.",

Yes, you get a response from the student care team to a negative review you leave here or there, asking if there was anything they can do to help rectify any bad feelings. Once you make a suggestion, they bluntly turn you down.\nMy suggestion, or question, was how to go from here, after the end of your £6000 subscription, and how to submit the remaining mile stone project. Putting in mind that I stated that tutor support was not needed, as I rarely relied on tutors support anyway and found it more comfortable and easier finding and understanding answers on the web, the answer I got was: ‘As your access to the course has been removed we won't accept or assess any further projects.’\nNo way forward, not even for additional fees. We have your money; your subscription is over, go away and don’t come back. \nHowever, a valuable piece of advice was given by the customer care team: ‘Use systems like Free Code Camp to continue to build on the skills you've developed with us.’ \nThough I developed my skills despite their poor course material and so called ‘mentor support’, this the way forward for anyone wants to pay the code institute thousands of pounds. Simply don’t! The web is full of great stuff, better structured and explained, either for free or for a tiny fraction of what those guys charge you. \n--------\nUpdate:\nThank for your answer. \nI find it quite disappointing that the project I have spent a few months working on has not yet been assessed despite being submitted more than 4 weeks ago. I cannot help but feeling being let down by the team. I am not sure how to go forward from here.\n----- \nFull stack developer course is expensive for the time limit, poor course material and not at all enough on its own, better free online resources and much cheaper individual courses with support offer better and more finance friendly options than code institute. Below average student support if not poor, good follow up for issues though, figure-it-out-yourself approach gone too far when you pay £6000 for 14 months subscription, sales people convince customers support is great with constant follow up phone calls and freezing account when no activity is detected for 3 weeks to encourage students to engage with course material, none of that happened. Towards the end of the subscription you are left to your own devices. Tutors support is poor, call times are limited and inflexible, tutors role is unclear and generally fruitless.  Poor overall experience, positive side is providing course structure; however you can find this for fraction of the price elsewhere. A whole amount of £6000 has gone for the most part to waste when much better customer friendly alternatives are available online.",

I need not have worried. \nI gained a taste for it, and I want more. \nThe course was well structured in nice bite-sized pieces, well explained, and with great support, and was very \"do-able\". The customer service was top rate as well. \nIf I had to pick a gripe - the video transcriptions could do with a little editing. As if often the case, some words were mistranscribed. Some of the technical terminologies could be a little hard to grasp at the beginning because often the technical phrases ran into each other, sometimes making a sentence difficult to grasp. \nIt probably did take me more than an hour each day, but that may be because I'm slow at this. Hopefully, my speed will improve. \nBut these are all really tiny, tiny gripes. \nI'd highly recommend the Code Institute and the Five Day Challenge",

The content is subpar to a lot of free content on YouTube. I would actually recommend looking at the likes of freeCodeCamp. Code Institute’s career support is non-existent, and the mentoring was, in my opinion, a waste of time, given my grades were inconsistent with my mentor’s feedback.\nBe aware the majority of positive reviews here are for the free 5-day course. Quite a smart move by Code Institute to flood this page with positive reviews, for free content, drowning out those of us who invested significant sums of money but been severely let down by a lack of content, service, and engagement.\nI signed up initially having taken considerable time to do my due diligence and ensure it was the right fit for me. At the time the right fit meant I could work at my own leisure. A number of months down the line I got an email informing me I had only 6 months left to complete the course. This was completely against what I had been informed as part of the sales call. There was also no stipulation of this in any 'contract'/documentation I received. I was quite annoyed about this dishonesty and after a period of back-and-forth emails we resolved the issue by extending my deadline. But again, this wasn't what I was sold.\nThe course content is well structured. The problem sets throughout help solidify knowledge. I found the depth of knowledge to be quite basic to be honest. I had enquired about whether algorithms and industry best practices were covered. It was confirmed they were. But honestly, by covered, they mean there is a page title with the headers. The content is massively lacking. The algorithms content I didn't even understand at the time what I was being presented with. It was an example of here's how I can do something really slow, but if I make this simple modification to the code, look how much faster it is. There were no prior and post fundamentals to detail concepts. I would advise if you're looking anything other than superficial insights, this isn't the course for you.\nI found the mentoring sessions to be a waste of time. The guidance and feedback I received was inconsistent with the subsequent grades. As an example, my mentor indicated something I had produced was of a professional standard to that of his colleagues, but my grade was marginally above the median. This was consistent across a number of my projects, to the point I decided I could do no worse by not engaging my mentor. So, for my final project I decided to go it alone. The result? My best grade, by a significant margin. If that doesn't confirm the mentoring is useless, I don't know what does. To this day I'm still waiting on more detailed feedback.\nNow onto the big reason I enrolled in the course... the industry connections, the promise to do everything the company can do get you a job and help kickstart a career in Software Development...\nLet me first preface this by stating I come from a professional background. I did not undertake this role to start a new career because of salary. I did it because it's something I've always loved. I will be taking a big pay cut to do so. My career thus far is what would be considered fairly successful, it's just something I'm no longer interested in.\nSo, onto the career’s module and assistance. I completed the course in April 2020, ‘graduated’ in May 2020. Since then, I’ve had one call with the careers team. Despite my numerous attempts and emails confirming we will have follow-up calls, I'm still waiting. To be precise it's been over 6 weeks since the first call. The careers module is also mostly linking to YouTube videos that are available for free. If you’re expecting content specifically created for this course, this is not the case. \nIn the first call I was asked to gather some information, which I invested a good bit of my time doing. I've created multiple CV's and Cover Letters and sent them on. The response? Nada. That's right, nothing. I've had zero feedback. I've had zero from the career’s ‘team’. Even the first call I had was cancelled last minute (7 minutes before) and rescheduled. The second time the Code Institute career's director was 15 minutes late. Terrible experience.\nWhere does that leave me today? I'm still trying to find a job myself. I'm actually considering enrolling in a Masters degree and taking on more debt because to be honest the bootcamp, as it stands, has been a waste of time. Everything (and more) could be learned from freeCodeCamp for FREE. The add-ons such as mentoring and careers have had zero value, and in the case of mentoring, I would argue negative value as they set me up for a fall.",

        "review": "A bit of background: former aviation professional with 18 years of work experience.\nFor two years I had contemplated a career switch to programming/IT and I first tried to achieve that through various online tutorials. No traction. What I was missing was structure. A detailed study plan and progress tracking. Clear deadlines. Real projects in a real developer environment – including the need to search for solutions myself rather than being handed everything on a plate by just coding along. I have no intention of claiming that everybody needs that to learn – the web is full of testimonials by people who self-taught themselves into successful developer careers. But I did need it, and for those reasons the self-study tutorials didn’t work for me.\nWhat really “sold” me for the Code Institute course – even in comparison with other similar courses I had looked at – were these promises:\n-\ta university-credited diploma upon successful completion of the course\n-\ta curriculum built upon technologies in high demand by the industry,\n-\tfour-pillar in-course support (Student Care, Tutors, personal Mentor, Slack community)\n-\tcareer support upon course completion.\nThe price of EUR 5500 was not negligible by any stretch, but once I had made the final decision to change careers, and comparing the above promises to other courses of similar content/scope and their prices, it was more than reasonable.\nIt took me 7 months to complete the course, and after these 7 months I can say that my experience has been OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE.  As far as I’m concerned, Code Institute has made good on every single promise they had made before the course, and then some. Without going into too much detail, Student Care (checking in on me via telephone every 6 weeks or so) and Tutor Support (available 0-24h on weekdays and 9am-5pm on weekends for any course-related question and beyond) were absolutely stellar, and the Slack community (consisting of students, alumni and some of the mentors) is incredibly friendly and supportive - I have received amazing support in the channels and made some really good friends along the way. Career support (CV/Cover Letter/LinkedIn profile tailoring advice, employer engagement) has also exceeded my expectations.\nCould the course contents be improved? Of course. There is a student feedback form at the end of every module, and the course is undergoing constant improvements – just as an example, around the time I started, they changed the “official” course IDE to replace an outdated one, and around the time I was finishing, the Django module was fully remade to use Django 3, and is IMHO currently the best module in the course.  Minor bugs or problems (which can also be reported through Slack) are usually resolved (or at least worked around) within hours or days at most. \nCould there be more content? Maybe, but I think the notion of  a complete “full stack” is more than well covered with the current content: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Materialize, MySQL, MongoDB, Python, Flask, Django. I'm more than happy with the scope this course has given me, and I think I'm well-equipped to start on any path I choose, be it Frontend, Backend or Full-Stack Dev.\nYou will hear some people complain that there is too much self-study and outside research required, that for this price you shouldn’t need to do that. I disagree. Yes, some individual research is needed. But I say with full confidence that there is no obstacle that the course puts in front of the student that couldn’t be overcome using own efforts, Google, Tutor Support, and Slack – at least I haven’t encountered one. And I really appreciate the moments when I was forced to do some own “digging”, as these have taught me the invaluable skill of looking for solutions, asking questions and Googling properly – I know that all this sounds like a joke, but if you’ve ever talked to a programmer, you’ll know it isn’t. I’m glad I wasn’t handed all the answers on a silver platter – I truly believe it has made me a better future programmer. \nIs this course appropriate for an ABSOLUTE novice, e.g. for someone who has never used the word “variable” or doesn’t know the difference between an OS and a browser? Honestly, I don’t have a good answer to that question. I think that at least being comfortable with using a computer – that is, for more than Netflix and Wikipedia - is a prerequisite for a comfortable study. The modules do cover the fundamentals as deemed required for the subject matter, but if someone has never heard of any of them before, the learning curve may be uncomfortably steep at times and significant additional reading/research may be needed on certain topics.\nFor me, this course was worth every cent and every minute invested and, if I had to choose again, I would choose the same.",

I availed of the \"complimentary lessons\" from each of the half dozen schools comparable to Code Institute, getting a taste of their \"campus,\" so to speak. In a nutshell, most of the schools deliver the same content: you can learn to code with nothing but the internet, if you are resourceful and eager. But what sets Code Institute apart are their platform, their people, and their style. It's totally apparent that Code Institute's online platform has been tried and tested; not a quick scramble in light of the world overhaul on home-based learning -- which was attractive to me. Their tutors are truly invested; their students (my peers) are the most international -- which was important to me. Unlike many of the other schools, Code Institute isn't trying so hard to be anything other than what it is. Advisors, teachers, staff are honest, self-aware, respectable; there's a real \"campus\" experience where you're encouraged to be equally independent and guided. And this was essential to me.",

I don't have a smartphone and didn't have any phone until 2018 when my husband insisted I got something to keep in contact with him when I'm out walking. As a schoolchild in the 1970's, my only contact with anything connected with learning about computers occurred in one mathematics class in 1974, when the newly installed school computer, which was the size of an A3 photocopier, was wheeled into the classroom, along with a table to put the box of paper on that scrolled through it,  and we participated in writing programme instructions to land a small spaceship.  We all took our turn at the keyboard to input values to control the rate of descent of our craft and we all succeeded in crashing spectacularly and killing all the occupants!! No happy press conference for us!\nMy next brush with technology came in 1992. There was a computer in the house and my husband had few problems understanding how to do things and if he was perplexed he would contact my brother in law who was a boffin and worked at British Telecom.My computer usage has always been on a need to know basis.  I decided that I should show some interest in technology as that could allow me to broaden the scope of my career. I worked in the Post Office and they had just introduced computers onto the counter albeit nothing to do with 'Windows', just an in house accounting package for balancing our tills. I enrolled in a night class but after two weeks I realised that a 'beginners' class still assumed that you had an understanding of language and concept around computers. The teacher thought it was 'quaint' that I was taking notes and asked if I had a bad memory! \"You can always go and look at what you've done before!\", he said.  \"But if I don't know why or how I did it , it wont necessarily make sense for the future\", I replied. He looked nonplussed, I didn't go back.  \nI send and receive emails, I use Facebook to play games and keep in touch with family and friends, I can get onto the bank website to check if something has arrived or left my account, I can usually manage to order something from a website but don't shop online very often and with the help of my son I managed to join in with a virtual choir during the recent lockdown.  \nThe reason for this life history is to illustrate the fact that many courses, online and in person, assume that the student has some concept and language familiarity for the subject they are beginning to learn. Any course that advertises itself as an introduction or taster would be well advised to consider that among the students are a percentage of subject virgins whose knowledge only extends to being able to spell the subject title.  I find it more and more common these days that I have to learn how to do things on the computer because the world has begun to think that everyone knows how to and nobody wants to do anything any other way. \nRegarding the challenge, I would suggest a short intro in the Module, or a little more in Billy's intro email, to explain the overall process that the student will be taking part in, i.e that certain set-up elements of the page being created will already be in place and that each day they will be adding to the content. Also a statement at some point that lets the student know that they have finished all the content each day. My opinion on the institute website is probably clouded by my dislike of most websites as they have too many buttons and sections which confuses me. My best day on the course was Day 4.  The videos were good.  Someone could say that I was only copying what was done on the video. My response would be that the medium of seeing something done is how I learn best. Being able to go back to the video to take in a process several times served me well.  However, the script alongside was BRUTAL!  No punctuation is a no-no. \nOverall I did enjoy the challenge and I may continue to learn coding but not online. Thank you.",

The instructor was clear and precise, and the hands-on worked perfectly as illustration of the theory.  I know this is on an introductory level, but I wish a little more about JavaScript.  The instructor said that good programmers are lazy and reuse.  This could easily have been demonstrated in the last exercise, where it would suffice with two functions instead of four: hover(\"section id\") and leave(\"section id\") - a simple demonstration of parameters.\nBut this is just a detail.  I have no problems recommending this course as an introduction.",

Being suddenly retrenched and  unemployed from a 17 year career due to Covid I decided to teach myself how to build a simple website for a business idea... and it was through this that I first noticed the html section in Joomla. Coincidentally an ad popped up on FB and I clicked it.... next thing I knew, I was taking part in the Code Institute's 5-Day Challenge. \nWhat started with an apprehensive and fearful leap into the unknown, quickly built into an excitement, and the satisfaction of completing daily challenges daily became quite addictive. The only negative point of the challenges in when the sessions ended! The challenge is overall genius as it forces you to think for yourself, while still guiding you through each module. A huge thank you to Billy and Luca for their guidance during the challenge.\nI left this course inexplicably fired up with a new-found avenue, which I can, with crisp-clarity, seeing myself immersed in as a career. I am already on the next steps looking into the Diploma in Software Development.. which a week ago I would honestly have never considered in my wildest dreams.",

It is based on submitting projects rather than doing an online examination, which in my opinion is more efficient. Bottom line, it is a career-based and accredited diploma and I fully recommend to anyone to enroll at their courses and become part of it... It is a win-win  !!!",

There were definitely Milestones that were difficult to reach, and prioritising the workload against work etc takes a lot of dedication. Outcomes?

        "review": "I went through the 5 Day Coding Challenge offered by Code Institute, advertised by the motto 'Is Coding the Right Career for You?'\nActually, the name of the challenge is way too broad and pretty misleading because it doesn't dwell on any of the coding fundamentals such as algorithms, functions, objects, etc. -- at all! Instead, it is only focused on HMTL (80%) and CSS (20%) + offers a tiniest example of JavaScript use = Front End only. A fair name for the challenge should be 5 Day Simple Web Page Creation Challenge. Do you feel the difference? Does this sound engaging in 2020? Hardly.\nThen, even for the topic of web page creation, the challenge is somewhat shallow and not challenging enough (a crime for a challenge!) Personally, I haven't learned almost anything new compared to what I knew already back in 2005.\nThe interfaces Code Institute uses for teaching are quite intuitive and rather user-friendly, but still, I see some room for improvement. The videos are mostly too slow and monotonous; the 'enthusiastic' background music distracts a bit; the transcripts are not split into sentences. Then, the instructions for the exercises are too detailed for a challenge! People can memorize things this way, but will they learn them properly? To learn things, trial-and-error method is unavoidable -- but here, almost no room for an error is left!\nMy verdict: this taster course may be good either for young teens or for some people who are the direct opposite of tech-savvy. But then, what can they learn from here? Not much at all, to my mind. And worse is the fact that it doesn't make me wanna learn more using Code Institute since I don't think a paid course by CI will be considerably deeper.",

It would have been helpful to get a bit more information to grasp why something does what and where the commands come from. I found myself going back and forth to the videos to examine the code in the examples to figure things out, which isn't bad in itself, but I felt like I needed to know and understand more.

The exercises were easily broken down to understandable chunks, and the interactive platform to test them out and work through the problems finding a solution was a great touch.\nThe setup of the challenge is simple and easy enough: each learning element is available to work at your own pace (shouldn't take more than 30-60 minutes each day) and you are also (optionally) enrolled into a forum where others are also completing the challenge. So you can communicate and share ideas/problem solving methods, or ask for help if you're stuck. This forum is also monitored by a very engaging Admin from Code Institute who proved to be a big help to many people.\nIf, like me, you have any experience with HTML at all before you begin, you will see that the first day is relatively easy and straightforward, and the challenges shouldn't take too long. As the days go on, complexity increases and new elements are introduced.\nThe most enjoyable, and valuable, thing I took away from this challenge, personally, is the fact that every step is thoroughly explained, so not only are you learning the technical \"what do to\", but also the \"why you are doing this\". It really helped build on my previous surface-level understanding of CSS.",

There is a supportive community available via Slack - comprising of other students, tutors, and mentors. The course itself includes text lessons and videos. The videos demonstrate how to use the language and provide mini projects you can set up yourself as you follow along. There are 4 Milestone projects that you have to complete, and the real learning happens while you are working on these. As mentioned above, there's plenty of support to help you get over the rough spots and reach your goal. Most importantly the Code Institute values feedback from students and continuously works to improve its course content.\nStudents are kept informed of Events that may be of help to them and are given Career Support as they strive to find roles to match their new skills.\nCons:\nI felt the JavaScript, dc, d3, and API videos were a bit difficult to grasp, and that they were missing basic foundation information that someone with no previous exposure to them would grasp on their own. This made the projects built using these a bit more daunting. JavaScript is not the same as other programming languages and I think it would help to have an initial video explaining the differences - e.g. assigning variables by reference, asynchronous behavior. As regards dc, d3 and APIs, again I think the videos need to start with more basic information explaining the concepts involved.",

Also, sometimes there seems to be a glitch which doesn't allow for the test to be passed even though it was correctly coded (after several attempts of running the test and getting failed results I copied the coding and reset the workspace and pasted it in again- then all of a sudden it worked). Another thing I think could be improved is the order of the run -test posts when you check if you have passed the various coding tests for one challenge- they are not in the order of how they are presented in the instructions from the teacher- if it would have been, it would be even more pedagogical! But otherwise, I can really recommend this mini course for someone who wants to try out coding! Thank you, Code Institute :)",

Code Institute has developed a perfect and modern online learning environment, very visual with the help of videos, followed by very pedagogical tests that makes sure you learn stuff in the right order, you can tell alot of thought went into designing the tests and they aren't ridiculously easy as with some other similar courses, some requires you (by design) to google and struggle a bit, which allmost immediately puts you in the shoes of a real programmer, and getting to a logical conclusion of what code to use all by yourself is very rewarding and really makes you get it and learn, and want to learn more, and more, AND MORE!! :) The fun environment and chatroom with students and teachers keeps you engaged. I'm not very good with words, especially English ones, but I can't recommend Code Institute highly enough.",

The content of the challenge covers basics of HTML, Css & JavaScript, or as they put it \"The three pillars of modern web development\". So, in this 5 day challenge, you'll learn the basics of HTML, Css & and JavaScript which will allow you to build simple web sites and give you a pretty good foundation to move on from there, and start asking more advanced questions and build more complex sites. Basically, it's like someone took you 25,000 years back in time where he showed you a tribe of hunter-gatherers and explained you the constitution of that tribe, it's culture and the dynamics of the interaction of its members so you end up feeling that you could become a pretty decent paleontologist and historian if you continue pursuing that path.

The videos were followed by \"challenges\", often straightforward applications of what we just learned. Upon completion of the fifth day, we had built a responsive webpage.\nThe content appealed to me as carefully crafted: the authors obviously took time to make the videos as short and relevant as possible, focussing on the most essential tags and attributes. The online code editor used for the exercises was very suited for online learning. \nHaving been exposed to a great deal of this material a few years ago, I was not a total beginner. The 5DCC worked as a welcome refresher, not only of the syntax, but of the sheer pleasure of creating a webpage. Responsiveness was new for me; I had always assumed it required advanced skills. As it happens, CSS handles it beautifully. \nThe 5DCC may be for you if you're not a total beginner. The threshold is quite low, though: if you understand that a webpage is basically just plain text interpreted by a browser, you're good to go.\nAlso, keep in mind that the 5DCC is an introduction. If you developed a website (even a simple one) in the recent past, you're probably too advanced for the material covered.\nThe part on Javascript was particularly brief. In the course, Javascript is used to create a simple animation that -the authors confide- can be achieved with CSS in a more elegant way. I wish they had dispensed of the Javascript section altogether and delved deeper into CSS.\nOverall, the 5DCC was a pleasant experience, carried through in a professionnal manner, and requiring little time on the student's part.\nBe aware that it also acts as a promotional product, similar to an open day at the university: the goal is to introduce potential students to what the institution has to offer.",

In my opinion it was a fun and well structured module, but the person that explains the concepts in the videos/narrates them made a bit too many mistakes or was stuttering a bit too much in my opinion also the transcript (which can be helpful if you don't understand what the narrator is saying because of a local acccent) sometimes was just plain off. The point of offering such a free challenge/module is to recruit new people into your paid programme and therefore to present yourself at your best, but like I explained before this didn't feel like Code Institute being at its best (it's a free module, so can't complain too much really). In the end I just want to say that this challenge didn't convince me to join one of their paid programs and the \"quality\" of the free module did contribute to that although I really wouldn't have had enough time nor money since I'm studying at university at the moment.",

And the first piece of code I’d ever written was two years ago.\nI’ve never been a ‘computer person.’ I was good at maths at school (logical/good at problem solving), but never thought I’d ever be into programming. About two years ago I thought I’d give it a go, and really enjoyed it! When I realised I wanted a career in web development, I thought I should probably do a proper course in it (arguably not necessary, but an awful lot easier).\nAfter coming across this diploma, an initial phone call where I confirmed my interest and then going through the sign up process, I started. I was gently eased into the course, both in terms of the course content and pace but also in terms of having a mentor assigned to me to help me out with my coursework - Jim was a crucial part of each piece of coursework.\nAs the course got more tricky, I realised the importance and necessity of self-motivation and perseverance - those qualities are a big part of what got me through the course. Do bear that in mind.\nThe tutor service was also a big part of getting me through the challenges of web development - they’re quick to respond (within their working hours of course), yet without spoon-feeding you the answer.\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this course. It’s no easy course - the qualification, a Diploma in Software Development, as I understand it is equivalent to completing the first two years of university. But the support was great and as I say, I’ve got a job now - the course fulfilled its purpose perfectly!",

I don’t believe that my application really had to be approved, nor my payment plan. Even though the guy I have been corresponding with throughout had been very nice  (also nice that it was the same guy all the time, so it felt more personal) but telling me “great news!  I have been approved or that my payment plan had been approved, was a bit of a cheek.(I know it was not him, but what he was taught to do)  At the end of the day, Code Institute is a business selling a product, and I’m pretty sure not too many get turned down to getting a course link in return for 5-7 thousand euros!

The coursework was simple enough because video tutorials gave you step by step instructions to build each of your projects. I built 24 different mini projects in a variety of languages starting with the basics of html and css then quickly elevating to javascript and python using flask and django.\nTo challenge myself I also started each new project using a different IDE and would recommend you do the same. Setting up the environment for your project is a skill in itself and using different IDE's to launch the projects helps your understanding of the fundamentals a bit more though it does add additional time (and frustration) to the process.\nOverall, I give the course a big thumbs up. There is substantial support for all through the tutor and mentor tabs so you have a friendly resource to turn to when you get stuck.\nHappy days ;-)",

However, what I soon discovered was a wealth of in-depth learning materials which covered a variety of quintessential industry-relevant technologies and more. \nThe student support team are fast, friendly and approachable, respond to all questions and queries and always offer a solution, whether by concisely reiterating information or having additional guided support delivered on a one-to-one basis.\nSometimes, I found the course to be hard, no doubt, but good things rarely ever come easy anyway, which I had to accept. However, because of just how good the online student and mentor community interaction is, I never felt alone. Support from brilliant people was only ever one message away. \nI was able to complete the programme working on a part-time basis while I continued with my regular day job without any problems.

The videos are easy to follow, and supply ample documentation of the source code. You'll have several mini-challenges to tackle, and 4 large Milestone projects to build, which ultimately become your personal portfolio! We have an large #slack community with people across the globe, where you can ask questions for support. There's also a Tutor Support team for more in-depth queries or tougher issues you may come up against. In addition, throughout the course you're also paired with a mentor that you'll have constant communication with from the beginning to the end of each of your milestone projects.\nObviously there are other courses out there, all with their own pros and cons - some of which I've done myself - but I can say for a fact (from my First Class Honors diploma!) that the Code Institute Software Development course is something you need to do if you'd like to become a Full-Stack Developer!",

Nun im Cloud track, gibt es 60 min Intro session pro Woche und der Rest ist eine checkliste die abgearbeitet werden soll..Das Lernmaterial ist ein udemy kurs der meistens 12 euro kostet und links zu Youtube Videos sowie ein Lernspiel von Amazon.. Was zum Fuck.. Ich habe eine liebe SSM, die sich Mühe gibt aber ich bin Maßlos enttäuscht und werde das Gefühl nicht los dass hier nur ein weiteres Unternehmen staatliche Förderung abgreift. Beim rekrutieren ist das Bild einer Schule gezeichnet worden. Das hat sich in der Praxis nicht bestätigt . Für Menschen ohne Vorerfahrung in diesen Bereichen( WAS ABER GENAU SO BEWORBEN WIRD) ist das Programm überhaupt nicht geeignet. im zweiten Monat gab es bereits einen Hackathon bei dem eine API benutzt werden sollte, das Lernmodul dazu kommt aber erst im 5 Monat ...LOL.  In boot camps ist das pensum traditionell überwältigt, aber dieses ist sein Geld nicht wert. Meiner Meinung nach gehört Masterschool die Lizenz entzogen, zumindest für den Clod track. Die Lehrer und Mentoren empfehlen statt den Lehrern erstmal anderen Teilnehmerinnen ihre Fragen zu stellen. Einerseits verstehe ich den Sinn dahinter anderseits kommt es in Kombination mit der dünnen Betreuung rüber als würden sie einen abwimmeln. In den Sessions ist keine Zeit zum Fragen, auch komplexe themen werden nicht ausreichend behandelt und es wird nur rübergewischt und dann direkt zum nächsten Thema gesprungen. Ich habe zudem festgestellt das teilweise ganze Absätze aus dem Lernmaterial 1:1 bei kostenlosen Websites zu finden sind... Nochmal Wo bitte sind 47Tsd Euro da legitimiert ? Dann kommen noch technische Probleme hinzu die m.E bei einer \"IT-school\" nicht vorkommen sollten. Ich hätte noch mehr Kritikpunkte, aber das hier reicht hoffentlich um dem Abraten von dieser Institution zu begründen..

Als Quereinsteigerin aus dem kaufmännischen Bereich war mein Einstieg in die Welt des Programmierens eine echte Herausforderung. Der Umgang mit Python, GitHub, logischem und analytischem Denken sowie das Zerlegen komplexer Aufgaben in kleine programmierbare Schritte fühlte sich zunächst wie ein steiler Berg an.\nBesonders zu Beginn waren die vielen neuen Begriffe und Konzepte schwer zu greifen – oft fehlte mir der Gesamtzusammenhang. Das hat meine Entwicklung zwar verlangsamt und viel Energie gekostet, doch mit der Zeit hat sich alles gefügt. Heute, neun Monate später, blicke ich mit Zufriedenheit und großer Freude auf meine Entscheidung zurück, diesen Weg gegangen zu sein.\nWas mir besonders geholfen hat, war die großartige Unterstützung durch das Team: Manuela, Rawi, Thomas, Suzan und Riccardo standen mir mit Geduld, Motivation und verständlichen Erklärungen wirklich täglich zur Seite. Ohne sie hätte ich viele Hürden nicht überwinden können.\nDas Vollzeit-Programm ist zudem sehr familienfreundlich. Es wird Rücksicht darauf genommen, wenn man für einzelne Aufgaben mehr Zeit benötigt. Auch der Austausch mit anderen Studierenden macht das Lernen lebendig, motivierend und einfach schön.\nNach sechs Monaten intensiven Lernens mit Python habe ich mich für den Cloud-Track entschieden – und bin begeistert. Die Aufgaben machen Spaß und geben einem das Gefühl, tatsächlich eine Programmiererin zu sein. Diese Weiterbildung hat mir die Tür zur IT-Welt geöffnet. Es gibt noch so viel zu entdecken und zu lernen, und ich freue mich darauf, diesen Weg weiterzugehen.\nEin Hinweis für andere Teilnehmende: Auch wenn der Kurs auf Deutsch ist, sind viele Aufgaben auf Englisch. Es ist daher hilfreich, zumindest Grundkenntnisse in der englischen Sprache mitzubringen.\nIch kann Masterschool jedem empfehlen, der bereit ist, sich neuen Herausforderungen zu stellen und sich weiterzuentwickeln. Es lohnt sich!",

Masterschool helped me exactly with that.\nI gained more practice, experience, and confidence. Being part of a group with shared goals helped me feel less alone, and direct contact with industry experts gave me real insight into the role. Technically, Masterschool did a good job, and I personally think they could do even better if they raised their standards in delivering the material. I believe they can become a leader in the industry.\nCareer advisors and support were the best parts. They were consistently helpful, truly listened, and gave guidance that made a real difference. They understood my challenges and helped me improve.\nOverall, Masterschool’s support kept me focused and confident. For a successful career change, technical skills are important — but so is believing in yourself. When the interviewer can sense that confidence, it makes a real difference. Masterschool helped me rebuild that belief.",

Karina hat sich stets Zeit genommen, um meine Fragen zu beantworten und hat mir durch wertvolle Tipps und gezielte Vorbereitungsgespräche geholfen, meine Chancen auf den Bildungsgutschein erheblich zu steigern.\nBesonders beeindruckt hat mich ihre Erreichbarkeit – sie hat sogar angeboten, während meines Termins beim Jobcenter telefonisch Unterstützung zu leisten. Diese außergewöhnliche Hilfsbereitschaft und ihr Engagement haben mir sehr viel Sicherheit gegeben.\nDank ihrer Unterstützung konnte ich den Antrag erfolgreich stellen und fühle mich bestens auf meinen weiteren Weg vorbereitet. Ich bin äußerst zufrieden und kann Karina sowie die Masterschool jedem weiterempfehlen, der eine kompetente und engagierte Begleitung auf dem Bildungsweg sucht.\nVielen Dank, Karina, für deine exzellente Unterstützung und deine positive Art!",

Was Berater halt so tun :D\nMeine Fragen zu den Kursen wurden schnell und freundlich beantwortet, benötigte Unterlagen um ggf. den Kurs anzumelden beim Jobcenter hatte ich innerhalb von Minuten im Postfach, auch wie ich im Falle des Falles hätte agieren müssen hat er mir erklärt und mich mit allem versorgt was ich gebraucht hätte um mich anzumelden. \nDer Kontakt lief teils per Whatsapp und teils per Email ab, wobei ich Whatsapp halt als angenehm persönlich empfunden habe. So wartet man mit seinen Fragen nicht tagelang auf eine Antwort-Email oder vergisst sie sogar (oder vlt passiert auch nur mir sowas ^^)\nAlles in Allem war ich sehr zufrieden und werde auch wie gesagt noch mindestens am Grundkurs zur Orientierung teilnehmen, allerdings erst wenn es meine Zeit wieder zulässt.",

Also dachte ich mir, schau doch mal rein.\nJust for fun habe ich mich beworben und dachte, auf gut Glück wird es was, oder nicht. Und es wurde mehr als das.\nSchon kurze Zeit später kontaktierte mich ein Personal Manager und riet mir zum Einsteigerkurs. Der geht einen Monat und ist ein kurzer Einblick in die 3 großen Bereiche, die Masterschool anbietet - Software Engineering, Cybersicherheit und Datenanalyse.\nDer Start war ein bisschen holprig, weil ich weder gesponserten Laptop, noch irgendwelche Startdaten hatte, aber beim Nachfragen und erkundigen zwischen dem Personal Couch und mir, verlief doch noch alles glatt. Auch unser Dozent war ein sehr freundlicher Mann. Er hat alles gut erklärt, auch verständlich anschaulich gemacht und hatte auch ein Ohr für meine privaten Schwierigkeiten.\nMan hat einfach rundum gemerkt, das Masterschool (obwohl es hier nur ein einmonatiger Orientierungskurs war) wollte, dass du bestehst und dich wohl fühlst. Ich kann es daher nur weiter empfehlen!",

Therefore, someone who has no experience in this field will definitely not be able to find a job and all that money will be wasted. But their teachers are very polite and very caring. They are well-working employees of their own institutions",

You can tell that the team behind it is genuinely trying their best to create a program that caters to everyone’s needs while constantly striving for improvement on all levels.\nI had a positive experience and felt like I learned a lot. There was a clear timeframe for completing tasks, which made me feel like I was part of a structured process. However, it’s important to note that self-learning is a crucial aspect of programs like this and will take up the majority of your time. I’m not sure if other programs operate differently, but this seems to be the standard approach.\nEngaging in online education requires self-discipline, motivation, and a genuine desire to learn. Nobody will hold your hand and explain things step by step as if teaching children. This is something many people seemed disappointed by.\nOf course, there were areas for improvement—perhaps more recap sessions or a better mentor in my case. That said, there were excellent mentors available, and many participants were genuinely grateful for them. Overall, Masterschool was a solid platform. I could rely on receiving officially recognised certifications, a laptop to complete my studies (which I kept afterward), 24/7 support for questions, access to platforms, daily sessions and other resources. \nI’m happy with my experience at Masterschool. It opened the door to a career in Cybersecurity, showed me where to learn, and introduced me to the tools I need to continue on this path independently.",

        "review": "After many successful years in online marketing, I decided in 2024 to expand my career into Data Analytics & Business Intelligence. Data has always been a part of my work, but I wanted to take the bold step of making it the core of my profession. I compared several educational programs but ultimately chose Masterschool. Their significantly longer program duration (7 months), the diverse topics, and the practical projects convinced me more than the typical 12-week courses.\nThroughout my studies, I had the opportunity to work with professional instructors who explained even complex topics in an understandable way. Special thanks go to our SQL instructor, Thimo, who has an exceptional ability to make intricate concepts easy to grasp. Without him, my SQL skills wouldn't be where they are today. I’m equally grateful to Zerihun, who took on the challenge of teaching the fundamentals of Tableau and dashboard design clearly and engagingly within a short time.\nThe course content was perfectly tailored to real-world business demands. Core areas included scripting languages like SQL, Python, and Pandas, BI & Data Visualization, and database management. Through three hands-on projects—both in teams and individually—we tackled larger data challenges, wrote complex code, and always benefited from Masterschool’s immense support. Masterschool’s course content on its own learning platform for Python, SQL, and all project-related topics was excellent, with weekly challenges and quizzes setting the pace and measuring learning progress. Every day included live sessions and self-directed learning. The digital campus homepage made it easy to navigate your own learning journey, offering full-service support, recordings and documentation of all sessions, helpful resources, and access to various partner websites like DataCamp and Coursera. \nA special highlight was the mentoring program. Tatyana Godunova consistently supported me throughout this demanding journey, both mentally and professionally. She encouraged me to stay focused, go the extra mile, and never give up. She was always available for technical questions, and her lectures—along with those by Thimo, Zerihun, and Stavros—were among the best.\nMasterschool also actively supported my career development. Career Coach Fareen Shaikh prepared us through intensive sessions on imposter syndrome, CV and LinkedIn optimization, motivation letter writing, job searching, and interview preparation. We also benefited from mock interviews and valuable feedback from various career instructors during our job readiness phase. Even after completing the program, I was supported by Abigail Fried, a professional Career Advisor from Masterschool. She provided me with valuable feedback on my applications, helped me set weekly goals, and continuously encouraged me during the challenging job search process.\nAnyone considering the Data Analytics program at Masterschool should be aware that it requires a high level of commitment, self-initiative, and engagement to successfully complete the course and tackle the subsequent challenge of job hunting. The course content is intensive and compact, and depending on the topic, it’s essential to independently deepen your knowledge—especially in tools like Tableau—to build a truly solid foundation.\nSince the job market is saturated with many Data Analytics bootcamp graduates, it's important to choose a focus area early on, expand your expertise, and work on additional projects to strengthen your portfolio.\nOverall, Masterschool was an experience I wouldn’t want to miss—and it ultimately helped me land my first job in Data Analytics.\n*Please note that I was part of the last cohort of the 7-month training program, which has now been extended to a 14-month program in Germany.",

They ranged from online labs for gaining practical experience, to online lessons that were presented by Cyber Security experts and SMEs. The quality of learning resources is top-notch, and I am still blown away that I had (and still have) constant access to all of them.\nI am neurodiverse (I have ADHD and OCD), and I found that the twice weekly, two hour online classes were too easily disrupted or interrupted by other students. The many times that this happened, I found it really hard to keep concentrating and I lost the ability to focus again, causing me intense feelings of overwhelm. I therefore had to make the decision to complete the course without the help of the real time classes. This in itself made the whole learning experience  very  challenging for me, as I was effectively having to teach myself so much; not an ideal situation for people with ADHD. Having said that, it only affected me due to my neurospiciness; I am posting about it so that other neurodiverse people are able to get an overarching view, from my experience.\nI also had 24/7 access to a chat facility on the Masterschool website though, so if I had any issues, or if I did not understand something, I was able to seek advice and help from a pool of on-hand Masterschool experts. Although this is in itself a brilliant resource, it is not a sufficient enough classroom substitute. I did explain in one of my weekly feedback forms as to why I wasn't joining the classes with my fellow classmates, however my comments were never followed up with me by anyone.\nI sincerely hope that Masterschool will implement adaptations that would benefit neurodiverse students so much. I have to say though, that my Career Success Advisor (CSA) Yael really does help me as much as she can. She can tell on our calls how I am, and she helps me navigate areas in which I struggle. \nMasterschool has enabled me to progress my learning and to elevate my career opportunities; I therefore fully recommend them to anyone who wants to better themselves, their lives, or their job.\n*Edit* \nI had a follow up call with Maayan from the UX team at Masterschool today; she genuinely and passionately wanted to know about my learning experience in more depth. Maayan took on board all of my feedback, and the call was incredibly constructive and informative, in both directions. I truly feel that my feedback as someone with ADHD was taken on board, and I am confident that Masterschool will introduce adjustments for people who may need them. Thank you Maayan. \nIn summary, I recommend Masterschool to everyone who wants to better themselves at a globally recognised level. I also fully recommend this learning platform to neurodiverse people who are not sure if this learning format will work for them. I was not sure it would work for me, but I took the chance and I have come out with a technical qualification...all thanks to Masterschool.",

And I can feel with their support that it will happen. \nThe school has good Mentors, the structure of the classes are good and the job related certificates prepare you for your future. \nIn the end it will always be dependent on the student on how much work you are willing to put in that will determine your success, but the good thing with Masterschool is that they have a system to support you and guide you through this journey",

From day one, Masterschool delivered exactly that, making me feel supported and valued every step of the way.\nIn addition to the technical training, Masterschool provided a range of resources to prepare us for the challenges of entering a new field. The variety of communication channels, like Slack, Bubble Chat, and access to mentors, ensured help was always available when I needed it. I particularly appreciated having a dedicated mentor who met with me weekly and provided instant support whenever I faced challenges.  \nThe sense of community was another highlight. Engaging with peers who shared similar goals through Slack created a strong network of support. Transitioning to a new career can be scary, but knowing I wasn’t alone in this journey gave me confidence and encouragement.\nThe career counseling in the final month of technical training, followed by the Career Accelerator Program, demonstrated Masterschool’s professionalism and commitment. These sessions equipped us with the tools and guidance to navigate the job search process in an unfamiliar field. \n \nIn summary, Masterschool has been instrumental in my journey, offering personalized support, an encouraging community, and high-quality training. My biggest takeaways are the quick feedback on questions, the sense of belonging, and the exceptional training from experienced lecturers.",

For me, what makes this school stand out is how the material is delivered: through clear and engaging videos recorded by field experts, live sessions, Campus as a platform packed with resources, just to name the most important ones. The support from instructors, schoolmasters, mentors, and peers has been invaluable, creating an environment where you never feel alone, especially when tackling tough topics.\nThe Career Hub is another standout feature. After graduation, it becomes your central tool for job hunting, offering everything from a resource library and resume builder to prep platforms and your own dedicated career advisor.\nThat said, here’s my honest advice: a deep interest in the subject is your place of power. It’s what will sustain you when things get overwhelming or when you feel like you’re not progressing as you hoped. If you’re making a career switch without any background in maths, statistics, or programming prepare to work not just hard, but hard³.",

        "review": "When I started at Masterschool, the Cybersecurity course was completely new for Germany, and definitely had its bumps and obstacles. I choose to start at Masterschool because it seemed like the best bootcamp experience available. To this day I still think it is. \nI initially thought of not giving 5 stars, as there has been certain unfulfilled promises (even though they were in written format), sugar-coated realities and sometimes a decent lack of structure to the course. \nHowever, after ending the bootcamp, Masterschool has truly stepped up, and compensated for the bumpy road with extremely good follow-ups, dedication to help me land a job, extended access to learning platforms, constant check-ins to help me stay motivated in my job search, all while giving me the feeling they truly care about helping me with my career.  \nAgain, our cohort was the first Cybersecurity cohort in Germany, and Masterschool seem to truly focus on constant improvement. I therefore believe anyone starting their Cybersecurity course at this point, will have a much smoother and tailored experience.\nAll of this dedication and willingness to help beyond the scope of the bootcamp makes Masterschool deserve a full 5 star review. \nThat said, it should be said that the amount of personal investment in terms of time, passion and dedication from my side has been absolutely necessary. I am not exaggerating when I say I've spend 10-14 hours every single day, weekends included to get to the point where I am today, and I still feel humbled by how beautifully complex the field of Cybersecurity is. If you expect to join Masterschool, and sit back and relax while a career is handed to you, you might as well choose a different career. You truly need to take ownership over your own career and journey, and if you do, Masterschool will 100% have your back, and support you until you land that job. If you don't, then there is only so much they can do anyway. \nOverall, I would absolutely recommend this bootcamp if backed by a Gutschein from the Arbeitsamt. And if you do decide to start this journey - best of luck, and keep pushing! :)",

        "review": "Bewertung der Masterschool - 05. Dezember 2024\nLeider kann ich mich überhaupt nicht mit dem angebotenen Programm an der Masterschool anfreunden. Es wird kaum auf die tatsächlichen Probleme eingegangen, und das Lernkonzept hinterlässt viele Fragen. Zu Beginn hat man nur zwei Live-Sessions pro Tag, jeweils mit einer Stunde Dauer. In jeder dieser Stunden wird ein neues Thema behandelt, ohne dass genügend Zeit bleibt, um das Gelernte wirklich zu verstehen und zu verinnerlichen. Es fühlt sich an, als ob das hauptsächliche Ziel darin besteht, die monatlichen Zahlungen zu sichern, während die Qualität der Lehre eher nebensächlich erscheint.\nDas Programm ist sehr theoretisch, und es wird nicht ausreichend erklärt, wie und wo man das Wissen in der Praxis anwenden soll. Nach 12 Monaten soll man zwei Monate in die Praxis gehen, aber da einem nicht gezeigt wird, wie man das Gelernte konkret anwendet, weiß ich nicht, was ich in der Praxis erwarten soll. Zu Beginn wird zwar nach Grundkenntnissen gefragt, aber im weiteren Verlauf wird man ins kalte Wasser geworfen und behandelt, als hätte man bereits Vorkenntnisse.\nIn der Plattform „TryHackMe“, einem Cybersecurity-Spiel, das für das Hackenlernen genutzt wird, muss man Aufgaben erledigen, ohne dass die Einführungsaufgaben wirklich behandelt werden. Das führt zu einem unzureichenden Verständnis des Materials. Zudem werden Aufgaben, die für 120 Minuten angesetzt sind, innerhalb von 60 Minuten abgearbeitet, was sehr kontraproduktiv ist.\nIch habe das Gefühl, dass den Verantwortlichen bei der Planung der Kurse nicht bewusst ist, was sie tatsächlich den Lernenden zumuten. Würde ich eine Schulnote vergeben, würde Masterschool eine „6“ bekommen.\nDas einzig Positive an der Schule ist, dass ich einen verständnisvollen Mentor habe, der sich Zeit für Fragen nimmt. Leider wird bei den Live-Sessions oft mit der Antwort „Wir haben keine Zeit“ reagiert, und es wird empfohlen, eine zusätzliche Mentorstunde zu buchen. Wenn das der Fall ist, könnte ich theoretisch jeden Tag eine Mentorstunde buchen, was die Probleme nicht wirklich löst.\nAuch der begleitende Englischkurs lässt zu wünschen übrig. Selbst wenn man viele Fehler macht, wird man trotzdem als „bestanden“ eingestuft. Es wäre hilfreich, ein gewisses Englisch-Niveau (mindestens B1) zu haben, um mit dem Kurs klarzukommen.\nEin weiteres großes Problem ist die technische Ausstattung: Den Teilnehmern werden MacBooks mit nur 256 GB SSD und 8 GB RAM zur Verfügung gestellt, die für die Installation von virtuellen Maschinen völlig ungeeignet sind. Am Ende ist der gesamte Speicher fast voll, und die Geräte sind für diese Anforderungen einfach nicht ausgelegt. Laut Apple sind diese MacBooks nicht für derartige Aufgaben konzipiert, während die Instruktoren mit Windows-Rechnern arbeiten.\nWenn man versucht, über diese Probleme mit einem der Instruktoren zu sprechen, wird man leider oft ausgelacht, was den Frust nur noch verstärkt. Anstatt Unterstützung oder konstruktive Kritik zu erhalten, fühlt man sich eher ins Lächerliche gezogen, was die Situation noch unprofessioneller macht.\nZusammenfassend kann ich sagen, dass ich mit der Masterschool sehr unzufrieden bin. Es fehlt an praktischer Anwendung, an einer sinnvollen Struktur und an der notwendigen Unterstützung. Ich bin jedoch bereit, mit der Masterschool über diese schlechte Bewertung zu sprechen, in der Hoffnung, dass sich die Qualität der Ausbildung verbessert.\nMartin",

The learning tools used were all top-notch and fully covered by Masterschool - Making it super easy to just focus on learning and not worry about a large subscription fee. ex: Udemy, ACI learning, Tryhackme and many more. Constructive feedback was always encouraged and I apperciate being heard along the way. Thank you to masterschool for helping me get my Securities + Certification on my first try!\nThings to work on:\nBetter graduation and \"next steps\" process.\nResume website and Projects should be started on day 1 and completed gradually though-out the course\nCareer counslors should be assigned earlier on and keep students accountable on their projects and progress so everyone is more or less moving at the same pace.",

I was going into a field that I wasn't all that familiar with, and in the past, intimidated by. I always thought working in IT, let alone Cyber Security, let alone coding, was out of reach for me because I didn't have the skill set, or the pre-requisite knowledge necessary to succeed. After my experience with Masterschool however, I'm happy to report that my past assumptions were proven wrong. Masterschool's approach to gamifying learning was not only satisfying but deeply rewarding.\nIncorporating sites like tryhackme and ACL learning aided with making concepts that seemed abstract, become real as they made it easier for me to put these ideas into a proper context.\n The fostering of community by utilizing applications like Slack provided a way for myself and other students to not feel alone in our experience, share collaborate in our understanding, and get feedback, not only from other students, but from our professors as well. My favourite moment by far: one afternoon I was reviewing my notes, and the access log that I was reading finally made sense, and I could understand what I was reading. At that moment, it felt as if all this time I was reading in the dark with a flashlight, and then someone flicked the light switch in the room on. Masterschool has given me the confidence to succeed and has helped me understand that no place is too far out, so long as you reach out. Thank you for all your help guys!",

Many years ago I began to feel interested in this profession because it gives freedom and good income. But I had no experience and it seemed terribly impossible to even think that I could program. One day I saw an advertisement for Masterschool and opened it. I liked how unobtrusive they were and how well the information was selected and I just signed up without thinking much. They welcomed me very warmly and with understanding that I had no experience. The mentors are wonderful people and teachers, full of patience and positivity. They did everything possible for me to have no stress and to be able to work calmly. It was a great experience! I, who started from scratch, won two hackathons! The training is top-notch, the mentors' attention to me was 100%. Extremely positive and understanding towards each of us.  We worked on real projects and after completing the course I already had the self-confidence and confidence to start looking for a job and that I would be able to cope. Masterschool opened new horizons in my career and I also found real friends among my colleagues. I am currently developing, working on building various applications and I love my job! I now have my own company and have started to make my dreams come true! I recommend Masterschool if you are still hesitating and lack courage. In this course you will find support and confidence to continue your development! If I had the opportunity, I would continue with retraining and would choose Masterschool again. I still can't believe that in 7 months I am at a high professional level, thanks to them. The training program is so perfect and facilitated! I can't express in words how grateful I am to them! I have a higher education, I have additional courses, but here the training platform is the best I have ever seen! And this is all thanks to the good selection of mentors! The most positive team! The best thing you can do is choose Masterschool! Good luck!",

I appreciated that there is both video material—in which you can increase the playback speed if desired—and a practical part involving code writing. Additionally, at the end of each day, there's a short quiz on the material covered to assess how well it was understood. The course is quite well-structured and organized.

        "review": "Die Masterschool wirbt mit der Möglichkeit, ohne jegliche Vorkenntnisse anspruchsvolle Themengebiete zu erlernen. Doch die Realität zeigt, dass dieses Versprechen für viele Teilnehmende nur schwer einlösbar ist. Die Lernstruktur und die Organisation weisen erhebliche Defizite auf, die den Lernerfolg beeinträchtigen. \nHerausforderungen für Lernende ohne Vorkenntnisse\nFür Personen ohne Vorwissen gestaltet sich der Kurs äußerst schwierig. Die Inhalte sind komplex, und es fehlt an einer klar strukturierten Einführung in die Grundlagen. Statt die Basics („das ABC“) systematisch zu lehren, werden fortgeschrittene Themen („C“) vorangestellt, bevor die eigentlichen Grundlagen („A“ und „B“) vermittelt werden. Dieses chaotische Vorgehen führt dazu, dass viele Teilnehmende den Anschluss verlieren und überfordert sind. \nUnzureichende Betreuung\nEin weiterer Kritikpunkt betrifft die Betreuung durch die Mentoren und Tutoren. Da diese ihren Hauptberuf haben, steht oft wenig Zeit für die Beantwortung von Fragen zur Verfügung. Es kommt vor, dass Lernende mehrere Tage auf Antworten warten müssen. Dies ist besonders frustrierend, wenn man an komplexen Aufgaben arbeitet, die oft in der vorgegebenen Zeit nicht zu bewältigen sind. Einige Aufgaben sind mit zwei Stunden angegeben, während selbst erfahrene Mentoren dafür deutlich länger benötigen würden. Hier wäre es sinnvoll, zusätzliche Ressourcen bereitzustellen, wie beispielsweise fest angestellte Tutoren, die ausschließlich für die Masterschool arbeiten.\nEffizienz der Live-Sitzungen\nDie Live-Sitzungen, die insgesamt etwa sieben Stunden pro Woche umfassen, wirken oft überladen. In den effektiv nutzbaren fünf Stunden werden Themen in einem hohen Tempo vermittelt, was es schwer macht, nachhaltig zu lernen. Zusätzlich zeigt sich, dass viele Lernende gezwungen sind, auf externe Plattformen wie YouTube oder ChatGPT zurückzugreifen, um die Inhalte überhaupt zu verstehen. Dies wirft die Frage auf, warum ein kostenintensiver Kurs nötig ist, wenn das Selbststudium über frei verfügbare Ressourcen häufig effizienter ist.\nUnfaire Lerndynamik\nEin auffälliges Problem ist die unterschiedliche Lernfortschrittsrate innerhalb der Klassen. Erfahrungsberichte zeigen, dass etwa ein Drittel der Teilnehmenden den Stoff relativ schnell versteht, während der Rest wochenlang hinterherhinkt. Dieses Muster ist nicht nur in einzelnen Kursen zu beobachten, sondern zieht sich offenbar durch mehrere Kohorten. Dies zeigt, dass die Lernstruktur nicht auf die Bedürfnisse der Mehrheit der Teilnehmenden zugeschnitten ist.\nVorteile der Masterschool\nTrotz der genannten Herausforderungen gibt es einige Vorteile:  \n1. Flexibilität: Der Kurs kann von zu Hause aus absolviert werden.  \n2. Zugang zu Lernmaterialien:Alle Sitzungen werden aufgezeichnet und sind jederzeit abrufbar.  \n3. MacBook als Anreiz:Auch wenn das Gerät nicht „kostenlos“ ist, sondern im Kurspreis enthalten, wird es als praktisches Werkzeug zur Verfügung gestellt.  \n4. Netzwerk: Viele Teilnehmende berichten von bereichernden Bekanntschaften mit Mitschülerinnen und Mitschülern, die oft hilfreicher sind als die offizielle Betreuung.  \nFazit\nDie Masterschool ist vor allem für Lernende mit Vorkenntnissen geeignet, die sich eigenständig durch anspruchsvolle Themen arbeiten können. Für Anfänger oder Personen ohne jegliches Vorwissen ist das Angebot jedoch nicht empfehlenswert. Die Organisation sollte dringend an der Struktur des Curriculums, der Betreuungskapazität und der Transparenz hinsichtlich des tatsächlichen Aufwands arbeiten. Angesichts der hohen Kurskosten wirkt der Nutzen des Programms im Vergleich zu frei zugänglichen Ressourcen wie YouTube oder ChatGPT fragwürdig.  \nBewertung: 2/5 Sternen\nPositiv hervorzuheben sind die Flexibilität und die Möglichkeit, wertvolle Kontakte zu knüpfen. Allerdings überwiegen die strukturellen und organisatorischen Mängel, sodass der Kurs sein Versprechen, für alle Wissenstände geeignet zu sein, nicht einhalten kann.",

Masterschool provided a structured environment to truly immerse myself in the world of coding, with a focus on hands-on projects and real-world challenges.\nOne of the biggest challenges I faced was transitioning from a background in logistics and customer service to mastering technical concepts like backend development, API creation, and database management. This was a steep learning curve, but the support I received from the Masterschool community and instructors made a world of difference. I appreciated their patience and the way they broke down complex topics into manageable pieces.\nThrough the program, I not only gained technical skills in Python, Django, and building APIs but also honed my problem-solving capabilities by tackling project-based learning and winning two hackathons as part of the curriculum. These experiences boosted my confidence significantly, making me feel ready for real-world challenges in software engineering.\nWhat stood out most for me, however, was the sense of community and networking. The collaborative atmosphere encouraged idea-sharing and peer support, and I forged connections that I’m sure will continue beyond the program. Masterschool didn’t just teach me how to code; it made me a part of a tech-driven, supportive ecosystem.",

There were many moments when I struggled with imposter syndrome, questioning whether I was really cut out for this career change.\nHowever, throughout the program, I received invaluable support from my mentor, which was crucial for my progress. Their guidance helped me to understand difficult concepts, and I also took the initiative to teach myself through additional research and self-learning. This combination of mentorship and self-study allowed me to overcome my doubts and keep pushing forward.\nOne of the biggest takeaways from the program is that if you come from a different background, it may feel like an uphill battle, but with dedication and perseverance, you can succeed. The program helped me build not only technical skills but also the confidence to apply them in real-world scenarios. However, it’s important to note that the program requires a 100% commitment. If you're not willing to put in the effort, it will be difficult to be fully prepared for a job in cybersecurity.\nOverall, Masterschool gave me the tools, support, and mindset I needed to pivot into the field of cybersecurity. It wasn’t an easy journey, but it was absolutely worth it, and I’m excited to see where my skills take me in the future.",

I appreciate how these tools were integrated into real-world projects that mirrored actual industry scenarios, allowing me to develop practical skills that are immediately applicable to the workplace.

Having a dedicated mentor made a significant difference, as I received personalized feedback and guidance, which kept me motivated and on track. The peer support network also enriched my experience, as we were encouraged to collaborate and learn from one another, building a sense of camaraderie that is rare in online programs.\nHowever, one area where I think Masterschool could enhance the experience is by providing more opportunities for advanced, specialized modules. While the foundational skills were covered thoroughly, I felt that additional deep dives into specific fields within data analytics, like machine learning, predictive modeling, or industry-specific applications, would add even more value for those looking to stand out in competitive job markets. Additionally, some sessions could benefit from a more hands-on approach, where students actively work through more complex case studies with instructors in real time.\nOverall, Masterschool’s focus on practical skills, mentorship, and community has equipped me with a strong toolkit for my career in data analytics.

The combination of theoretical concepts and practical application of tools like Python, SQL, and Tableau has transformed me into a capable individual contributor for complex projects.\nThe Career Accelerator Program offered by Masterschool has been exceptional. I have been paired with a dedicated Career Success Advisor who has assisted me in optimizing my LinkedIn profile and tailoring my resume and cover letter. Furthermore, my advisor has been actively involved in my job search and application process, providing invaluable support.\nI am profoundly grateful to Masterschool for this transformative experience. The program has not only expanded my technical skills but has also positioned me for greater success in the field of data analytics.",

Which is golden, developer career is a very lonely one. Having sidekicks, wingman's is simply great; especially when you are bleeding and sweating as a student.\nCompared to the program we had during our registration, MS did a lot of updates and changes.  Especially on the course to assist the students.\nThere is an internship program providing real life experience to the graduates. Which is another great attribute because you learn a lot at work compared to doing some side projects. Capstone projects etc.\nIt sure has pros and cons, for anyone really serious about dedicating 1000 hours during the bootcamp and 100s hours afterwards during the advanced training and again during internship will be those carving a path in hi-tech (however it looks gray atm the path you have chosen has countless joys, for eg seeing your custom scripts work, getting assistance from chatgpt and building  a better code. Don't worry even the best chatgpt can't do complicated stuff ^^, a good laborer though)\nI had the opportunity to have Success Based Education, which is expensive than regular but you pay when you work so given the economical and sectoral realities it is a fantastic opportunity as well.(Please check if it is still present before registration)\nBottomline I will suggest anyone following the innercall of being a developer, frontend / backend developer or even UI UX designer.\nI was tired during my job search and did start working on a sales position at the beginning of the year, I regret it in my 3rd week and found myself seeking the gaps in CRM, finding the security breaches and also playing with styles on developer tools when bored. :^)\nNeedless to say that sealed the path for me and finally had my job since the beginning of August 24. \nTLDR: You will work a lot, practice a lot, depressed a lot. But you will not be alone, you will have your entire cohort depressed together with you  joyful together with you. Also you will have access to individuals like me or your fellow students who will let you build a network.\n1000+ hrs dedication required, mental change and mental upgrades guaranteed. \nYou will have online/recorded sessions and tutors , professionals to assist.\nIf you are a fellow who needs some push to enter the sector, try MS.\nIn my honest opinion it's in between 4-5 so I gave 5 stars.\nJob hunt part depends in the individuals, it's upto students.",

Masterschool has truly helped me develop not just as a professional but as an individual.\nThank you again for the support and for being a part of this important chapter in my life!",

The program is especially suited for self-paced learners, offering in-depth knowledge in Python, SQL, Tableau, Google Sheets and more. The no-payment-until-you-find-a-job policy is a major plus, adding peace of mind during the job hunt.\nHowever, the career acceleration phase left much to be desired. Many of the promised workshops and networking opportunities didn’t materialize, and communication could be improved. On the positive side, the mastery projects were highly valuable and closely aligned with real-world scenarios.

The weekly live sessions provided a great opportunity to reinforce learning, stay accountable and engage with peers. \nOne of the best features of the program is the 24/7 support and I always felt supported when facing blockers. The training is intense and thorough but well-paced and definitely manageable if you have a good attitude and basic organisational skills.\nMasterschool excels in its career support and accelerator programs. The team went above and beyond to offer me personalised interview preparation, career coaching and (again) support. This is especially beneficial for those entering the corporate world for the first time. This also helped me build valuable relationships with mentors and expand my professional network.\nThe program requires a high level of self-discipline and organisation, but the rewards are directly proportional to the effort you put in. Can you learn these data analyst skills on your own? Absolutely. But, if you're looking for a programme that not only provides technical training but also supports your career aspirations every step of the way, Masterschool will go above and beyond to do that and help you succeed.",

They took me from knowing nothing about web development to creating dynamic and responsive full-stack websites. The curriculum is well-structured, and the combination of mentors, teachers, and an excellent internship program provided me with the hands-on experience I needed to succeed.\nWhile I initially faced a mismatch with my first school-master and mentor, any doubts I had were quickly resolved thanks to the incredible support from the instructors and my later mentor. A special mention goes to David, who was not just a mentor but also an outstanding teacher and a trusted guide throughout my learning process. His dedication and expertise truly made a difference in my education.\nEven after graduating, Masterschool continued to support me by helping me find a job. They guided me through mock interviews, informed me about job opportunities, and provided ongoing assistance in many other ways. Masterschool has proven to be a top-notch institution for anyone looking to dive into web development. I highly recommend them to anyone ready to embark on a similar journey.",

The training doesn't even have its own content, they just grant you access to sites that would be 4x cheaper to enroll on your own. I'm editing the review so people have in mind Masterschool's reply is full of lies. From my cohort, only one person is working in the field because they already worked before getting the certification which is way far from the 86% they state. Unless they count people landing a job in any field, which is quite deceiving. They're also requesting now I provide them personal information through Trustpilot, trying to pretend they care as if an entire year providing them feedback they've ignored wasn't enough of an insight.\nIt just takes a quick search on the training chat to find out like 90% of the users who wrote a 5-star review aren't/weren't even students. The disparity of feedback found here against the one you'd find on Reddit is quite suspicious. Beware of positive reviews on Reddit, they come from employees who'd waste their time trying to boost their online popularity instead of actually doing their job.\nAfter promising you'd just pay after landing a job, they keep on harassing you to start paying even though they don't help you at all with the job hunting. On the contrary, they're unable to foresee the reality of the market and realize you won't hold a chance to even get an interview unless you have a degree in Finance/Computer Science or something related to data analysis or the correspondent degrees for Cybersecurity Specialists.\nThey couldn't even keep their schoolmasters from quitting mid-term which speaks volumes about how they operate.",

I find the help button extremely efficient and well simply put \"extremely helpful\". I have had moments when I needed something resolved and/or something answered and the Masterschool staff always answered my questions and resolved my issues in a quick and timely manner. That has been I think the most critical thing for me. It makes me feel like Masterschool is organized and cares about the success of their students. \nI also really have benefitted from the resources provided such as the websites with virtual labs and hands on practice in the field you choose, mine being Cybersecurity. Also, they have plenty of reading material that is up to date and they recently added a website that doubles down on the information they provide in their own program which is beneficial to really cementing the material into my brain. It is nice to see how comprehensive it has been and appreciate the access to vital websites for our learning experience. \nNow I want to talk about the pace, which from my experience was very manageable. Although I had to take time off from studying, I found that when I was able to return, I was able to complete my assignments rather quickly because of the way the lessons are put together so efficiently. \nThe staff here at Masterschool always saw to it that I was placed in a position where I can succeed. I do highly appreciate that they encouraged us into a position where we can be better prepared in the moment and guide us to where we should be. always motivating us to continue studying and always having a positive approach to our progress instead of a negative harsh approach.

Classes were held in the evenings, allowing me to continue working and earning a living. During this time, I developed strong self-learning skills and the ability to meet assignment deadlines, engage in online lessons, and utilize learning videos effectively.\nThe investment in students, assignments, and projects at Masterschool was exceptionally professional. This approach enabled me to specialize and gain experience with a wide range of tools and software. After graduation, finding a job in the field was challenging, mainly due to the tech industry crisis. However, the team, particularly one outstanding instructor, Tal Mizrachi, supported me at every step of the job search process. They assisted with resume revisions, LinkedIn profile enhancements, and even arranged for me to work on paid projects to gain real-world experience. \nThese projects provided valuable hands-on training and exposure to practical scenarios, significantly enhancing my skill set and making me me well-prepared for interviews.\nThe job search took a year, which was both challenging and demanding. However, the constant support of the Masterschool team, especially my instructor Tal Mizrachi, who served as my professional and supportive anchor, made all the difference. I highly recommend the learning framework at Masterschool.\nIn April, after a year-long job search, I finally succeeded in passing an interview and was accepted to start a job at a well-known company. This process was closely guided by the Masterschool team, who ensured I navigated all stages of the interviews successfully and found a suitable position.

I'm enjoying the ACI learning material, and I think it's more \"alive\" than the LinkedIn Learning material (I don't mean to say that all LinkedIn Learning videos are bad, LinkedIn is a great platform.

I need more materials and support to feel more at home with all the tools.

Employers won't be interested in these; only the final capstone project holds any potential value.\nMoreover, if you're interested in free learning resources, they utilize content from Youtubers like Travesy, The Net Ninja, DevEd, and Web Simplified.\nI strongly advise against wasting your money. Essentially, they're providing you with a roadmap, which you can create yourself.\nReflecting on my experience, I felt overlooked and neglected. Out of 200 participants, about 10 seemed to receive preferential treatment, presumably those who they believe will repay the £11,000 fee with their new jobs.\nI attempted to join this privileged group, but to no avail.\nWhy are they considered \"special\"?\nManagement moved them into separate groups for advanced training ahead of time.\nThey were encouraged to collaborate and work on portfolio projects, including the capstone.\nAll of these individuals received scholarships!\nIn my opinion, it's not worth the £11,000 investment.\nI added this anonymously due to it back firing on me, but I just wanted to help somebody who reads this.",

When I ask some questions or if I have some technical issues, they always get it done or resolve. As former teacher myself, I like how they help me assess when I have difficulty with the lesson, they guide me in solving it but not spoon-feeding the answers. My School Master, Tim Wang, was also great! He shows concern to each of his student.  He would really check on you and would always say in the end of the conversation, \"Let me know if you have any questions for the projects\". It gives me an assurance and easiness that I can just reach out to him when I needed help.  And when he answers my query, he would elaborate it and make programming terms easy to understand.  I also like how he is responsive when I have questions regarding our projects and if I needed some validation with what I do. My classmates are all awesome too! We created a bond that makes us comfortable discussing our troubles and issues with our studies and balancing it with our personal lives. Especially Salman, who helps me improve my program for it to be more efficient. Over-all I am glad I took the chance to this course. As someone who has been out-of-work after moving here in US, it helps in opening up a new career. I also would like to add, all learning materials were great and easy to understand. When I say easy to understand, this is a perspective from a former teacher and school coordinator who prepared lesson plans, guide other teachers, and teach students for 9 years. I love how I can just learn it on my own time and pace. As a stay-at-home mom, it is a great advantage and great opportunity to get back to working again. It is a springboard for me to go back into becoming a professional woman again. Thank you so much Masterschool.",

Our assignments submitted are well reviewed and advised if necessary with further additional learning resources.\n3.\tI particularly appreciate how Masterschool consistently maintains its organizational structure and transparency. For instance, Sophie, the school success manager, sent me an email in which she called my attention to the need for me to schedule my study time as the upcoming days would be devoted to completing job applications and learning more difficult content. She also sent the course syllabus, which included information about unit dates and topics. Let me draw your attention here I have just crossed halfway of my learning road by finishing 5+ months of my dedicated learning and am about to start the 6th topic ie Python Programming.\n4.\tI adore how the Masterschool sprints always have us swinging back and forth between the present sprint and previous sprints, sharpening our understanding of every area. It has now been a habit for me to do extra studying because it keeps me current on the major issues, refreshes me, and also helps me understand the concepts better than when I first studied the subject.\n5.\tThe masterschool's desire to connect on LinkedIn is actually part of a prearranged plan for our future course of action. The plan was appealing to me.\n6.\tStudent Success Managers are always on the go, regularly mailing and texting on Slack, which appeals to their continual touch.\n7.\tThe frequency with which school MASTERS ask to schedule 1:1 online meetings demonstrates the level of dedication the masterschool has for their students.\n8.\tOur academic tutor on Slack assists us by highlighting challenging capstone or sprint assignment subjects and providing ready references and materials for our convenience.\n9.\tThe learning software provides us with a bubble chat feature, which is also fantastic and where academic lecturers were quite helpful for anything I am stuck on.\n \n \nAll in all, I AM LOVING IT  😍👍",

Additionally, an integral part of my success was the amazing community of peers I gained during my time as a student. I credit a large part of my success to this community. Now, I am lucky enough to call some of them my close friends as we enter the field together as Data Analysts.\nMasterschool puts its students first and always works to improve the student experience. I come from the education field, and this approach to learning is refreshing, as well as a necessity. They are highly receptive to student feedback and make accommodations to benefit their students in the best ways possible. They provided structure while also being flexible and meeting students' needs so we could be successful.\nI couldn't thank Masterschool enough for this life-changing education and experience!",

        "review": "Amazing Experience :)\nThe entire program was split into two -\n - the bootcamp itself which is a partnership between Masterschool and Practicum\n - the career accelerator portion, which was led 100% by Masterschool.\nThe bootcamp was extremely informative and a very well designed program, particularly for those that are good at self-learning. The format is almost fully self-study online “sprints” in the form of a particular web dev concept/s and then a project to tie in those newly learned skills. Or more accurately, a continuation of the same big project that we kept building up through the process of the bootcamp, and applying the skills learned in the current sprint to that project. Ultimately you come out with several rather large Fullstack, end-to-end projects that you have built up and are confident to present on your portfolio, and discuss during interviews.\nRegarding the Career Accelerator portion - I honestly did not expect the level of support and hand-holding that I received during that process. You are taken in and processed fully to be able to confidently apply and present yourself in interviews. There are no more fears when it comes to writing your CV. You are trained to make your applications perfect from both an HR perspective, as well as from a technical standpoint.\nYou are never alone, you will be guided both by HR personnel, as well as developers that are actively working in the field.\nEvery person in the career accelerator receives their own personal web developer mentor who is skilled in the industry and caters to your personal needs, developing a unique relationship with you and your particular background.\nEvery aspect of the application process is covered. CV’s, mock HR interviews, mock technical interviews, building up your online presence, job application tracking, portfolio projects, etc.\nI never felt for a minute that I was lost in the process.\nAlbeit, the procedure of landing your first junior job in the industry is never easy, and takes lots of work, as long as you follow Masterschool’s lead and follow the steps laid out by the career accelerator, you are sure to land your first gig in tech.",

The biggest problem I found while doing this was support if I need help understanding a particular problem, concept, or issue it would take a long time to solve, even if I couldn’t resolve the issue I was facing. I would often purchase another course similar made by someone else to see if they explained the concept that would be easier for me to understand than didn’t help and I got demotivated and frustrated and lost interest and stopped for a while.\nBack in May of 2021, the fire for Web development was reignited, I was more determined to achieve my goals and do something that I’ve always had a strong interest in and passion for. I started looking into Bootcamps. There were so many to choose from, Master school being one of them, at first, I just looked at it and carried on my search. Other boot camps were using technologies that I wasn’t interested in learning, Still, Masterschool kept coming up in my searches, Facebook ads, etc.\nI took a good look at the Web development course and found that they were exactly what I was looking for, so I thought I’d apply. The application process was simple and easy to follow. The team are helpful and answered my questions quickly and clearly.\nNow, I am about halfway through the course, and I must say that this was the best thing I have done! The instructors are amazing, they are always on hand to offer support when you need it, and the lessons are easy to follow. Your school masters will support you, offer you advice and be there for whatever you need. The most important part I think that’ll help you through this, is the community, the other students here have been amazing, we are all here to learn and we are all here to support each other regardless of our knowledge, ask questions, answer questions, don’t be afraid to get somethings wrong, it's leaning, take the initiative and form study groups for you to study together. Studying alone is difficult but if you have a place where you can go knowing there are others, will make this experience so much better.\nI have made many friends here studying in Master school, friends that I’ll always stay in contact with for a very, very long. I hope that I will be able to remain in contact with some of the staff that I have met along my journey, these people have made a lasting impression on me pushing me to my limits and beyond.\nThank you Master School for the work you have done with me so far, looking for to the next few months.",

And then you start the career accelerator part where you learn about all of the tools and skills needed to apply for a job.\nThe 7-month course is taught with 3 different tools: Udacity-hosted main course, Datacamp for practice and daily webinars for understanding thr projects on udacity and advanced topics. One can book a meeting with any of the teachers for further assistance. \nOne is required to invest around 20 hours/week to complete and understand the topics and projects. The best thing about the udacity course is that you really need to invest the time they ask you to. That means, it is very comprehensive. The udacity course is divided in sub sections. After every section you have a project, you need to complete the project according to the guidelines. The assistance at udacity would review it and won't pass the project until the guidelines are met. That said, you learn a lot with this hit and trial method.\nSome constructive criticism would be that the career accelerator should not start at the end of the course, rather it should go hand in hand with the course. Because what helps to get a job at the end is if you have a student job experience. And applying for that is hard work. For that you need to understand a lot of stuff and that could be a tooic to cover with the course. \nIf you are ready to put in thr work, the extra effort to land a job no matter what, then you will find the course really good for you. You have to pay nothing almost nothing when you start the course and do a contract to pay them back after you land a job. And they take full responsibility that you get one. That is a big factor for a student who can't pay a lot of money to learn something. And they are always ready to help. Put in the work and persistence, you will benefit.\nGurinder Arora",

Don't get me wrong, the course materials are really good but the amount of stuff (high level linear algebra, statistics, and programing skills) you'll need to learn is a bit too much for 10 months. You will find yourself studying outside of the course's curriculum to complete what you do not know. It's not a bad thing but be prepared for that when you sign up for the program.\n2) Be ready to study alone. Not all the time you'll be able to find someone to study with (since it's a course you do at your own pace) so sometimes your study Budy will be behind you or ahead of you. \nAll in all, I'm very happy with my choice to study at Practicum100 - I did it instead of a university diploma and I was able to find a job in the field with little hussel.",

        "review": "DO NOT SPEND THE $15,000. Please look elsewhere. \nI started in the Data Analytics school with Charlotte Chaze at the end of June and I withdrew from the program at the end of August. Right off the bat I should've known this was not extremely organized/researched much. \nFirst, they advertise with industry \"experts\" but that is EXTREMELY EXTREMELY misleading as they do not actually do any of the teaching and you talk with the once a week in a \"School Master Live Session\". Usually these sessions were more of a background on the individual and offered no real help \nSecondly, my interview for the program was awful. The interviewer scolded me for my background not being blurred and the lighting being bad. It left me with a very bad taste in my mouth. However, I decided to give Masterschool another chance. Bad idea. \nThe program is split up by weeks, usually with each week being a new course with there being live sessions every week. They communicate through slack and have different channels set up which I thought was nice. Immediately I noticed there was no organization on how to ask question/get feedback from the \"instructors\" so it became a big jumbled mess in the chat that was entirely too difficult to navigate to get any real value from. \nNow I say instructors in quotations because they quite possibly hired anyone with data analytics experience. This sounds great, however, it became clear very quickly that they had no clue how to teach. These live sessions usually became a random hour long session of monologues and jokes by the instructors with such little being actually taught I usually ended up more confused than when I started the session. Masterschool also switched up instructors throughout the course so you were learning contrasting things from each instructor as they each taught you their way and not a general way of programming.  \nAside from the live sessions you also have independent work. Now this is where I really started to question what I signed up for. The independent work was outsourced to a different data analytics bootcamp type program, Udacity. This was very strange to me because I had previously research Udacity before deciding on going with Masterschool(I would suggest Udacity's program as it is much cheaper and you are basically doing the same thing in Masterschool). This ultimately was the breaking point for me because I realized I was essentially paying extra for Masterschool's \"instructors\" to teach me nothing, crack jokes, talk off topic, figure out how to work zoom WHILE ON THE CALL, painfully try to answer questions with way too much explanation it usually took 5-10 minutes per question(these live sessions and instructors were a huge turnoff for me if you cannot tell). \nNow, you're not just paying extra for the instructors, but also the school master and their career advice. This was a phony lie and I will explain what happens/how it works. I'm not sure what I expected from the school masters but it was more than what they put out considering they were the face of the programs. Like I said they did none of the teaching and had once a week live sessions about their backgrounds and \"why data analytics\" topics. They also had one-on-one meetings but those and the once a week live sessions never actually happened as my school master went on vacation and then just never came back. \nSave the effort and look into other bootcamps/programs, maybe even the Udacity one. Maybe even check out associate degree programs since $15,000/$300 per credit hr is 50 hours. This program/school/company was so not it and I cannot recommend you look somewhere else more. I'd say the only good thing this brought me was the motivation to enroll into a computer science program at a local university. \nHope this was helpful!",

While looking for a job, I came across with their course link that promises success based payment and immediately started searching about it. At first, I thought it may be a scam but after the elimination phases of the program, I understood that it is very serious and I had to go for it.\nThe course itself has quite of workload, you should keep it in mind if you already are busy. But it's totally worth dealing with this intensity. Duirng that intensity, you have a lot of material to carefully read for being able to complete the excercises in the interactive coding platform provided. When ever you are stuck with an expercise or reading material you can reach out to the team who are well experienced. Additionally, you have to be able to finish projects including real business problems every two weeks, so that you can move forward in the whole program. These projects add a lot to your analytical approach to the problems and to your coding skills to implement your solutions. \nAfter finishing the final project, the course finishes and there is a career accelerator track which helps you learn how to distinguish among other canditates who apply to the same jobs. You learn how to arrange your CV, how to write your cover letter before applying for jobs and how to summurize your elevator pitch while making unplanned connections. In addition to these, there are also some internship opportunities. I was lucky to have an intern position.\nIf you are considering building your new career in data analysis, Masterschool is the best place to start!",

The programme puts a lot of emphasis on creating a safe learning environment where students can open up to ask questions, experiment new ideas and are encouraged to help one another.\nEnglish being the “language of the high-tech industry”, the programme is entirely taught in English, which gives the students access to the plethora of Data Science resources available on the internet as well as a common vocabulary with guest speakers from all over the world. \nThey do not stop after your have acquired your MVK though.

It was a small assignment and an 1-1 interview. Only 100 candidates among ~4000 applications in Germany were chosen for the program in 2021.\n+ 9months intensive training: important data analyst topics were introduced together with related theory and applied techniques (Python, SQL, Tableau, etc.) then practiced directly on real case projects. Simple yet effective.\n+ Career acceleration phase: CV optimization, mock HR and technical interview on demand, weekly technical practice sessions and weekly seminars covering various soft skill topics, networking and various career days, etc. No time limit, support is constantly there until you are good on your own.\nAll in all:  I’ve never regretted joining the program and think it has shortened my career change by at least 1-2 years.",

I was willing to work very hard to keep up with intensive tempo of studying.\nOne of the crucial things for me when deciding for Masterschool is their success based model. Students pay their tuition fee after they find a job! This helped me not to \"carry heavy burden\" but rather to focus on subject and studying. This also means Masterschool is choosing participants for the program very carefuly because our success is their success.\nPracticum100 includes 100 best talents and we had 9 months to finish different business projects which was an opportunity to get to know diverse industries (banking, e-commerce, telecomunication, mobility service provider, fitness industry, social media, restaurants,...).\nWe used platform on which we had access to the studying material very well organised and presented. In 2 week sprints we were obligated to learn the theory, finish small assignments and a particular project. Projects were reviewed by Data Analyst professionals and were accepted only if we delivered true and wide enough insights with a meaningful business recommendation. If we were not able to deliver in time (being overwhelmed with our everyday jobs and family obligations) we could easily communicate this to find a solution. Saturday's Marathons were organised in that case as well; all day long interaction between mentors, instructors and students for more encouragement. \nWe had mentors and could ask questions any time. \nCommunity managers made sure cummunication is always working smothly. I really liked weekly webinars where we would learn even more from our mentors or from data professionals from different companies. \nAfter finishing our Final Project we got our certificate but work wasn't done. \nWe continued with another program; Career Accelerator (CA). I found Practicum100 to be excellent but this one exceeded my expectations.\nIn this period we started to search for jobs. The amount of support we got in CA was just amazing. We were led through all important details that play significant role in the job search process; CVs, networking, portfolios, interview simulations (technical and soft skill), weekly squad meeting where we would share our lows and the highs of our job search, access to the Data Camp platform where we continued to brush our skills and learn new ones, weekly group Tecnical practice and regular webinars.\nThey gave us every possible support anyone could have asked at any point, emotional support included, which is very important to have during this intensive program. During both programs we were regularly asked to give feedback so they can improve even more and give us even more support.\nI am about to start on my new job next week and will be forever grateful for amazing service and support that Masterschool gave me!",

I took the chance and finished the pre-course and moved on to the presentation part. unfortunately, I didn't get accepted to the first cohort, but after 2-3 months another one opened and I got accepted.\nThe program itself is very well thought out, you work in intervals of 2 weeks apart which at the end of each period you have to submit a project in order to move on. the learning process is integrated with the newest and most up-to-date technologies, which gives you good chances of landing a job. You don't do so well on interviews and have some spare time? the internship program is for you(this is how I landed my first ever job in the industry, without any experience or degree).\nYou basically follow the platform which dives into a lot of different fields regarding Data-Analysis, If you get stuck or confused there's a team of mentors that are always available and more than happy to help. Each project you submit is reviewed and then again after you revise it until it is accepted (which lets you learn in the best way, your own mistakes!). There's a dedicated slack channel to share information with your fellow students which gives you a wider glance at how to cope with different obstacles.\nAfter the period of the course, A career accelerator program is launched and you are getting real-life training and exampled from top tech companies about the tests and interviews you are going to be faced with.\nBasically, to sum it up I am more than happy to have taken that chance and explored my curiosity. I found a profession that challenges me, gives me room to progress and learn new things every day, The course was so organized and smooth that I was quick to get answers and learn as time went by. And the best thing is, you pay only once you are accepted to a job and get paid higher than the stated threshold.\nI would advise anyone whos in a place in life where he wants to change his career to not think twice and that the course. you wond regret it ;)",

Designing such a program isn't trivial, especially in such a diverse field.\nThe course was compromised of self-study portions, lectures, and assignments. The lectures were given by top specialist in the relevant fields, and the self-study portions were built to strengthen the foundation we received in these lectures. These self-study portions were great to try and tackle the material, while having some backup in the form of TA (who were also experts in the respective fields). Finally, the assignments were constructed with the specific field of work in mind, and now that I am employed as a data scientist I can see that they were amazingly tailored to real work needs.\nDuring the course we had full time support from a Masterschool designated staff member (Niv, who was amazing). This means that as needs arose the program adapted in real time. We had daily and weekly surveys which helped maneuver time limitations, and other issues.\nAll in all, it was a well built, well tailored, extremely enjoyable experience.",

It was built on a culture of continuous improvement (which was also a great example for our own future work). We filled in regular surveys and had great communication with our manager, Niv (who was excellent!).

Every two weeks I was working on new project, practicing newly achieved skills, and when it came to Career Accelerator stage I had 11 projects on my GitHub, and with the set of tools I’ve learnt I could apply to almost any Data Analyst position.\nI will never forget one of my reviewers, Grigoriy. He barely ever accepted my projects from first try even if I thought they were fine, and when I asked him why, he said “YOU can do it even better, let’s bring it to perfection”. So from my own experience I can say that the team truly cares about quality, and reviewer’s comments helped me a lot in future.\nI always felt support of my community manager, Jen, so motivative and inspiring. \nAnd what was really surprising: even though tuition was online, I met a lot of amazing people, with many of them we became good friends. Even though I graduated 2 years ago, we are still in touch, meet offline and support each other.\nCareer Accelerator was a bridge between course and actual job. Mock tech and HR interviews were stressful, but the feedback helped me to prepare for real interviews and not to feel anxious about it anymore.\nI didn’t have any technical background when I started, and had to invest A LOT of time to progress and graduate, but it was definitely worth it.",

Die Community Manager, das gesamte Team und glücklicherweise auch meine Kurspartner*innen haben mich von Anfang an unterstützt. Ich habe mich während des gesamten Kurses sehr gut aufgehoben, wertgeschätzt und betreut gefühlt.\nDer Kurs hält absolut, was er verspricht – ich hätte mir kein besseres Bootcamp aussuchen können. Die Inhalte sind didaktisch hervorragend aufbereitet (und das sage ich als jemand, der selbst an einer deutschen Universität gelehrt hat). Die Struktur ist so gestaltet, dass Teilnehmende mit unterschiedlichem Vorwissen dort abgeholt werden, wo sie stehen. Auch ohne vorherige Erfahrung in Data Science kann man dem Kurs sehr gut folgen – vorausgesetzt, man bringt ein gewisses technisches Verständnis und eine gute Auffassungsgabe für Daten mit.\nDie Lehre ist eine gelungene Mischung aus fundierter Theorie und praxisnahen, projektbezogenen Aufgaben, die direkt auf die Arbeit in Unternehmen vorbereiten. Wer sich überfordert fühlt, erhält zusätzliche Erklärangebote und wird bei technischen Herausforderungen sehr kleinschrittig und empathisch begleitet. Wer sich unterfordert fühlt, kann sich jederzeit an Bonusaufgaben versuchen.\nDie Instructors der WBS habe ich in über 95 % der Fälle als hervorragend organisiert und fachlich sehr kompetent erlebt. Fragen werden individuell, verständlich und mit viel Geduld beantwortet – selbst bei größeren Gruppen.\nEin weiteres Plus ist die Karriereberatung, die deutlich macht, dass es sich um ein seriöses Weiterbildungsangebot handelt. Natürlich kann niemand einen Job garantieren – der Arbeitsmarkt ist momentan hart umkämpft – aber die Tipps und Tools, die man im Kurs erhält, sind praxisnah und wertvoll.\nBesonders hervorheben möchte ich zwei Dozierende, die mich mit ihrer didaktischen Klarheit und Geduld beeindruckt haben: Markus Hoffmann und ganz besonders Vasil Georgiev – vielen, vielen Dank für eure großartige Arbeit!\nFazit: Ich kann die WBS Coding School uneingeschränkt weiterempfehlen. Ich habe in kürzester Zeit das und mehr gelernt, was ich mir vor dem Kurs als optimales Outcome erhofft hatte.",

The course is tough, but it teaches you so much. The staff is great, the teachers are really good. Our teacher in our batch waswas fantastic, motivating us and making sure we understand and stay on track with everything.

Our main instructor was fantastic!\nWhat I loved most is that the course is project-oriented. You not only learn technical skills but also pick up valuable soft skills and teamwork experience along the way.\nThe supporting instructors are super helpful, too. They give you the space to find solutions on your own, guiding you to discover answers rather than just handing them to you.\nThe curriculum is well-structured and serves as a great resource that you can always refer back to.\nI learned a ton of Python and various tools that I definitely wouldn’t have tackled on my own. The only area I think could be more practical is A/B testing; it felt a bit too mathematical and less applicable to real-world scenarios.\nAs for the career services, there’s room for improvement. They tend to be a bit general and often cater to multiple batches in one session, but you do get personal reviews, which is nice.\nOverall, it was a rewarding experience, and I feel much more prepared for my next steps!",

        "review": "I did a bootcamp at this school that was paid for by the German government. My advice to anyone thinking of doing a coding bootcamp is do not waste your time, especially if you are self-funding.\nThe course itself is a waste of time, full of tutors who are ex-students that couldn't get a job in the industry, so they are taking minimum pay, recycling the course material for new students over and over. Out of 20 students in a batch, maybe 2 or 3 of those students will get a job afterwards. Those who do usually already had experience in software development before starting the course. The majority of students will be left in no man's land, wondering what just happened. Don't forget, this course is sold as '90% of students get a job within the first year'... This simply isn't true.\nThere is no pass criteria for this course; it's basically a participation medal that you get at the end. I definitely felt like I'd been duped by the end of the course. I guess these courses are exploiting a skills gap in the market, and using government funds to drive their business model. Except when the vast majority of students graduating from this course cannot get a job, it sort of isn't filling a gap, more like draining taxpayers' money. God help you if you self-funded and are still unemployed after doing this course.",

But they don't make APPs for google play or apple store.\nOn the page it says \"APPLY NOW\". The knowledge test is a joke, even your grandmother can pass it and just like an interview, the important thing is that you pay, then you can access. \nAll the classes are online and they have no control over the teachers, we had the bad luck that we had a teacher who gave classes while he was travelling in America, despite our complaints the academy did not react until two months later (the course lasts three months) and put another teacher. In addition, the teacher fell asleep or turned off the camera during the weekly project presentations, was not able to solve the exercises and skipped the explanations of the syllabus on the online platform. \nThere are no personal assessment exams. In the end all students receive a certificate from the academy whether they have done the exercises well or not at all...it's more like a certificate of attendance. \nYou are forced to work in a team and it was rare to get it right, some didn't connect, others did everything on their own...\nThey advertised that 92% of the students find a job associated with the technologies and I doubt it very much, in my class there were 19 of us and maybe 20% of them will get it. \nThe person who was assigned to us for the \"CAREER SUPPORT\" part didn't know how to write English well and I didn't think her advice was very good. \nThe course is extremely expensive for what it is...The course is not worth that at all....But they don't care because it is financed by the arbeitsamt.\nGOOD:\nThey work with codecademy, you can use a premium account during the course.\nThey use discord chat and google meet to manage the classes. \nYou can make appointments with junior teachers for questions.\nThe learning platform they use you can continue to use it after the end of the course.\nIf you are lucky you can get a good teacher. \nThey record all the explanations of topics, events... you can access them whenever you want.\nThey repeat the explanations of the syllabus and can be accessed by anyone.\nMy final opinion: \nI would not do a course at this academy again.\nI would not recommend this school.",

The training seemed to start well... the first 3 months were fine, but then the company decided to lay off many employees, which had a huge impact on the next 7 months of training.\nThey promise that language courses will be paid for, and if you attend at least 90% of the lessons, they will cover the cost of an exam, such as TELC, Goethe, or other similar exams. Unfortunately, this never happened. They simply didn’t cover anything. In the end, they only offered an online test to assess your language skills, which is completely useless and doesn’t compare to a real exam like TELC or Goethe.\nOver the next 7 months, the instructors kept changing, from quite good to outright bad.\nMost of my learning was carried out with the help of ChatGPT and YouTube, but NOT DCI.\nThen came the final project, followed by the \"internship\"...\nDon’t get your hopes up that they will find you an internship with any tech company... that's all a lie. If you don’t find it yourself, you’ll be stuck with their completely useless career support, where a well-meaning lady will read slide information to you. (By the way, the information is trivial and superficial, taken not from real experience but from random YouTube video titles about job searching, like:\nDon't wear slippers to an interview\nPrepare your LinkedIn profile\nMake your CV look nice\nLearn new skills\nThey'll read this out for half an hour once a week... It’s absolutely terrible.\nIn the end, you’ll be asked to return the equipment (which is not real equipment at all), and you’ll be removed from all communication channels with the management. Even if you still have questions, don’t expect any answers.\nSummary:\nDisorganization and lack of communication with management\nChanging terms without notice\nInadequate career support\nBroken promises\nThey promise to find you an internship and even offer a job through their \"partner tech companies\", but that’s all a lie — no one will offer you either an internship or a job. They promise, but they won't deliver.\nStay away and don’t waste your time! This course costs an unjustifiable amount.",

The lectures were concise most of the times, and if they weren't, there was a considerable amount of good will on the teachers side to help clear the misunderstanding or unclear parts.\nAlso, having been surrounded by nice people and colleagues who were willing to help with code issues (here I especially mean two tutors and a few other colleagues) were strongest reasons for DCI earning that one star from me. \nI couldn't complain to my communication with the class management, although I know that some other colleagues weren't satisified at all when at times it seemed even the class managers could only shrug their shoulders after listening to our complaints because their hands seemed tied to address some of the issues (let's mention only not being able to record the lessons for later, which would have been a great help in learning).\nNow, I will follow with a few complaints in order to justify why I wouldn't give more than one star and give some suggestions.  \nOn a general level, there seems to be a big discrepancy between how things about the courses are presented when advertising the course, and how they turn out when actually coming to the realization stage. \nThe Orientation Course, at least the one being held in 2023. by my humble opinion didn't at all offer a fair representation of all the longer courses it should help attendees orientate towards. Namely, Python, Java, AWS, Salesforce were fit each in half a day or a day in the best case, which definitely couldn't be enough for someone to decide whether they would take any of these courses, at least not based on the experiences gained about these courses in the Orientation Course.\nFor instance, I was initially interested more in learning Python than Web Development, but as Python was underrepresented, I didn't dare to choose Python based on a one day experience.\nAs I did subsequently choose a one year Web Dev course, I could say that from today's perspective, had I encountered the JavaScript in the Orientation Course phase, I probably wouldn't have decided for Web Dev. As simple as that.\nMy suggestion would be to please significantly improve the structure of the orientation course to include more relevant information on all the courses offered. Also bear in mind that the Orientation Course should be more discriminative for attendees that might not be successful in the one year course. The goal of Orientation Course, along giving fair information about one year courses would also be to reduce the content related drop out rate in the one year courses, after the Bildungsgutschein by ArbeitsAmt has already been issued.\nContinuing, I don't know about other courses, but my general complaint to DCI advertisement strategies is they should be leveled down to bear the reality check. If the situation on the market is tough, the advertising of the courses should be fit accordingly.\nNamely, I suggest to put an up to date 1. feedback about different courses completion/dropout rates as well as 2. placement statistics separately for each course, especially after the finish of alumni period. 3. Also mention how many graduates have managed to land an internship, land a job after an internship, land an internship in the DCI partner companies, and  most importantly land a job after internships in DCI partner companies, as a certain control indicator of whether the courses are adequately tailored to the DCI partners needs or not.\nThe materials that we've learned in the one year Web Dev course are a good basis for further learning, but unfortunately not more than that. Therefore most of the colleagues in my course generation didn't stand a real chance even for the internship.\nHence, I would strongly suggest to please take down the 80% placement rate slogan, and rather update it monthly with relevant data across all the courses DCI offers, as mentioned above. \nMy final and most important suggestion would be to work and arrange with your partners companies to assure a 100% internship for all the alumni that finish any of the DCI longer courses, and help support covering the adequate part of all the future students Bildungsgutscheins costs based on every successful candidate that any partner company decides to keep after successfully finishing the internship phase.\nThis would be the real proof of DCI programs tailored to their partners needs and a DCI that I'd consider giving more than only 1 star.\nSincerely and constructively, \nTomislav Miljak",

Namely, Python, Java, AWS, Salesforce were fit each in half a day or a day in the best case, which definitely couldn't be enough for someone to decide whether they would take any of these courses, at least not based on the experiences gained about these courses in the Orientation Course.\nFor instance, I was initially interested more in learning Python than Web Development, but as Python was underrepresented, I didn't dare to choose Python based on a one day experience.\nAs I did subsequently choose a one year Web Dev course, I could say that from today's perspective, had I encountered the JavaScript in the Orientation Course phase, I probably wouldn't have decided for Web Dev. As simple as that.\nMy suggestion would be to please significantly improve the structure of the orientation course to include more relevant information on all the courses offered. Also bear in mind that the Orientation Course should be more discriminative for attendees that might not be successful in the one year course. The goal of Orientation Course, along giving fair information about one year courses would also be to reduce the content related drop out rate in the one year courses, after the Bildungsgutschein by ArbeitsAmt has already been issued.\nContinuing, I don't know about other courses, but my general complaint to DCI advertisement strategies is they should be leveled down to bear the reality check. If the situation on the market is tough, the advertising of the courses should be fit accordingly.\nNamely, I suggest to put an up to date 1. feedback about different courses completion/dropout rates as well as 2. placement statistics separately for each course, especially after the finish of alumni period. 3. Also mention how many graduates have managed to land an internship, land a job after an internship, land an internship in the DCI partner companies, and  most importantly land a job after internships in DCI partner companies, as a certain control indicator of whether the courses are adequately tailored to the DCI partners needs or not.\nThe materials that we've learned in the one year Web Dev course are a good basis for further learning, but unfortunately not more than that. Therefore most of the colleagues in my course generation didn't stand a real chance even for the internship.\nHence, I would strongly suggest to please take down the 80% placement rate slogan, and rather update it monthly with relevant data across all the courses DCI offers, as mentioned above. \nMy final and most important suggestion would be to work and arrange with your partners companies to assure a 100% internship for all the alumni that finish any of the DCI longer courses, and help support covering the adequate part of all the future students Bildungsgutscheins costs based on every successful candidate that any partner company decides to keep after successfully finishing the internship phase.\nThis would be the real proof of DCI programs tailored to their partners needs and a DCI that I'd consider giving more than only 1 star.\nSincerely and constructively, \nTomislav Miljak",

I hope they find something better.",

        "review": "My opinion on the online marketing…\nMy opinion on the online marketing course from DCI: If you are looking for helpful advice, don’t waste your time on DCI. Let’s look at some negative points:\nMost teachers don’t know the subject deeply enough, so they only teach the basics, which won’t help you get a job (don’t believe everything marketers say).\nYou are put into small groups on Google Meet, given a 1.5-hour task, and the teachers leave to enjoy their coffee.\nThe tasks are unclear, even native speakers don’t understand their purpose.\nAt the end of the course, you get a certificate that has no real value compared to an Umschulung or Ausbildung.\n99% of their clients are foreigners, most of whom recently arrived in Germany.\nA B1-level certificate is clearly not enough.\nThe course costs about €30,000, but honestly, it shouldn’t be more than €4,000 (maybe there’s something about the price we don’t know).\nThe course lasts 12 months, but such courses should take no more than 3 months.\nOne positive thing: The people are very friendly (80%), though some are too young and don’t know how to handle students.\nMy advice: Try something with an IHK certificate or an Umschulung. (I feel sorry for my colleagues, myself, and everyone taking this course).",

Wer glaubt, dass Kunden aus sensiblen Branchen Ihre Entwicklungsdaten auf GitHub ablegen, ist sehr weit von der Realität entfernt.\nDa ist der Tanz um die heilige Kuh \"Agile\" wichtiger, als das wofür sie vom AA bezahlt werden: Das Vermitteln von Coding-Know-How",

        "review": "Ich habe kürzlich das 4-wöchige IT Project Management Bootcamp auf Englisch bei neuefische absolviert und bin begeistert. Das Bootcamp hat meine Erwartungen übertroffen, insbesondere hinsichtlich der praktischen Ausrichtung.\nWas mir besonders gefallen hat:\nDie perfekte Mischung aus Theorie und Praxis: Die Inhalte wurden verständlich vermittelt und durch zahlreiche Praxisbeispiele veranschaulicht.\nDie offene und kollegiale Lernatmosphäre: Die flache Hierarchie zwischen Coaches und Teilnehmern sowie die Möglichkeit zum Austausch mit anderen Teilnehmern haben das Lernen enorm bereichert.\nDie individuelle Betreuung: Coach Katharina, Chao und Jay haben mir persönlich sehr geholfen und standen immer mit Rat und Tat zur Seite.\nDie Fusion von neuefische und Spiced Academy hat zu einer noch größeren Vielfalt an Kursangeboten geführt. Ich habe bereits ein erfolgreiches Bootcamp vor einigen Jahren bei Spiced absolviert und kann nun beide Unternehmen wärmstens empfehlen. Beide zeichnen sich durch hochqualitative Weiterbildungen, eine ausgezeichnete Betreuung und professioelle Coaches mit einerumfangreichen Berufspraxis in unterschiedlichen Branchen.\nDie praktische Ausrichtung, insbesondere das eigene Capstone Projekt war besonders herausfordernd und hat mir gezeigt, wie viel ich bereits im Bootcamp und davor gelernt habe. Die offene und kollegiale Lernatmosphäre hat mir sehr gefallen. Ich habe mich sofort wohlgefühlt und konnte mich gut mit den anderen Teilnehmern und Coaches austauschen.\nIch kann dieses Bootcamp und Andere jedem empfehlen, der seine Karriere im IT-Projektmanagement vorantreiben möchte. neuefische bietet aber noch viele weitere interessante Weiterbildungen!",

        "review": "Hier wird keine ausführliche begeisterte Rezension geschrieben. Genauso wie keine zerschmetternde Kritik. Auf den Punkt gebracht:\n- Coaches und die Gruppe waren ein Glückstreffer. Harmonisch, kompetent, inspirierend\n- Aussichten nach dem UX/UI-Kurs: sehr bescheiden. Nur wenige Absolventen haben den Einstieg als UX/UI-Designer geschafft. Meine Erfahrung: Nach 100+ Bewerbungen keine Stelle in diesem Bereich erhalten. Obwohl ich kein 100%er Quereinsteiger bin (komme aus dem Bereich Mediengestaltung). \n- Karriereservice der Schule: Katastrophal bzw. völlig nutzlos. Man muss die Zuständigen mehrfach anstupsen und nachhaken, wie weit die Vermittlung gerade ist. Um am Ende zu hören: Bewirb dich doch selber, denk aber daran, uns als Referenz anzugeben, denn das wird gern gesehen (was aber, wie bereits erwähnt, zu keinem Vorstellungsgespräch geführt hat).\n- Vermittelte Kenntnisse und Skills: sehr oberflächlich (kein Wunder bei 3 Monaten). Neue fische lehnt sich dabei nicht zu weit aus dem Fenster, indem sie betont: dies hier ist nur Anfang und die richtige Kompetenz kommt erst im Job. Den müsst ihr aber erstmal kriegen, und das wird trotz allen Partnerprogrammen etc. sicherlich kein schneller Weg sein. Ich meinerseits habe es nach über einem Jahr aufgegeben und bin wieder im alten Beruf gelandet.",

        "review": "Also, zunächst war ich doch recht skeptisch und hatte Zweifel, dass ich nach dem Bootcamp ein Unternehmen finden werde, das offen sein wird für Absolventen, die NUR ein Bootcamp gemacht haben und vorher nichts mit der IT zu tun hatten, ABER ich wurde eines Besseren belehrt. Als Ex-Recruiter wusste ich bereits, wie die Mehrheit der Unternehmen in Deutschland denkt bezüglich klassischer Ausbildung und Quereinstieg. Trotz des Fachkräftemangels des Grauens, der ab 2035 ja noch mehr Tempo aufnehmen wird, dachte ich, es wird sehr schwer werden, einen Einstieg zu finden. Ich bin auch davon ausgegangen, dass die Anforderungen an uns Quereinsteiger so hoch sein werden wie bei jemandem, der von der Uni oder von der Ausbildung kommt. Das mag in vielen Unternehmen nach wie vor der IST-Zustand sein, aber es gibt auch aktuell wenige Unternehmen, die Quereinsteigern Chancen geben. Es braucht einfach viel Geduld, und man muss gut sein in den Coding Challenges, die zum Großteil darüber entscheiden werden, ob man den Job bekommt oder nicht. Projekte vorweisen, ja, das ist schön und gut, in meinem Fall habe ich ein Blatt Papier bekommen und einen Stift und durfte die FizzBuzz-Aufgabe lösen... in 10 Minuten. Ich rate jedem, der kann, eine Ausbildung zum Fachinformatiker zu machen, eine Umschulung oder das Studium und ein Bootcamp nur dann zu wählen, wenn es anders nicht geht oder man bereit ist, das Risiko einzugehen, dass man erstmal keinen Job bekommt. Ich habe 30 Bewerbungen versendet, und ich hatte nur 1 Gespräch, bei dem es glücklicherweise direkt geklappt hat. Ich bin jedoch positiv gestimmt, dass Bootcamps und der Quereinstieg immer mehr ein Thema werden. Es gibt auch viele Unternehmen, die bereits intern Quereinsteiger ausbilden und sozusagen ein internes Bootcamp mit den Quereinsteigern durchlaufen. Dies sind erst anfängliche Entwicklungen, die bestimmt rasant Fahrtwind aufnehmen werden. Wenn Du jetzt immernoch das Bootcamp machen möchtest, dann kann ich die neuefische nur empfehlen, Top Leute dort!",

Vor dem Bootcamp, hatte ich bereits begonnen, selbst JS und React zu lernen. \nDie Schulungsinhalte waren gut strukturiert, und innerhalb dieser scheinbar kurzen 3 Monate konnte ich schnell und effektiv Fortschritte erzielen. Die Trainer waren stets bereit und leicht erreichbar, um in allen Belangen zu helfen. \nEin weiterer Pluspunkt war die Ausrichtung des Trainings als Vorbereitung auf das Agile-Arbeitsmodell. Ich kann diesen Kurs auf jeden Fall empfehlen",

        "review": "The education you receive is not worth the price tag. Many of the lecturers Data Science knowledge is only from doing the bootcamp themselves prior to being your teacher. There's only 2 months of lectures before you are left on your own to complete your capstone. The marketing theu use to sell the bootcamp is not true. There is not a high employment rate after the bootcamp. The education is not enough to become a Data Science. There are no partner companies giving you projects or data for your capstone. But you won't be told this surprise until the last minute. The partner companies very rarely employ anyone from the bootcamp, if ever. The Career support they promise is a lie. They have no interest in helping you get a job, though they may show a slight interest if you identify as female. Its seems like their promotion of gender equality is more like reverse descrimination. \nMost people do the course free through Bildungsgutschein and they are then offered €500 to entice their friends to apply for it. There friends are then also given €500 of vouchers for joining. This is ethically questionable given the funds are coming from public funds, and in my opinion shows the poor educational value of the course. You receive a certificate of attendance just for showing up, regardless of your capabilities. Again, this has zero value since there are no test metrics to prove your ability. Many Data Science jobs on linked in have 500 applicants, Junior positions often have over 1000. The market is flooded with people who do these courses and their only hope of employment is as Data Science bootcamp lecturers, growing the pyramid scheme.",

        "review": "Zusammenfassung: Trotz einiger positiver Aspekte war ich insgesamt enttäuscht von diesem Kurs, vor allem wegen des schlechten Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnisses, fehlender Struktur und zurückgehaltener Informationen. Hier sind die Details meiner Erfahrung:\nIch hatte mich ganz bewusst für einen Kurs eingeschrieben, der mir von einem ehemaligen Arbeitskollegen empfohlen wurde. Generell war das Feedback von Leuten, die denselben Kurs belegt hatten, sehr positiv.\nLeider lief bei unserem Kurs einiges schief. Der Coach, der für die vorherigen Kurse verantwortlich war, verließ das Unternehmen zu Beginn des Kurses, was dazu führte, dass wir in den ersten zwei Wochen einen wirklich schlechten Unterricht hatten. Zum Glück wurde dann eine Notbremse gezogen und ein neuer Coach eingestellt. Dieser leitete den Kurs zusammen mit einem angehenden Coach. Obwohl der Unterricht sich verbesserte, war keine klare Linie zu erkennen. Auf viele Fragen gab es keine klaren Antworten oder wir wurden vertröstet. Das abschließende Capstone-Projekt war eher eine Farce. Angekündigte Code-Reviews wurden nicht durchgeführt, Fragen wurden falsch beantwortet und allgemein hatte man oft das Gefühl, auf sich allein gestellt zu sein.\nAls dann das von Anfang an angekündigte Abschlussevent mit den Firmen ausfiel, war bei den meisten Mitschülern das Verständnis am Ende. Viele waren so frustriert, dass sie nicht einmal mehr ein Feedbackgespräch führen wollten. Ich gehörte zu denen, die trotzdem ein solches Gespräch gesucht haben. Der Kurs kostete über 12.000 €, und für diesen Preis war die Leistung wirklich schwach. Ich hätte den gleichen Inhalt auch in drei Monaten auf Udemy lernen können, der versprochene Mehrwert durch das Capstone-Projekt, die Zusammenarbeit über Github und die versprochene Unterstützung bei der Jobsuche mit Firmen fiel komplett weg.\nMir wurde in meinem Feedbackgespräch versprochen, dass eine mögliche Kompensation geprüft würde. Seitdem (das ist jetzt über zwei Monate her) habe ich jedoch nichts mehr gehört.",

Auf meine Email und der Frage nach einem Angebot, bekam ich eine plumpe Absage. Ich vermute mein Englisch war nicht gut genug für den Kurs.\nIch verstehe halt nicht wie das Unternehmen Geld verdienen möchte, wenn nicht mehr Zeit für die Menschen investiert wird.

For people who have studied computer science or something similar before it might be OK, but for someone who truly wants to learn and change careers it's a complete waste of time and money. You can actually end up more confused and worse off than before you started (that was my case and I wasn't even completely new to the topics). You will get the same or even a better experience googling all the topics and using all the free online resources.\nSince the pandemic they decided to expand and grow and start as many students and cohorts as fast as possible. Most assistants are nice but almost never available when you need them. Each class is with a randomly selected assistant so there's never a good transition between topics. They say it's 700 hours in 3 months but you are lucky if you even get 4 hours per day.\nNo one pays for the bootcamp, the German government pays, which is also why most people don't care if they truly learned something or not. A real money making machine for them.",
