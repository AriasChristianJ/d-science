The teachers and staff are knowledgeable, supportive, and truly care about students’ success. The curriculum is well-structured, covering everything from Ruby and databases to JavaScript and front-end development.That said, the pace was extremely fast—sometimes too fast for me. I often felt like I was falling behind, and there wasn’t always enough time to fully absorb concepts before moving on to the next topic. I wish this could be a one-year program instead of nine weeks, as I think that would allow for deeper learning and more confidence in applying what we’ve learned.If you feel like some sort of genius, this bootcamp will probably be easy for you. But if you have learning difficulties like I do, it’s going to be hard—really hard. Be prepared to put in extra effort, ask a lot of questions, and sometimes feel overwhelmed.A few pieces of advice:\nDo not overestimate the prep work—do it as many times as you can before the bootcamp starts.\nDo not do the bootcamp online if you have the choice—being in person makes a huge difference.\nDo not try to work a job while doing this bootcamp—it’s intense, and you will often go back home to finish assignments or simply try to understand what you just learned.\nIf you’re considering Le Wagon, I’d definitely recommend it, but be ready for an intense learning journey. It’s great if you thrive in a fast-paced environment, but if you need more time to digest complex topics, you might find it overwhelming.",

The bootcamp is very well structured, covers the most important ML and DL algorithms as well as SQL, Docker, MLflow and cloud platforms such as GCP. It is suited for people without any prior coding experience (like me) but also for people that already have some prior python experience. The teachers are very well prepared and with very strong technical skills. The learning experience is very well supported through Le Wagon's learning platform and the guidance and support of the teachers and the TA's . It finishes with a 2-week team project where one can practically apply the concepts and skills acquired throughout the Bootcamp. Le Wagon also offers top job search services upon successful completion of the Bootcamp as well as  networking platforms for their alumni. The batches are small 10-20 people, which gives you more time for personal coaching and 1 on 1 meetings with the teachers to discuss newly learned concepts or difficulties that have aroused. I am extremely satisfied with my experience throughout the Data Science & AI Bootcamp. It was intensive and challenging, but every bit of it was worth it. I would definitely recommend Le Wagon for anyone that wants to dive into the tech world.",

It has also been as much fun as it has been frustrating. I came every morning to Meguro class hall and worked there until the end of the afternoon for two entire months. In the beginning, we did lecture in the morning, then pair programming in the afternoon until the last hour, which was dedicated to live coding. Teacher assistants were always around to give a hand, as I was all the time bumping into a hardship I could overcome as a beginner. I was a beginner but some students were already experienced in some aspects of programming.\nOur group was extremely diverse, with people living in Japan for years and other students coming from abroad thanks to weak Japanese yen and discovering Tokyo, some of us speaking two or more languages, within a vast age range (from people under 20 to people over 45). The result was a friendly learning batch full of curiosity. Once we acquired programming basics, I joined a team of four students and we worked on a real-world app project during the last weeks. My teammates were motivated and everyone contributed. We planned and executed like pros, made many beginner mistakes, and I learned a lot from these last weeks. The last day of the BootCamp was demo day, and we presented our app to a full room.",

From day one, I felt immersed in a well-structured curriculum that guided me from the basics of data manipulation to more advanced topics like machine learning and AI. The instructors were genuinely supportive, breaking down complex concepts into understandable pieces, and I really appreciated the sense of community—everyone was learning, struggling, and celebrating together. I left feeling more confident not just in my coding and analytical abilities, but also in my capacity to tackle real-world problems.",

    "review": "Honestly, I'd probably give this boot camp four stars. I did hate all the emojis and the words of encouragement saying you're now a \"machine learning engineer\" or a \"Data Scientist\", because let's face it, you're not. That's the reason for the one star. In the post 2022 market, completing a bootcamp isn't going to help you  \"change your life, break into tech\". Just go onto the CS subreddits. You might actually be better off leaving the bootcamp experience off your resume as the market is oversaturated right now. If you're asking for job placement rates, be sure to ask for 2023 or 2024 stats, and in particular the roles people got. The marketing materials often highlight graduates who ended up at say a top company, failing to mention that 1) they were previously employed at a similar company in a different role, and 2) they graduated before 2022. \n\nIf you have 7k to spend and are just looking for a cool experience, go for it. If you're looking for a job, pick a different industry or do a legit MSCS or MSDS. Gatech's online Masters is about the same price as the bootcamp, but you'll have an actual degree. Nonetheless, even with a Master's finding a job will be an uphill battle. Good luck!",

The structure of the programme was very well thought out and enabled a clear and understandable learning process. I found the mixture of theory and practice particularly positive, as we were able to apply what we had learnt directly in projects.\n\nThe teachers were extremely competent and supportive. They were always at our side when questions arose and helped us to think independently and find solutions. I particularly appreciated the challenge of working in a team, as this not only developed my technical skills, but also my social skills.\n\nThe final project was particularly intense, but also incredibly rewarding. It was impressive how much I learnt in such a short time and how much I was able to improve my skills. Overall, the bootcamp was challenging but very motivating. I would recommend it to anyone who is ready to fully commit to learning and is looking for an exciting challenge.",

The learning curriculum covers all essentials to gain a holistic view for web development, from front-end, back-end, tools, platforms, a bit of product development. I transformed from a non-coder to a coder --- which all thanks to this intensive 12 weeks. I love the setting of live lecture - challenges - live code mechanism. The challenges everyday were well selected and relevant to the course. It helps me learn and apply for what I learnt. The lecturers and TAs(teacher assistants) were really helpful as well. Project weeks were the highlight where I got the chance to work on real projects and make an application functional, but these were also the most intense weeks as well. At the end of the bootcamp, we got one extra week for career, where we can update our CV, LinkedIn, Github pages and get ourselves job search ready. Overall I am very satisfied with it. One concern I have to the curriculum is that we didn't learn enough javascript which is the most popular language at the job market right now.",

While probably possible to get everything done in the 9 am - to 6 pm course hours, I needed to assign a lot more time to properly understand the content. This was made easier by all lecture recordings being made available in advance so I could always watch one before the live lecture as preparation. \nThe project weeks give great insight into the process of developing an app from scratch (Web Dev BootCamp) from the idea conception to launch into production and valuable skills like code review and coding in a team.\nThe careers team are very helpful too, they have sessions throughout the BootCamp and also after you graduate. You also remain part of the LW slack channel and have contact with all of the shared channels to reach out to other alumni.\nI secured a place on the government-funded BootCamp so didn't have to pay for it, I'm not sure if I would have fronted up the money at the start of the BootCamp (due to my financial situation) but it has the potential to be a valuable investment if you make the most of the resources made available to you over it's duration.",

C'est totalement insane. \nOn n'est jamais seul, toujours une personne pour vous aider, vous accompagner à trouver la réponse. \n\nLe service administratif est très présent pour vous soutenir tout du long de votre formation. \n\nC'était un batch d'été 2024 en petit groupe de 7. \nJ'ai vécu une très très belle expérience. \n\nJ'espère que ma review permettra à d'autres de se lancer dans l'aventure et à prendre un ticket pour le prochain Wagon.",
