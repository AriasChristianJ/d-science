Thankfully the staff of teachers was super experienced and knew how to explain ununderstandable material with some techniques and advanced curriculum.

05.06.2024,"1) very shabby place. It stinks in the room connecting different rooms.	
2) the toilets are more like open toilets - you can literally hear the breathing of the person in the cabin next to you. You can hear all the talks from the people on the main floor from the toilet.	
3) the toilets are super cold.	
4) given that in 2024 there is not much demand for new IT professionals (who have little or no background in IT), there is no point in going through this suffering sorry. Better to look for something else. Money and job opportunities is the same in other less intensive fields.	
Plus keep in mind that salaries for IT professionals in Berlin is a joke.	
	
Better invest your time and energy somewhere else.	",google

If you need to learn something that wouldn't help you find a job, then Le Wagon would be your first choice ðŸ˜…
They have Slack channels for jobs. All the jobs are either Ruby positions with more than 3 years experience or even other stacks like node.js or python ðŸ˜†
I don't know why they still have ruby on rails. I know it's an easy stack to start with for beginners, but don't trust their numbers says that all web-track graduates have found jobs and bla bla bla.
More than 6 months have passed after finishing my batch, and there are still even no jobs for junior ruby developers to apply for, and I have been learning Node.js.
Try to find another place that teaches with Java, Python, or Node.js.
These people are good in marketing, not in programming, and most of the TAs were unprofessional, unskilled, and incompetent. That doesn't mean they weren't nice, but it's not enough to be nice bro, oder? ðŸ˜…",google

For my further career path, I wanted to learn more about Python and machine learning methods. It was the right decision for me to do the bootcamp at le wagon! I had a great time and learned a lot. In retrospect, I am very impressed with the teaching and the many nice people at le wagon. There are so many nice ideas that made it easier for me to learn the new material in a short amount of time. I would especially like to highlight the teachers and lectures. The lectures were very exciting and challenging, but always fair and understandable. If something was unclear, the team of teachers took care of you very well. I also liked the study plan very much. There was a lecture in the morning and programming tasks afterwards. We solved the programming tasks in the buddy system. We were assigned a new classmate every day and then solved the tasks together. The system helped me a lot in mastering the challenges. Great idea :) The teaching experience was rounded out by numerous community events that made for great class bonding. There were comedy shows, pub quizzes, after-work drinks, and even a Mario Kart tournament. Helped a lot getting to know the class and teachers.
Can highly recommend the bootcamp at Le wagon overall. Was a great experience, I would do it again anytime and it definitely moved me forward.",google

05.06.2019,"As a philosophy student, I had a few creative ideas that I hope to develop, but was unable to due to my lack of technical skills.
In 9 weeks, Le Wagon gave us an insight into what it's like to materialize an idea. The bootcamp is divided into two stages - the first stage consists of learning the basics of Ruby, Javascript, CSS, SQL, and other tools, and the second stage consists of applying what weâ€™ve learned to practice (i.e. develop websites using whatâ€™ve learned!).
As an aspiring product manager/entrepreneur, the second stage was especially helpful since we learned how to pitch ideas, measure the feasibility of developing an idea in a limited amount of time, create user-journeys, design prototypes for website, and work as and with developers to create websites. We were constantly supported by hardworking and patient teaching assistants and other students despite all the mental struggles!
Also, I came to the bootcamp with a biased pre-conception that developers are antisocial; this presumption was totally reversed by the end of the first day! Everyone was very open-minded and social. Le Wagon also makes sure that we get the chance to know everyone in the bootcamp - each day, we are paired up with a new buddy with whom we cooperate to solve daily coding challenges. Personally, I consider this the best part of the bootcamp because I was not only able to cooperate with people from diverse backgrounds, but was also able to see how each person think differently by taking different approaches to solve a problem!
Le Wagon also organized quite a few career talks with product managers, entrepreneurs, and developers - I was able to gain perspectives on what I might be interested in doing after my studies by learning about work experiences of invited speakers, classmates, and alumni.
This bootcamp in Berlin is really a wonderful experience and the highlight of my summer!",google

Teaching material hasnâ€™t been updated in over 5 years in some cases (you can check that on their GitHub repos), teachers are unmotivated, donâ€™t come to class or even forgot to prepare the class. Sometime a mop of teachers having a party while another tries to teach. Itâ€™s definitely not a bootcamp, but rather a scam camp.
Moste positive reviews you see here are from teachers of le wagon and therefor shouldnâ€™t be counted.
Even the teacher themselves weherer complaining about le wagon during the bootcamp. Some teacher where embarrassed to teach the poorly put together material. Itâ€™s such a joke.
If you go on Reddit you read stories of people who go harassed by le wagon to change or delete there negative reviews.",google

There are 2 team projects with Rails, first project being the practice building a simple marketplace webapp in 1 week, and second project being the final project built in 2 weeks with a team of 4-5 people. Having these prototype projects led me to multiple interviews right after the bootcamp. Highly recommended for people who would like to kickstart their career as web developers",google
05.06.2019,"I am a business graduate and worked as a finance professional before entering Le Wagon. Tech-related work always interested me and I tried to pick up bits and pieces about coding, but never really had the perseverance and wholistic knowledge resources to really get started in tech. Building a website requires knowledge about so many programming languages, frameworks, and concepts that I was never really able to bring all the pieces together.
A friend of me told me about Le Wagon and the learning style seemed to be perfect for me. Le Wagon has an intranet with resources that help during and after the bootcamp. The bootcamp is built around this intranet and I learned how to solve technical issues with and without help from instructors.
After the bootcamp, I was able to build complete websites with all sorts of functionality, design features, and user interactivity. As I started a data science degree program after the bootcamp, I benefited from the software development skills that the bootcamp provides to students. Now, I am not only confident in web development, but I can also transfer these skills to other software development-related fields.
Our ""batch"" (that is the bunch of people that did the bootcamp with me at the same time in Berlin) was international to more than 50% and we spoke English 99% of the time. Everyone had a different background and almost everyone had a big career change coming up.
