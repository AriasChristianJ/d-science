1,Ironhack,2023-01-12,"It was an amazing learning at Ironhack. I chose my career change from Automobile industry to UX/UI design in tech industry. The whole experience from the admission till you graduate is extremely interactive & fun. The institute offers you time to time career counselling as well. If you have a faith in yourself and guidance from Ironhack your career change is going to be far more easy. To land on your first job depends on your portfolio, hard-work and patience. I would recommend",coursereport
2,Ironhack,2022-12-30,"I've decided to start coding and learning data science when I no longer was happy being a journalist. In 3 monthes, i've learned more than i could expect: it was trully life changing! I've got a new job in just two monthes after finishing my bootcamp and couldn't be happier! Best life decision ever!",coursereport
3,Ironhack,2022-12-26,"I started the bootcamp with little to no expirience related to the field and finished it ready to work. This materialized as a job in only ten days after completing the Career Week, where they prepared me for the job hunt. It was a great way of jump starting my new career, paired with great people and fond memories, 10/10!",coursereport
4,Ironhack,2022-12-12,I had an amazing experience at IronHack. I am now working in a completely new career thanks to the skills I learned there. The opening welcoming environment gave me the opportunity to thrive. Learning skills that have and will continue to be life changing.,coursereport
5,Ironhack,2022-12-04,"I had an amazing experience from beginning to end. The amount of support I received is unparalleled. My classmates, teacher and teacher's assistant stay in contact and support each other to this day. Ironhack gave me a glimpse into a world that was a mystery to me and taught me the tools needed to be a creative coder. It changed my life!",coursereport
6,Ironhack,2022-12-04,"I didn't have so many expectations, all I wanted is trying a new path hoping for a better job. However, it was a great experience even though it was a 3-month online course I got to be close to my teachers and the students we had fun and were encouraged to be close we got support and our questions were welcomed. it was condensed but very organized and this made it feel easier, and I keep going back to my notes and the student portal. The process helped us to have good projects and build a portfolio in a relatively very short time and I found a job through my last Ironhack project collaboration and that was great. I am still in contact with my Ironhack family, and this is a good feeling as it is an intense process but they created a safe place for us to support each other. I know this could sound cheesy but this is the way I related to stuff and how things feel easier to me is to feel connected to it and that was what I felt connected.",coursereport
7,Ironhack,2022-12-02,"I had a really nice experience with international cohorts from all around the world, we had a nice atmosphere between us. Really human and a nice teacher and teacher assistants who made my journey through the bootcamp easier. It was hard work but I am glad I took the decision to go through it.",coursereport
8,Ironhack,2022-12-01,"I have never thought about being able to learn so much in such a short time surrounded by really nice and professional people. I'm a career changer at 43 years old, and never felt uncomfortable (neither physically with their top-of-the-line furniture!) From the moment I came for the first time to get to know the Campus, when coincidently the same who was going to be my instructor, received me and gave very useful tips that help me to decide and choose between the other 3 Bootcamps. The program manager, instructors, colleagues, and all the events they do, together with a very updated curriculum program for the classes, make every so pleasant to learn when is time to do it. If you are wondering to start a new career in tech, don't doubt and waste your time, turn yourself into an IRONHACKER!",coursereport
9,Ironhack,2022-11-28,"I attended the UX/UI Design Part-time Remote Bootcamp. I had a wonderful experience from start to end; I didn't think I'd build such a strong network and meet new friends as much as I did. Here's a summary of what you can expect (pros and cons, I guess): Pros: - The environment: being in class every day was something wonderful. Initially, it is kind of awkward, but the bonds you create out of that are amazing! - The staff: the teachers in Ironhack that I've met are super nice and supportive; also, they have something they call TAs (teacher assistants). They are the sweetest and are always by your side, all the way! - The content: it's A LOT of content, what you'll have to learn, but if you decide to start this adventure, be sure that the content is updated to the latest! - The portfolio: being able to finish the Bootcamp with a portfolio ready to start the job hunt process is amazing! - Job Hunt: Ironhack has something called ""CareerWeek,"" where you'll learn how to address companies and headhunters. Also, they now have a job hunt platform that seems really interesting. Cons: - The Bootcamp is in English: if you don't have a good level of English, improve it before starting it! - Work hard, party hard: you get what you put in the Bootcamp. Be ready to spend more hours than the ones you'll be in class. It's worth doing it. I hope this is helpful to someone out there! If you are thinking of changing to tech and UX/UI design, this Bootcamp is a GREAT option!",coursereport
10,Ironhack,2022-11-25,"I learned about Ironhack through a close friend of mine who was happy with her experience, and when I finally got the chance to continue my studies I also signed up there. I can not stop giving positive reviews about everything I lived and learned. It was crucial for me in order to transition to a different job path and I can confirm the final results were amazing.",coursereport
11,Ironhack,2022-09-20,"I took UX/UI Design full-time course on May-August 21'. I really enjoyed it! I had a lot of material to practice with. Also, I received many 1 to 1 calls from my tutor, Juno, who helped me by giving much peace of advice and recommendations I would improve, maybe to have at least 1 more project for the web. Cause I feel I'm missing this kind of practice. But generally, all the projects were different and varied. Also, I got 1 week of code course. And here I feel grateful for receiving a recommendation to take an introductory Html/CSS course before getting to Ironhack. It helped me to understand much better all the knowledge I received from my tutor. Thanks to Ironhack I had some great friends with whom I keep in touch! And also, I wanted to say thanks to myself for making this change and taking the Ironhack course on time; making a huge effort to finish all the tasks on time in order to start looking for a job. I would really recommend this course to everyone who feels like changing his/her career to UX/UI side. But dedicate your full time and more to take 100% advantage of it. It really offers many tools and knowledge. But the only one responsible of this change is the person taking it",coursereport
12,Ironhack,2022-09-20,"From zero to hero in Data Analytics. Amazing course, amazing support from teachers, staff and classmates. Great career guidance to find a job after finishing the bootcamp, in less than 4 months I was already working as a Data Analyst in a medium-seniority role.",coursereport
13,Ironhack,2021-01-23,"Experience: The teacher and the TAs (teacher assistants) are nice but most of the class material is just readout loud without added extra. Ironhack itself is very unorganized, the communication with the Portuguese team was very difficult and we constantly received misleading information, or in my case, I got ignored once we signed the contract. I received a wrong statement and after 4 months still, no answer even though I followed-up in writing. The course: heavily focused on Python, we only had 1 week-worth of SQL from zero to advanced. Please be aware that SQL will be needed to get a job and the Python skill you learn is basically rushing through different functions day-by-day with little space to practice. The homework (Labs) are confusing, we constantly had to ask the TAs to explain what the questions meant. Sometimes it seems like someone translated text to English from another language with google translate without checking the outcome. Overall: Overpriced and not well structured. The curriculum needs to be re-designed and the (professional) quality of the teachers are rather low. both the teachers and teacher assistants are very nice people, the vibes are good but this won't make up for your time and money spent. I hope that Ironhack can improve the quality of their courses because the idea itself is fantastic but not executed professionally.",coursereport
14,Ironhack,2020-08-20,"I did the bootcamp for Web Development on March/20. It was at the beginning at the corona crises, and the school had to prepare the whole program to be offered remotely, so mine was the first remote class. I was really impressed by the quality of it, since they had to put it together basically within one week, so it wouldn't affect the schedule. The staff was always great, I really loved the teacher, and the assistants were there for us even in late hours, which they didn't had to. I start programming nothing, and throughout the bootcamp, I build a game, a website, and an app in React. It was a really great experience and a big step changing careers for me. I also learned a lot throughout the career week. The only negative side, from my point of view, was the job fair. Since we couldn't do it in person, it was online, and I felt like the companies that were interviewing us didn't know our levels, or what the course was about. Some were asking for very skilled people, others for free lancers, and I understood that they would offer positions as Junior Developers, related to what we learned, and it wasn't the case. Other than that, our coach really showed prepared, and brought relevant knowledge when it comes to preparing ourselves for the interviews , and how to apply for jobs, how to make our CVS and Linkedin page interesting for recruiters, and so forth . All in all, it was a great experience and I'm super happy I did it at Ironhack. I'm really satisfied and I will definitely recommend it to anyone that ask me how was it.",coursereport
15,Ironhack,2020-07-03,Excellent choice to get introduced into Data Analytics. It's been only 4 weeks and the progress is exponential. I would recommend the bootcamp not only if you want to change your career path towards Data Analytics but also to acquire some hard skills use data in other roles / industries.,coursereport
16,Ironhack,2020-06-08,"My experience as a student and later help teacher in Ironhack was nothing short of amazing. As an added bonus, the beer is both cheaper than it was in Oslo (where I'm from) and better, and you get to share that beer with people that - even though you only study with them for 2 months - you will remember and know for the rest of your life. I am writing this review 2 years after finishing my bootcamp. One of the things I remember reading about (which I kind of doubted before starting) was the friendship everyone said you develop with co-participants, and how tight you become as a group. I was proven wrong. The Ironhack staff of Berlin almost forced us to become good friends! Now now, hear me out. After a first day of introduction games, name games and an already overwhelming amount of work, the participants would go out together and have a drink. And after a hard day's work (and on every Friday!) we would do the same. We had pair-programming everyday during classes and did independent projects in pairs or trios. The work is so intense, and you spend so much time with your peers, that by the time the first week is over, it will feel like you've already known the others for a long time. You end up with a sort of ""us against the work""-mentality because of the sheer amount, where you just have to band together to beat the monster that is the Daily Exercise. I feel that I don't really need to say much about the effectiveness of Ironhack's teaching. I got a job after 1 month. I had zero prior coding skills, or even math skills, just an interest for gaming and technology. Most of my cohort got a job in way less time, many even before the camp ended. I got to be a help teacher after my bootcamp and can give a few tips, as some of the difficulties students had were similar in the next group. - Read up and get as good as you can before the bootcamp. I was not particularly well prepared (I would say average to below average skill level), and had to work that much more. Don't do what I did. Don't procrastinate the pre-work. The workload is massive, and ""getting back on track"" when you start off-track is really, really hard. - Additionally, go out with the other participants! Get a beer (or ten)! Switch places in the classroom! Say yes to all the outings and beers and lunches and whatnot. Remember that when you're done there, your skill level is only one part of the picture. Your network and friendships are the stuff you actually remember. And practially speaking, I now have multiple contacts within the tech industry from all around the world. So make it a good experience by having fun, and not drowning in the work, and it's a win-win. - Take some distance. Take at least one day off per week. Don't ""use the weekend to get back on track"" (you will say this at some point). You will need the time off in the long run, just trust me on that.",coursereport
17,Ironhack,2020-04-28,"I had an awesome experience during my Ironhack Berlin bootcamp! It was a very social, and oriented towards getting the students a job as a webdeveloper after the course is finished. They have a friendly staff, a nice campus and I felt like they all worked extremely hard to satisfy the students. The course is very intense but this is something I prefer myself as it also nurtures a steep learning curve!",coursereport
18,Ironhack,2020-04-27,"Taking part in this Bootcamp was probably the best decision I've made so far. The instructors are extremely skilled and pro-active to help you learn as much as possible. The curriculum is well-structured but it is intense, so be aware that you need to come with full dedication and motivation. Joining Ironhack is not just simply participating in a course, it's joining a community where you will meet friends for life. Would 100% recommend Ironhack to anyone who wants to learn web dev!",coursereport

20,Ironhack,2020-03-20,"I thought about giving up my life in marketing and switching to web development for a long time, and finding out about bootcamps really solidified that decision for me. After 6 years spent in university, an additional 3-5 years as a student did not seem appealing. However, pure online learning also proved difficult with a fulltime job. Because of this, a bootcamp seemed like the ideal option. I reviewed bootcamps online and talked to several people who had completed several courses. I ended up choosing Ironhack because after going through the application process for several schools, Ironhack seemed like the best fit for my goals. The entire 9 weeks was very well structured in my opinion. We had an amazing instructor who clearly enjoyed teaching and was very talented at what he did. Our teaching assistants were also exceptionally helpful, and the group dynamic was amazing. It's still hard to believe that at the start of the bootcamp I barely knew anything about HTML and CSS, and at the end of the course I was able to build pretty cool web apps on my own. I fully recommend this course to anyone looking to transition their career – but be aware that it is hard work, and you need to be motivated to go through the tough times and face the unknown.",coursereport
21,Ironhack,2020-02-11,"Failed miserably. Extremely unprofessional, not reliable, disorganized. Let me summarize my experience. After some experience in theoretical math, I wanted to make something more concrete. So I decided to go to a boot camp for data analysis in Berlin, where I live. Since Ironhack was the cheapest one among others (still not so cheap, 7500 euros for 9 weeks), I was inclined to get the course offered by Ironhack. Here is what happened afterward: 1- Three weeks ago I contacted them and we made a 1-hour in-person meeting with Mr. López on the 31st of January. In that meeting, Mr. López told me that I might be overqualified yet we both agreed that I should take their technical assessment. He also asked me to go over their preparation material. The assessment was set to the 4th of Feb. 2- Over the weekend I went over the material that took app. 5 hours. 3- I went to Ironhack to take the test. The TA who was supposed to execute the assessment told me that I was supposed to bring my own computer. But I was not told that I had to bring my own computer. So, this tech company told me that their company laptop was stolen and they are unable to provide me a laptop so that they could execute the assessment test. We had a nice 1-hour long chat with the TA. He was a nice guy who is a recent (last summer) graduate of one of the other boot camps. 4- Since the assessment failed, we organized a second meeting (this time online) for today. Yet, this morning I got an email saying - they thank me very much for my participation in their admissions process for the last couple of weeks. - But sadly they have to inform me that their TA is out sick today and the March course has also been filled to capacity, which means they won't be able to interview me at this moment. - They also add that they know this is a bit of a short notice, but hey!!! as it is in tech, things tend to happen very quickly. - They also wished me the very best in my next endeavors. I was in contact with these people for around two and a half weeks, they asked me to go over tasks which cost my time, yet they didn't inform me that the capacity was about to fill. I replied to their email and summarized the above to them as well. I ended my email as follows: ""...After all these, now, this morning, 4 hours before my technical assessment, Ironhack realizes that they have only one TA and no empty spot for the next month's course. You neither sound reasonable, nor believable. I am glad that I learned the way Ironhack works before I spent 7500 euros. Apparently, Ironhack is an untrustworthy company."" They thanked me for my email.",coursereport
22,Ironhack,2019-11-07,"Ironhack was a great experience: sharing about UI/UX with classmates and having the Teacher and TAs supporting us. It also feels a very open environment to talk about anything we need. The encouragement of having a community is great because after we graduated I'm still in contact with the rest of the Ironhackers. It's a lot of work, but it's worth it. The program also helps to understand the german job market, what is expected from you, and how can you insert yourself in it. Carrier Support is very valuable. Staff is always willing to help you to have the best experience.",coursereport
23,Ironhack,2019-05-23,"I recently completed a web dev Bootcamp in Berlin. My experience with the Bootcamp was amazing. I found the teachers, TAsa and the staff really helpful. I have learned so much in such a short period of time. I highly recommended for people who are interested in this field and looking into changing their career. (A little tip for the Bootcamp: study basic javascript, HTML, CSS as much as possible before the Bootcamp! It would really help you to learn more advanced stuff)",coursereport
24,Ironhack,2019-05-22,"Coming from a communications background I wasn't sure a bootcamp was for me, but all the wonderful people at Ironhack proved me wrong. It was the best experience to learn fast and surrounded by motivated international people from all backgrounds (which is difficult when you learn online to be honest). The learnings were incredible and the feeling of achievement after 9 weeks was great. If you consider a bootcamp do Ironhack, if you consider a campus come to Berlin :)",coursereport
25,Ironhack,2018-09-09,"I took the Ironhack bootcamp in between working as a Business Development Manager in the Berlin startup ecosystem and starting a Master's degree in Data Science. My objective was to understand software architecture in order to work as a Product Manager, how web apps are created from scratch and to try out potentially moving fully to a job in software engineering. My experience with Ironhack was absolutely fantastic and I would do it again, anytime. I will answer the questions I had when picking a bootcamp and hope this can help any future student. Why not do an online course ? What I found very special with Ironhack was how teachers and peers were an amazing motivation, something you don't get online. The teachers were available every day until 10 pm and even on weekends, which I found incredible, everytime with a smile on their face. The teaching team also spend significant time on team building and allowing the students to get to know each other with after school events, cooking sessions, giving the whole experience a very personal touch. They were extremely helpful with every question I ever had, no matter how basic. Studying with a cohort of students and sharing a physical classroom made it much easier for me to keep it up even during hard days where the learning felt like a lot of work. Whats the niveau of the course and how much time do I need to spend during the course? I personally had some previous coding experience (Python and C++, but six years before the time of the course) and no idea about front end. There is elaborate pre-work distributed by Ironhack before the start of the physical course that allows you to prepare yourself if you feel insecure about being ready. I did not spend a lot of time on it and found that we were ""caught up onto the same level"" within the first days of the bootcamp. The course is intense and requires you to spend some long evenings in class, however, it is clear that everyone learns for themselves and teachers are supportive no matter what effort you make - if you keep it low for two days, you will not punished with a frown or less attention. Teachers continuously checked up on the students level of understanding and offered additional courses and catch-up sessions whenever needed. In general it does feel like the whole group goes from ""0 to 100"" in the two month, coding-wise. Does it make you job ready? Totally. I personally was not looking for employment after the bootcamp as I was starting a Master's degree, but nevertheless talked to many CTOs, companies etc in the course of the bootcamp and realized how ""good"" you get at Ironhack. Talking to my peers and seeing where (and how quickly) they got hired gives me the confidence to say, it makes you absolutely job ready.",coursereport
26,Ironhack,2025-04-18,"Arrogant staff and teacher assistant. They behave as they are doing you a favor (the reason is in the line below). The quality of education is low—worth half of what they charge. The reason is that most students don’t pay: their government pays for them (Germany and France), and Spanish and Portuguese students get a deal where they only pay when (or if) they find a job. In conclusion, people don’t pay, so they accept anything they get. The teacher and the management have zero experience in the tech industry. Their first job in tech is teaching… They are all former students. Very weird business format. The career advisors are a joke. Their English is “Berry Bad,” and if they have a partnership with any company—which I doubt—they will, of course, favor the students who will pay them when they get a job. Before I chose Ironhack, I read reviews saying exactly the same things I’m writing now, but I didn’t consider them. That was my biggest mistake. I should have chosen LeWagon, Code Academy, or any other school. the only positive thing was the leading teacher, he was a cool guy but he couldn't do much in such a bad company. The students were also nice too. Anyway if you are thinking of paying their fee you will regret.",coursereport
27,Ironhack,2023-02-15,"Studying at Ironhack is a hell of an experience! The program is structured really well and the overall course is challenging, but in a very positive way. I absolutely recommend the Full Time In-Person bootcamp, the relationship that you can build with your peers and teachers is great and make you learn at light speed. The environment is always friendly and helpful and the overall learning experience is something that I end up loving. I really recommend this bootcamp.",coursereport
28,Ironhack,2022-12-29,It was an important step for my professional career changing because on the bootcamp a could get faster and better information to improve my skills also I had all assistance by the instructors when I was in doubt.,coursereport
29,Ironhack,2022-12-20,"Hi guys, The boot camp was a very good and productive experience for me. You can learn a lot and even more important you get access to a lot of very motivated people. I took the full time course because I wanted to block the 3 month completely and just focus in my training. You definitely get a good impression of the cyber security profession and you can do the boot camp even without a lot of prior IT knowledge. I would recommend to familiarize yourself with general knowledge about Linux and Windows before so that you can gain more benefit by more purely focusing on Cybersecurity related training and not just general It stuff. You guess right understanding the system we are protecting is necessary to do the job right. The boot camp is focused on the core Cyber security knowledge and does that really well. You also get access to job hunt training which you should use a much as you can because even if there are a lot of jobs out there people need to see you. And now about the most important issue. As far as I know everyone out of my boot camp who really took the time and did extra work and was in a study group doing extra learning got a job. Some took a bit longer because of country related differences or because they needed some more general knowledge but in the end there are enough jobs out there which need to be filled :) If you are prepared to focus on learning and keep learning even after the boot camp you will get a job ! But don't expected to get one just by finishing and doing the minimum that won't be enough. Have fun",coursereport
30,Ironhack,2022-12-08,"After exploring several options, I opted for the remote part-time UX/UI Design bootcamp at Ironhack due to its good references. Furthermore, Ironhack offered me a schedule that better suited my needs, along with the possibility of doing it remotely. The experience was intense; each session had a lot of information, so I had to dedicate time and prioritize the bootcamp work over other things for a few months. However, I remember it fondly, full of learning, and I shared good times with the people in the class. One of the things I liked most about the remote mode was sharing projects with multicultural teams, which enriched the exchange of ideas and the bootcamp experience. After one month of finishing the bootcamp, I found my first job offer as a UX/UI Designer. I highly recommend this bootcamp to all those committed to a career change!",coursereport

The idea was to add additional knowledge to my Arts studies and a Tech sales career in order to move closer to the product and be the voice of the customer at the business. The course was absolutely hands-on and intensive. We went through every step of the design process, thinking, and all approaches one can have. There was a lot of freedom for creativity in terms of design, but strong product and research learnings. 100% recommend taking this course, plan your time wisely as you really need to invest a lot of it in learning and working and developing your sills, but its all worth it and transforms you into a Jr UX designer.",coursereport

34,Ironhack,2022-11-30,"I enrolled in Ironhack's Cybersecurity Bootcamp with a programming/technical background, but it is perfectly designed for career changers (the pre-work covers everything you need to get started) From my perspective, the best thing about the bootcamp was the instructors (Jochen and Daute, in my case) who were also working professionals. They assumed nothing and covered everything at a reasonable pace, providing additional resources if needed. The curriculum generally spent more time on defensive (blue team) learning than offensive (red team), probably to match the industry’s overall demands. Also, the career service coaches really help you to prepare for the interviews throughout the job search process. In my opinion, it would add a lot of value to the bootcamp to prepare us for one of the main entry-level cybersecurity certifications (CompTIA Security+, CEH, GSEC...), as they are internationally recognized and demanded in almost all job descriptions.",coursereport

39,Ironhack,2022-08-02,"Terrible material, they have this online platform with what is supposed to be an addition to what you learn in class with information that could be easily found on the internet with an even more in-depth explanation. The staff is awful, it takes very long to answer emails and if you communicate an issue to them they are in my experience, extremely condescending. The teacher that led the online course was very unprepared, the lesson consisted mainly of him talking and using slideshows it wasn't interactive at all, and the teacher's English level and technical level was, in my opinion, not adequate enough to teach. The only good thing is that they provide you with exercise martial, but you could access very similar coding exercises through online katas. They don't provide any specific help with careers and I know many of the people that did the Bootcamp had difficulty finding a job, just have a look on Linkedin.",coursereport
40,Ironhack,2022-03-10,I was very interested in the Data Analytics Bootcamp. After long research I decided to go with Ironhack and applied. I've been contacted with someone named Ariana Quintana to have a meeting and assist me in my application. The application began smothly but slowly turned down hell when I started asking about the course and curriculum. She was very rude and said why are you asking about Tabloue? didn't you read our Syllabus? if you are interested stuyding Tablou you shouldn't have contacted us because we don't teach it. I told her but is in the Syllabus ! and questioning my intelgiance by not reading the Syllabus. eventually she saw Tablou written in the Syllabus and said I don't know why it's there but we don't teach it. At the end I had enough with this employee and her attitude and told her I am no longer interested in attending your school ! she said well we don't want people like you too. Then asked her please to no longer send me the assisment test and hanged the meeting.

41,Ironhack,2021-09-12,"Dear Leadies and Gentelmen, I will share with you my terrible experience with Ironhack hoping that it will be useful to you and that you will not make the mistake I made. I also read a lot of reviews and saw very few negative ones, even ignoring them thinking that these were just exceptions, people who did not want to learn something new. But now I know they were people telling the truth. I don't want to offend anyone, I just see Ironhack as a service provider and I evaluate it as I see it. So let's begin! 1. The Teacher – Ignacio Soretas He can't speak English properly! He has a hard time understanding what we said, of course, I understand that English is not his mother language, but this is not just about pronunciation, it’s about the word combination he uses. He just lacks the ability to explain, to express himself correctly. Also, if you ask him a question, either verbal or written, he cannot understand what you are asking him, he cannot answer the question. It happened very often we asked him the same question in 1283091238901 different ways, just to understand what we are asking him and he again either says that he does not understand the questions or starts talking nonsense. Things that have nothing to do with the question. Example: Question: Hey Ignacio, how to clean this data? Answer: It’s very important to clean your data. OR I don't understand what you're asking ################################################################################################# It flows from topic to topic. Very often while talking about one topic he turns to another or goes back explaining some things he forgot to say, but we talked about them 2 hours ago and now he remembered to say them. Let me give you a similar example that will help us understand what I mean. Let's imagine that we have a task to cook a pizza. I guess most of the people reading this post know how to cook pizza and that's why I chose this example. Here's how Ignacio Soretas would explain how to cook a pizza. Example: Once you bought the dough from the store now roll it out and start making a pizza, then Michael Jackson was a very famous singer of the time, I forgot to tell you that he had no children, take the pizza out of the oven and eat. This was an example that contained words and objects that are close to our daily lives. It was easy to detect the catch, but now imagine he is talking about stuff you hear for the first time like data analysis, statistics etc... It’s impossible to understand what he means, but he left you with confusion with many questions. ################################################################################################# 2. Curriculum The simplest and most basic things we all need to know we’re not explained. Things like how to create a table (Data Frame) in Pandas (Python library used to operate with data). How to fill this table with information. How to change the values in the table and other basic stuff. The biggest downside is that they didn't teach us to THINK like a data analyst, they didn't teach us how to ask questions and how to check them, through the data, how to clean data, and many many more. ################################################################################################# Also, the exercises we had to do were not well structured and are not suitable for beginners. Task descriptions are very bad, it is difficult to understand what they want from us even for a person who is a native English speaker. Very often the exercises included tasks that were not adequate for everyday life. Things that have nothing to do with us. Difficult to assimilate and thus further complicate the understanding of the task. For example, things like some Pokemons and similar cartoon characters. We had the task to process a table with the characteristics of Pokemon and draw conclusions about them. Like ‘Who is the strongest Pokemon?’. As you can guess for people who have never seen this cartoon and have no idea about Pokemon, the difficulty of the task increases. Once because you do not understand what information the table contains and second because you do not understand how the code work, with which you are trying to process the table. It would be much better if the exercises contained things that are much closer to the problems in real life, things that we encounter every day, such as tables with information about food and so on. ################################################################################################# The lectures were nothing more than reading aloud, and there was nothing of added value. Not to mention that there were days when the lectures lasted about 4-5 hours from 9 to 14:00 in the afternoon and after such a long listening nothing remains in your head. The information should be conveyed in small steps and at small intervals, not a lot of information together. ################################################################################################# Often they said to us that if we had questions we should ask Google or our teammates and if we failed then we would ask for help from the assistant or the teacher. Well, this brings us automatically to the question if I have to ask my classmates or Google then why did I pay you more than 7K euros? ################################################################################################# SQL is the number 1 required skill to find a job as a data analyst, well we learn it only for one week… but spend 3 weeks in ML doing something that nobody understands, and nobody will hire us to make a model that we don’t understand how they work. Tableau is the number 2 required skill to find a job as a data analyst but we learn it only one day! ONLY ONE DAY, yes you read right ONLY ONE DAY! ################################################################################################# 3. Job support is even worst. I will tell you only that few months later I can’t find a job in the analytics field, and I will end there, hopefully, I helped you to understand what are the hidden costs of taking a Bootcamp at Ironhack. ################################################################################################# Of course, there are many more bullshits around them but yea, that’s enough for now. As a summary! STAY AWAY from IRONHACK! STAY AWAY from IRONHACK! Go to Udemy, Coursera, etc… and remember Data Analytics isn’t a sprint it’s a lifelong journey!",coursereport
42,Ironhack,2021-04-20,"I enjoyed Ironhack's culture and the other students that were in the course, but the performance of our teacher and curriculum was simply not straightforward or clear. Halfway through of the Berlin's Full-time data analytics course, I withdrew from the course due to the confusion and lack of comprehensive lessons. With 7 years of data-analytics experience, I didn't think it would be confusing to understand the teacher, however it was simply painful going so fast-paced. For a course that was marketed to me with a strong focus in the curriculum, the pedagogy and pacing from the teacher didn't seem to work for me (or others in the class based on their complaints), as it often didn't make sense (i.e unnatural progression of lessons, class activities that didn't test you on the lesson just covered, or even questions that were badly written that it takes native-English speakers 10m to figure out what they're asking...) They did not use the online course features as much as they could have and relied on the teacher to provide all learnings. The teacher and the teaching assistants were very kind and did try to address my issues, however, the changes did not happen quick enough nor comprehensively. Due to Corona regulations, there may have been some consolidation of courses, which caused our class simply to be too big (about 29 students at the start, when I was told there would only be 15) - this with the fact that the teacher didn't field questions, or retained the focus of the module, questions from students (with diverse backgrounds and experience) often took the discussions to places that were not adequate for beginners. Perhaps I had bad timing and simply landed in a strange class since our original teacher had been replaced due to him getting Corona. However, Ironhack's performance has left me with a bitter taste in my mouth and I feel like they were simply a learning/teaching startup that grew too quickly to fulfill the needs of the students. They were going for quantity of students in their class not the quality of teaching/graduates. They're culture focused on ""staying positive"" and as great as this is, when providing criticism to the program director, they were focused mainly on ""actionable"" items - relying on solutions from the students, not from the teaching staff or administrative team. From those graduates that I still keep in touch with from my class, they have candidly mentioned that it wasn't the best experience for them either.",coursereport
43,Ironhack,2021-04-08,"During this bootcamp I learned so much in such a short notice, I never could do that with any self learning course. You learn very valuable skills you only learn by actually doing, trying, falling, rising and working together. No matter what your entry level is, the mentors always were sure you were not left behind and were very patient and willing to explain it until the whole class understood. I felt always very safe to ask any questions, which is very important to me. Instead of the bootcamp on location, I attent the remote cohort. At Ironhack they really know how to organized remote classes. It was a good balance between classes, tasks and self learning. Even remote, every one was always involved in the classes throughout the day. And there was no room for slacking :) , which I also very much like. Make sure you do not plan anything at all these three months. It will be 100% bootcamp which I was grateful for afterwards. Besides learning, we also build up a bond within the class. In the end it felt like friends that I still speak after the bootcamp was done. The Ironhack community is a big pro of (and after) the bootcamp. I thought about it for a long time, and just did it. I left comfortable en secure job for this bootcamp, and did not regret it at all.",coursereport
44,Ironhack,2020-07-02,"I am happy to confirm only after 5 weeks that Ironhack's method, as intense and brain wrecking as it is, is still the best approach to learning web programming there is. It is incredibly more effective and substantially better than any other approach I tried before (books, youtube self-learning, online courses, university programs, etc) to learn web development. One key factor is the amazing team of teachers that provide you with live assistance on the spot, right away. My only pain point has so far been: the learning materials on the student platform (the ones we use to do the lab exercises) have quite a few grammar and spelling mistakes, most probably because they were not written by a native English speaker. Nothing major that will stop you from understanding, is just a tad annoying. It is important for anyone interested in this or any other bootcamp to understand that doing the course is just the tip of a huge iceberg and is in no way a magic wand that will make you an amazing developer right after graduation, but it nevertheless takes you such a long long way, which is otherwise almost impossible to achieve in such a short time and in such an effective way. For anyone willing to really learn (once and for all) something so abstract and complex as Full Stack Web Development, especially if you have tried and failed before, this program is 100% worth it. From there you can continue the perhaps infinite loop process of becoming a better developer.",coursereport
45,Ironhack,2020-06-19,"I had an amazing experience at Ironhack. I finished the full-time web dev course in March 2020 in Berlin. The staff was amazing and I learned far more than I thought I would going into the program. I was a little nervous about my lack of experience as I had absolutely no coding background (I had never written one line of code prior to the course pre-work). I did not feel like I was left behind at all. My teacher and TA's were super helpful and really made sure everyone understood the course material. That said, you really have to do your part. If you put in the time to really understand the logic behind the code, you will be surprised how much you can learn in such a short time. I would recommend Ironhack to anyone looking to learn how to code.",coursereport

The pace is fast, but that's what you want when you're tackling a career change. It has to be fast, intense and with relevant information. Since I left the bootcamp I feel like I have super powers. Nothing is out of reach from me. THe team is amazing and the environment in class is outstanding",coursereport
48,Ironhack,2020-04-27,Joining Ironhack was the best decision for me as part of a career change I was doing (I came from a non-related field). Not only that I met great and supportive people (students and instructors) but I also got the set of skills and mindset I needed in order to enter this field and make my career change. The course was challenging and I learned a lot but at the same time so much fun.,coursereport
49,Ironhack,2020-04-27,"I couldn't be happier that I made the decision to enroll in the full-time web development program at Ironhack Berlin. I've worked in product design for about 8 years now, and it became more and more apparent how important it is to be technically adept to better collaborate with our engineers. I also wanted to have the freedom and competency to build my own ideas into tangible products! In these 9 weeks, we learned an up-to-date tech stack that enabled me to build my own products immediately and independently after graduation. I've tried learning coding via online courses such as Coursera, Udemy and Codecademy, but it really doesn't come close to an in-person, immersive course. The atmosphere at Ironhack also added to the experience - we had a super smart, patient and very well-structured teacher and our classmates were always so supportive of one another. All in all, a great experience and worth every penny.",coursereport

The staff, teachers and teaching assistants have a lot of energy and positivity and they managed to pass it down to us. The learning material was rich and clearly structured and included a very good balance between theory and practice. What I also found really helpful is the fact that there was no grading system, everyone could make up their own goals and decide how much they wanted to push themselves. I think that worked really well. There was a lot of support regarding career topics, like how to improve our CVs and how to do well in interviews. And most of us got some interviews and coding challenges through the internal hiring fair. Finally, it wouldn't have been such a great experience without the general feeling of community. Ironhack staff contributed a lot to that by organising some activities and hanging out for drinks now and then.",coursereport
53,Ironhack,2019-11-07,"I joined Ironhack UX/UI full-time design bootcamp after recommendation and many positive reviews I read on the Internet. It is imporant to notice here than Ironhack has many locations and for sure there is a lot of differences between them - actually it's hard to find them about this specific course in Berlin, so this is why I decided to write my opinion here. Maybe I will start from positive part here. The working environment it's really amazing, mostly due to the people who participate in the course. It's really great to work with people with different skills and with various background - everyone was very supportive, kind and helpful. When you are stuck with anything, you can always count on your classmates. Also, I think the curriculum is well constructed and contains the most imporant information - of course, it's super intense and it's not possible to remember everything from the lectures but you will get a forever access to the learning platform - pretty helpful. The cool building, comfortable chairs and the free barista were also big advantages :) Before joining the course, I studied carefully the info and details on their wbesites. For sure, Ironhack promises a lot and it's not suprising, beacuse the bootcamps are very expensive (and getting even more). I would like to refer here to some of their promises. First of all, the lead teacher is not a UX/UI designer, but a visual designer, and acutally he is not even really interested in the UX part and as he admitted, he has never really worked with it. I expected him to have a broad knowledge about UX, but it was pretty limited to the slides he was presenting. Also, he was very hardly accessible - he was usually leaving early or were always busy with something else. To be honest, he didn't seem really interested in the job. Ironhack presents itself as a team ""tech spec"" - but a lot of times they are just lacking skills. The teacher and TA are definetely not specialist in the sofwares that are used during the course - it's very dissapointing. During the career week, some invited people to the school seemed pretty random - maybe just to fill our time with something? I'm not sure if inviting a person who is an ex-TA who doesn't have a job yet as an ""interview specialist"" or doing negotiation workshops with a person who has no experience with it is the best idea... I think Ironhack should really take closer look at the people who they are hiring - both the teacher and TAs seem often unmotivated and not really engaged in their work. I understand they are not professional designers but sometimes their advice and knowledge is lower that the participants of the course. And also, complaining about students in the common areas, where everyone can hear it, is VERY unprofessional. Overall, I learned a lot during the course, but it was a lot of my individual work I put in it and also from people I ask for advice from - unfortunetely I can't say the staff was really helpful. I think that Ironhack is not a bad school, but for this price, people's expectations were way higher, what almost everyone admitted at the end. At the moment, I'd advice to think twice before joining campus in Berlin and maybe to consider different locations.",coursereport
54,Ironhack,2019-10-31,"I wanted to switch my career and learn coding and after considering a university degree and some coding bootcamps I talked to Ironhack and was convinced very quickly. I was looking for a learning environment among people as motivated and enthusiastic about web development as me. Ironhack provided me with such an environment, support from the best teachers and the necessary web development skills.I really enjoyed my time there, especially project weeks when we built professional websites in unbelievable 4 to 9 days. Another reason I joined Ironhack was because they promised me 95% chance of employment within 2-3 months after the graduation. They didn't lie! During their career week I met my current employer and got an offer one week later.

55,Ironhack,2019-08-31,"Doing the Web Development Bootcamp was the best decision I’ve ever made! Working in a fintech Start Up, made me that curious about the world of coding, until the point that I decided to change my careers. The Bootcamp from Ironhack was the perfect compact solution for my new orientation. The 9 weeks were a very intense time, most of the days I’ve been at the bootcamp for 10-12 hours. Since I prepared quite well with the precourse I didn’t have any difficulties in following up on the course, which anyhow was very challenging! The teachers and the assistants are great people and the whole Ironhack team are very lovely and open hearted. Through the hiring fair, I met a company that I would have never imagined been working for and I actually was able to more than double my income with this new job. So yeah, people might think the whole promises that Ironhack make seem to easy for restructuring your professional life, but it simply is that way. However you should be 100% sure that you love coding, because if not the 9 weeks will be hell. I recommend every body who found a new passion in coding to make this decision.

Ironhack was an amazing experience. It’s incredible how much we learned in those 9 weeks.I basically started with very little previous knowledge about coding and learned enough to be able to change careers. I’m not going to lie, it has been the most challenging 9 weeks of my life. So prepared, it won’t be easy. But if you’re motivated and able to push yourself, you can get a lot out of it. And even though you might be frustrated or stuck, there is always somebody around to help. The staff is amazing and everybody was super nice and patient.

I'd had a little experience coding in HTML and CSS before I started the course, but had no programming experience and only a little knowledge of how the internet works. The bootcamp really kicked my butt!! It felt the entire time that I was not keeping up as much as I'd have liked even though I was spending every waking hour learning as much as I could (i.e.: reviewing on the trains to and from the course, staying late to finish exercises, learning on the weekends...). I found that this was a pretty common feeling for a lot of people in the course, so you build great connections and help each other along the way. It was also essential that the teachers were so dedicated and supportive. It was my first introduction to how social coding could and should be. In the end, even though a lot of the content was over my head throughout the course, I found that I'd learned enough to land the software developer job I'd had my eyes on since before the bootcamp. I'll be working in various languages, so showing my newly-gained knowledge of Javascript was enough to prove that I will be able to learn and work in other programming languages as well. Advice for anyone starting the course (especially if you have no programming experience like me!): Do yourself a favour and spend as much time as possible with the pre-work! I wish I'd spent more time with the Javascript part, it ended up being harder than I'd expected to wrap my head around the basics and I kind of ran out of time before the course started. I'd recommend even supplementing the pre-work with tutorials so that you really have a good grasp of the basics that are introduced there. There are lots of great tutorials online, free and paid, I learn really well with teamtreehouse.com for example.

About me… I am an Industrial Engineer who worked at a “corp” as an executive data analyst (yay so much fun!). Although I’ve always enjoyed taking part in the creation of products people can use, so I was never happy with this job or career path I have chosen. I was first introduced to coding back in 2015 when I purchased a few online courses, it was then that I learned this is what I wanted to do for a living. After a few months of learning by myself I started applying for jobs only to be rejected by all of them. After this disappointing experience I stayed in the field I had a “degree” on and let the years pass by… Until my new years resolution from 2017-2018, I remember saying to myself “this is the year that I am changing this career path”. I started doing research on coding programs, masters, certificates, bachelors… everting! Until I was introduced to the bootcamps. Long story short after a few weeks of research, I joined Ironhack mainly because of their program, their reviews and the locations they have presence. Today, I am preparing for my relocation to Berlin, it took me 2 days after finishing the bootcamp to get a job offer from an amazing company (I met in the hiring week from Ironhack). And I am not the only student who got an offer soon after finishing the bootcamp (some even got offers while in the middle of the program!).

Surely it was difficult at times, but being surrounded by a a great team of students and instructors helps a lot. I came to Ironhack without hardly any knowledge of programming and nevertheless I was offered a job only halfway through the course!",coursereport
67,Ironhack,2018-09-10,"It was hard, but totally worth it. Ironhack gave me all the necessary knowledge and tools I needed. Now I know what I need to improve in my knowledge, how can I do it by myself and where to find all the related stuff.",coursereport
68,Ironhack,2018-09-07,"I just finished the Ironhack Full time Web development Bootcamp in Berlin where I learned to code real world applications using the MERN Stack. In those 9 intense weeks we learned everything we need to know in order to get employed as a Junior Developer. The Bootcamp was very intense, especially the first 2 weeks but it was always fun to learn and I became very close with the other students, even though they were decades older than me :) (I am currently 18). We usually all stayed in class from 9am to 8pm or sometimes even later to catch up on old lessons or exercises. The course material is very good and we have live long access to it. The career services Ironhack offers are also very helpful. A lot of the students got employed from one of Ironhacks Partners. Sometimes there were organizational problems but nothing major. Summarized the Bootcamp was one of the greatest decisions of my life. I can start my career as a developer right away, even though I don't have a College degree or an apprenticeship diploma. I also have the feeling I learned much more than just coding. My english and my interview skills for example improved a lot! I can definitely recommend it to everyone who is willing to put in some effort!!",coursereport
69,Ironhack,2023-04-08,"The classes were phenomenal, in my case my professor was outstanding, very patient and always glad to help anyone who needed it. As for the 2 TAs, one was better than the other, but they both still tried their hardest to help you in anything they want. So in the case of learning how to program (I did the web development bootcamp) it really was a nice experience where you learn a lot. Here comes my issues, the career service. They promised in their old website a really high chance to get a job after finishing their bootcamps (+90% of students found a job in less than 6 months supposedly), and they claim to have contacts with over 600+ companies, which does not really seem to be the case. The career service is only valid in my opinion so you can learn how to set up your LinkedIn, the rest of the stuff they organize/offer, is really not up to any kind of standards that you would expect, specially when they sell themselves in such a nice way, and for the cost, Id rather pay 50% just to go to class, and just skip the career service. They start bombarding you with e-mails, asking for job updates and what are you doing, and in my case, even after answering all of them, since I needed to find another job to sustain myself. I can not part-take in any of the events they organize even remotely in 99% of the cases, and seems like if you do not part-take in this kinda sect you are not welcome. So, finishing up, I would recommend that you go to another bootcamp if you just want to learn and want to avoid being sold smoke.",coursereport

71,Ironhack,2022-12-15,"The reason I went to a bootcamp was their connections with the companies and referrals. However, since months, there was no job offer/referral made from Ironhack. If I knew that, I would learn coding by myself and hire a private teacher to support me instead of giving that much money.",coursereport
72,Ironhack,2022-12-09,"After having worked in digital marketing for over 10+ years I wanted to expand my knowledge. Inspired by a friend, who switched careers, I also chose a bootcamp to acquire new skills. The 3 month remote UX UI bootcamp of Ironhack was work-intense, but helped me to get the skills, that are required on the job market. We had a very good lead teacher from Miami and theory lectures in the morning as well as practical sessions on Figma in the afternoons. The group work was challenging at some times, but it prepares you for your future workplace. It was really helpful to have a career week too, where they share all the insights on how to impress with your Linkedin profile & portfolio website. If you follow the steps of the bootcamp I think it's indeed possible to land a new job in this industry. My goal was to switch jobs after 6months if the graduation from the bootcamp- and this is exactly what happened. I got a better paid hybrid job in an international corporate within an ambitious team. If you are still doubting if it's the right fit for you, contact alumnis of Ironhack :)",coursereport
73,Ironhack,2022-12-06,"I found Ironhack while searching for a good UX/UI Design course. I started remote fulltime bootcamp without too many expectations, thinking how much can I even get out of this and how much is just marketing. I was sceptical about learning so much in such a short amount of time and on top of that remote! I have to say that with the right mindset and effort, Ironhack will guide you on every step of the way towards your dream career. The classes were intense but so enriching. I had an excellent and experienced Lead Teacher and Teacher Assistant that I am still in contact with. We were a small classroom of 11, which is pretty rare, and former classmates together with the teaching team created a great atmosphere. Curriculum-wise, we had few projects among which there were two projects with real life clients. We learned the fundamentals of UX/UI design and how to be independent at the end of the day and choose appropriate methods for each challenge. I had to skip a Career week, but I know that my former classmates had a great experience there as well. Altogether, I formed amazing connections with now fellow designers and some very close friendships, I learned a lot and I am now working in the field. :)",coursereport

The syllabus of the course really covers all the necessary knowledge and gives you the time you need to develop your project for your first portfolio which will help you to get that first job as a Software Engineer. The instructors were great and very helpful. They give us a lot of inside into the profession and give some good tips on how to direct our development even after the course ended. If you are decided to make the step into coding I can recommend you this course.",coursereport

78,Ironhack,2022-11-28,"Look elsewhere. If you want to actually learn what you need to know to get a career, choose a different boot camp. My instructor was not an actual teacher and teaching was his side gig. I didn't learn anything useful for UI there is no job guarantee. I do not know of any past students that went on to actually have a career in what they went to school for. Ironhack is a huge scam. They will take your money and run.",coursereport
79,Ironhack,2022-11-27,"Technically, not a scam. But it really feels like it is.. the course has 36 students or more, they told me it would be like 15 or so in the beginning.. the teachers are extremely inexperienced and not prepared... friendly but not helpful. They are pretty much graduates from this course who turn to... teacher... HOW?? so many people are very unhappy. Please, do yourself a favor, and choose another bootcamp.",coursereport
80,Ironhack,2022-06-07,The whole content is something I could have learnt myself online. The teacher was amazing but the company overall lacked communication and over sold the bootcamp. The campus is great but the price of the bootcamp is overpriced.,coursereport
81,Ironhack,2021-10-07,"I wouldn't tell you to believe anything they tell you in the selection interview, their networking in some countries is 0. Don't choose them for the networking, career week is very basic and I was promised in the interview that they would help me in the country I was in and they have no idea about the market. The quality of study is very fast, it's not because it's a bootcamp, I did two and at Ironhack they save a lot on teachers, they would need at least 3 TA's and they have 1. The reviews on GitHub are fast, you can apply to jobs with a horrible GitHub and not know it, you leave without knowing how to make a good GitHub. Personally I complained and they ignored me and now that I have a job they write to me to use me as an example and publicity, many people who come out as an example of success in Ironhack did not get help from Ironhack. It is very expensive for what they offer. The career week is about making your CV and very basic things, we didn't improve our GitHub, there was no networking and they didn't help us at all to make a portfolio, I don't recommend it.",coursereport
82,Ironhack,2021-01-22,"If you are going to pay for this course with your savings I recommend you not to do it!!! If it is paid by Job-center totally recommended (So try to get job centers to help to pay it.) Reasons why the price is too high for what they offer: - One reason is what Ironhack promises they don't deliver. - Ironhack just teaches you the very basics. If you are applying for a job you might encounter a Test where you don't know what to do because Web Development is such a wide area that you will find a lot of stuff that of course, you will not cover in the course. Things that they don't teach you and are very important in the industry are for example SQL, GraphQL, React Hooks, Redux and Typescript. - Fast Track Interviews (FTI) are not reliable. I have gotten some matches but with unprofessional companies and some not even a Web Developer position. (and of course, most of the companies don't even answer). So don't rely on them for looking for a job because I am already since 6 months without a job applying like crazy everywhere. - Nevertheless are still people in my batch that found jobs, some by contacts and some (like 3 and we were 15) in a hard way, some did already had jobs and stayed in their position. The ones that found a job in a hard way were by opportunities (that they mentioned as luck) but luck is also an important factor to find a job. But of course, after paying that amount of money by yourself you feel left alone. - Ironhack does offer workshops for Redux and Typescript but again they cost you extra money (approx 215€). - The teachers were very good and amazing the only reason I had fun programming and started this journey. #PeaceOut Hope you find my honest review helpful! (Helpful reminder is that they don't give any refunds and if you drop out they charge you the weeks you were in the course)",coursereport
83,Ironhack,2020-11-28,Lack of professionalism through and through. Teacher assistants are not experienced nor capable enough to be help. Not worth the money. Learnt more by myself on YouTube.,coursereport
84,Ironhack,2020-10-13,"After finishing on 25 July my Bootcamp I was very excited to finally get in contact with some companies. I did my career week as any normal student and they told us to read the material in the middle of the zoom meeting, which was a waste of time since you could read the material at home and not use 3 hours zoom meeting. After some days I found out that we would only get in contact with companies after 3 months. They said their new FTI is even better than the quick interviews they provided before... So I matched with two companies two weeks ago but of course one of the companies was only looking for Product Developer (nothing to do with web development) and the other one was a CEO that I sent an email to, of course, did not reply. When I asked about it they told me to be patient... Here is the thing I have been waiting already for 2 months and a half, I was counting on Ironhack to find a job because I am on a work-seeker Visa and they have failed me. I asked for a refund since the course also did lose their quality going online and also did not get anything. If you are looking for a job Ironhack is not enough since most of the companies use other technologies like PHP, SQL, or GraphQL things you don't learn in this course, search for it online and you will see no companies use MongoDB very few of them does. Think twice before paying a huge amount of money since it will not guarantee you a job position. From 15 persons that graduated our batch only two that I know got jobs because they had contacts. The teacher was very good and professional the only thing that might be worst to pay but not 7500 euros.",coursereport
85,Ironhack,2020-04-27,"I have a design background and I've never coded before I started Ironhack. I had an amazing experience during the Bootcamp, with a great content structure and staff support. The teacher was incredible, one of the best that I've had. I've not just learned how to code in Javascript but also how to learn other languages by myself. After two months that I've completed the Bootcamp, I started to work at the developer field.",coursereport
86,Ironhack,2020-04-14,"I feel obligated to write a review for this course because I have very mixed feelings about the experience. I will try to be as honest as possible. Before the course starts, students must complete prework assignments based off an online learning platform. The platform was a good start but didn’t always provide all necessary information or enough examples to completely understand the material. The TAs are available to help, but in my experience they didn’t always get back to me right away (I later learned why—the TAs are extremely overworked). The prework needs improving because there’s no good way to accurately see if you’ve learned enough before the course starts, even by completing the two assignments. As for the course itself: class was from 9-18:00 but if you’re taking it seriously, you’ll stay several extra hours to complete the lab assignments. It’s lots of self-learning. The website is accurate in its structure of the day, with lectures and labs interspersed. They’re good at giving you lots of breaks, which you’ll need. The TAs are amazing and work hard to help you, sometimes sitting down for long periods of time to debug your code. Personally I think they did more than the teacher and deserve more pay/credit. On the other hand, the fact that TAs can help you whenever and assignments are often done with partners, it’s hard to know if you truly understand the material. You might be completing assignments after receiving help from others, so it’s hard to gauge whether you’ve comprehended it all. Personally I felt like my TAs coded my entire first project because I didn’t understand any of it, while the feedback from the TAs was very positive. I therefore felt there was a huge discrepancy because they couldn’t truly see how people were doing. When I tried to advocate for myself, they always just told me I was doing fine. The projects overall are a great way to break into a new career. You’ll learn a lot and add to your portfolio. Additionally, you’ll do 1-2 daily labs, mini projects, so you’ll build up a good foundation. After the bootcamp I think learning online would be impossible. IH barely scratches the surface of what a developer needs to know (just because it can’t in such a short time), and to learn the same amount without a bootcamp would take years, especially without help from peers. On the other hand, I personally think IH isn’t the right bootcamp anymore. Perhaps it once was, but its career services leave something to be desired (in the case of my class: a career). Our hiring week took place right before Christmas, so it might as well not have happened, as no one hires then anyway. After that, we received only a couple emails within the three months after graduating, not nearly enough compared to the services promised. They also weren’t overly available for meetings so scheduling usually wasn’t instantaneous, and my meetings were short and seemingly unproductive. They told me things I already know. More frustrating is the fact that of all the people in my class looking for a new job, only a small number got hired within those three months, probably well below a 50% hiring rate, or even 30%. I don’t want to give a solid number but can say that the majority of students looking for a job from my class still has not found one. Overall, a bootcamp may or may not be a good decision, but for the financial and physical and mental health costs, IH is not the best choice.",coursereport

The whole team really creates a positive and supportive learning atmosphere, so you never feel embarrassed to ask a question or ask for help when you're struggling. And in the end everyone celebrates everyone else's achievements in the projects and job hunt! I got two job offers within two weeks of finishing the course. I took a job in Vienna with a starting salary of €42K annually plus benefits and a relocation bonus. This course really empowered me to believe in myself as a coder and change from a career where I felt very stuck, undervalued, and unhappy.",coursereport
90,Ironhack,2019-05-17,My experience was quite different. The cohort in Berlin seems quite unorganised and lacks basic communication.

The group projects, coding challenges, and live demos created a strong sense of community and collaboration, even in an online format. The bootcamp was intense but rewarding. It taught me not only technical skills like Python, SQL, and data analysis but also how to think like a problem-solver and work as part of a team.

The teachers are very well prepared and with very strong technical skills. The learning experience is very well supported through Le Wagon's learning platform and the guidance and support of the teachers and the TA's . It finishes with a 2-week team project where one can practically apply the concepts and skills acquired throughout the Bootcamp. Le Wagon also offers top job search services upon successful completion of the Bootcamp as well as networking platforms for their alumni. The batches are small 10-20 people, which gives you more time for personal coaching and 1 on 1 meetings with the teachers to discuss newly learned concepts or difficulties that have aroused.

Working in the daily assigned pairs also really helped me reach out for help from my peers and get to know other people's strengths and weaknesses. I felt like there was a good balance of checking in and independence so on days I struggled, getting help was very easy, and on the days I found it easy I could just work through and help out my partner if something came up.

I had no other option but doing the part time online course, because I could not afford stopping working and I live too far away from a campus to do a live part time. So for me this was the best option. Even though it was online, I found friends which hopefully I will be able to keep in touch with. I wish I could have done it face to face, but again, it was not a possibility for me and I still enjoyed the course. The teachers were really good and helpful. I liked the challenges as well. My background is in Data Analytics, so I had some experience working with Data. But the Engineering part was new to me, and I learnt a lot. I also realize than more than the tools themselves I am able to understand the concepts and apply the logic to any work situation I am presented with.

133,le wagon,2024-03-30,"The course was intense in terms of learning so much in so little time, but I knew this going in to the course. I really enjoyed the experience regardless of this, and loved learning so many new skills with a subject I like and have interest in. I had a lot of fun and laughs, and actually wish it was a little longer or that we could do it all again because I loved it so much - I actually feel sad it's now over!! I think the staff were probably my favourite part of the whole bootcamp, there weren't any teachers I didn't like. The course content was kept engaging by them and I had a lot of laughs. Most came across as relatable and lectures and livecodes weren't boring or dull. There were a few topics I wish we could've spent more time learning in more depth, for example more on how to write tests or a bit more time on javascript (although this was covered - I'd just like to have learnt more to gain a deeper understanding myself!) but I don't think it could've been fit in to the current course length, it would need to be longer to be able to do this. For the short time, I still feel so much was covered and I've learnt so much. I'm really surprised with how much I was able to learn, and how far I've come in so little time. In those first few weeks I never would have thought I'd have managed to achieve what I did during project weeks, let alone act as the lead developer overseeing the team and both practice and final projects!! My confidence in my abilities has increased hugely over the course, and the teachers and TA's also helped with that and validating that I did understand correctly when I had doubts. Overall I'm actually going to miss the bootcamp where I enjoyed it and had so much fun (even with how tiring it also was!!). I've only just finished the bootcamp and next week there's been a career week set up for us to help with next steps for getting a job, so I can't currently give a fair review on this part yet.

Reflecting on the experience, I'm extremely proud with how far myself and my group have come. While the bootcamp had its share of highs and lows, completing it fills me with immense pride. I often thought of it as the Navy Seals' 'Hell Week,' as it truly pushed me, while being intensive and demanding, stretching my abilities in ways I hadn't imagined. But this would have not been possible if it was not for the guidance of the teachers and the camaraderie of my fellow students throughout the program and I am deeply grateful for that. Their unwavering support was instrumental in navigating the challenges we faced together.

Being surrounded by a supportive team and other people sharing the same struggles (and achievements!) is definitely something that was beneficial to me.

I was having difficulty finding a job in the field I studied, mainly because I was not very passionate about it. I knew I wanted to shift toward Data Science or Analytics and so I started looking for boot camps. Le Wagon was top of the list and highly rated so I chose that one! I felt very nervous at first and had a bad case of imposter syndrome. However, within the first week I felt excited and empowered to learn new things. The teachers and staff were diverse, knowledgeable, and excellent teachers. The complete access to one-on-one sessions with professors through the ticket system is extremely valuable! Have a question or are stuck? Click the ticket button and in minutes you have an industry expert looking at your problem one-on-one. Also, the curriculum and lessons are rigorously and thoughtfully planned out to ease anyone into Data - from working with Google Sheets to exploring a variety of ELT tools; from data warehousing to writing SQL queries; and from applying statistics to training Machine Learning models - I learned so much!!

Over the two months, I acquired valuable skills, and the support from the instructors was unwavering. I particularly appreciated the small activities provided to help students relax, allowing us to manage the high-pressure learning environment effectively.

169,le wagon,2023-09-21,"This was 9 intense weeks, and I enjoyed almost all the study. I think this is typical length for a bootcamp, maybe because making it longer would be prohibitively expensive. But I finished feeling I still have a long way to go. I think that's normal with such bootcamps - I did a web development one many years ago that was 12 weeks and still felt the same on completion - so maybe no duration would ever be enough. Perhaps they could offer optional extra weeks? On the course structure: I think the topics were generally well-chosen and well taught, and the teaching assistants were wonderful. I would have preferred a slightly higher hands-on to lecture ratio, though that can be hard for a bootcamp to sell, since it feels like as a student you're somehow getting less for your money. But getting stuck and overcoming the obstacles is where 90% of the learning happens. It's also worth mentioning that the job market for data science grads seems possibly a lot smaller and at least a lot more complex than for web development grads, so if you're looking for the shortest path to a transition into tech, my initial impression is that latter (which Le Wagon also offer) is probably a better choice. To do this course, you should be prepared for a lot of post-course networking, rejection, while juggling further study with the need to send out enough job applications. So be sure this is what you want to do - but if it is, I think this is a very good way of getting started.",coursereport
170,le wagon,2023-09-20,"TL;DR: I highly recommend the Data Analytics bootcamp to anyone who needs to professionally analyze data and wants to become a Data pro. This bootcamp is suited for everyone who wants to professionally analyze data, you DO NOT need any prior experience doing data stuff beforehand. The bootcamp is a structured experience that takes you from Zero to Hero if you put the necessary time and effort into it. I know its quite a lot of money, but it really pays off. You get to learn everything you need to become a (Junior) Data Analyst and companies recognize the degree due to Le Wagon's reputation. On the first day of the bootcamp, you immediately get access to Le Wagon's alumni Slack community and can already start connecting with others. This is especially helpful once you start the job search because job opportunities are posted in their respecting Slack channels. This allows you to directly contact the person hiring or at least someone inside the company who can point you into the right direction or even provide a referral. Highly recommend the online bootcamp because it allows you to receive the same amount of education and new skills AND you do not need to commute each day. Overall, great experience which I can highly recommend!",coursereport

It is sooooo rewarding. It is not a rollercoaster, I love rollercoaster and I don't feel push around by them, it was more of a ride through hell and back but with a very very very rewarding ending. And apparently hell is very fun! Really it's a great way to spend time, energy and money. The staff is great, the teachers are great, very experienced and you can talk easily to anyone, even if you don't feel ok.

184,le wagon,2023-07-05,"Excellent experience! In fact, I was ready for even more intense work. But the overall impression was excellent. Excellent SQL lectures and challenges; Good overview of cloud storage systems with google cloud; ETL and data pipeline basics were linked to handy tools like dbt and airbyte; BI tools, Power BI and Looker studio. In my opinion, a bit too much time was dedicated to the easiest part of the course. But I understand the decision as the Looker Studio is a free tool while Power BI has licenses; Python!! I entered the course knowing nothing and I left loving it and using it a lot! They can make Python easy to understand and a practical tool for fast analysis. Teachers and Teacher assistants: For a group of 32 students, there were always a minimum of 6, sometimes more. So you can count on support all the time. Sometimes you may feel that a TA does not know a lot about the topic you are asking, but they will usually help you to discover what you need and find a solution. Do not expect to have the right answers to everything and be taken by the hand like you are in kindergarten!! They will teach you how to learn by yourself, how to research, how to look for answers, and how to read the documentation. Remember that after the course you will be alone in the world so they prepare you to take care of yourself.",coursereport
185,le wagon,2023-06-30,"It's been a joy to dedicate 11 weeks to expanding my knowledge at Le Wagon's Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp. The bootcamp itself lasts 9 weeks, but there's an optional very helpful week of Python prep before it starts and another optional very helpful career week once you've graduated. Full disclaimer: I didn't have to pay for bootcamp, it was completely subsidised by the German government, so my review should be taken with a pinch of salt because I didn't commit several thousands of euros of my own savings into this endeavour. That being said, many of my classmates did, and they left pretty satisfied with their investment. The amount of content you'll somehow manage to process in only two and a half months is pretty insane. Le Wagon runs a rather tight ship when it comes to organisation, on-site as well as online (I started by attending the bootcamp in Berlin then moved to online halfway through, so I can speak for both setups). Some teachers are outstanding, capable of taking the world's most complicated aspect of neural networks and explaining it to a 5-year-old, and some others, unfortunately not yet. But the structure of the course is such that even if the TA isn't yet very skilled in terms of didactic, you'll be perfectly fine: there's tons of support in case you have any questions, both from your classmates and from a group of TAs that's available to the class once the day's lecture is over. Overall, I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to hop on the ChatGPT wagon and move into the AI space.",coursereport

190,le wagon,2023-06-28,Frankly speaking I was a bit afraid that the bootcamp is only 2 months but in the end it seems enough. They give us the core understanding of the matter and even sometimes the newest trends. With these skills and knowledge it would be easy to develop further. The career week is also useful and full of insights. Do not think that this is a pill to get a job - the job search is not an easy task for a beginner after any kind of education but the fact is that you will be able to use your knowledge of data science to do projects. A chance to realize your own project is great. The choice of used tools in setup is nice. The coding part of the course (python week it's called?) was especially great. The data science tools used are also useful. But be aware that you have to code and understand code. So some sort of technical propensities is a must have imo. If coding is not as exiting maybe you should consider data analyst bootcamp. Overall it was a positive experience and I've enjoyed it.,coursereport

201,le wagon,2023-04-20,"As a person with a background in digital project management, but without any previous coding experience, this 9-week course brought me to my limits more than once. Yes, it is energetically and emotionally very challenging. But... the support, both from Le Wagon teachers and later the experience of working together in teams on your own project was just outstanding. It took me about 2-3 weeks to get used to the high pace + that constant feeling of being overwhelmed with all the new information every day. There was no real time to revisit topics. ""Trust us, we know what we're doing. If you're overwhelmed, look back one day and realize what you've learned since."" - This was probably the best advice which I want to pass on. But why 5 stars? - Because every aspect of the organization, the curriculum, the teacher encouragement and support up to the the feeling of constantly growing in my technical and creative skills was simply an experience unlike anything else. This is education at its best! I was challenged, encouraged, challenged, encouraged - I had a strong feeling the Le Wagon staff are on my side and really want me to succeed, despite self-doubts I had from time to time. Looking back at these 9 weeks, I feel very grateful. Not only have I learned a ton of Web Development skills to start my career as Junior Web Developer.

Be prepared to spend a lot of time studying, watching lecture videos, live sessions and solving challenges. I dedicated every free hour I had, over the course of 6 months. It will be intense, it will be stressful and it will be a rollercoaster ride. But you will survive it and it will be worth it. The most rewarding thing was completing this bootcamp. If you struggled to complete self-paced courses and kept giving up, then after this course you will have so much more confidence on your new skills that you can carry on learning more.

211,le wagon,2023-04-01,"""I had an amazing experience with LeWagon! As someone with zero coding knowledge, I was initially worried about being able to keep up, but the prep work helped ease me into things. While there were some outdated elements, I understand that keeping up with technology can be challenging. The programming environment set up in the first module was a cool and chill introduction. The second module focused on Ruby, starting with basics and progressing to more complex topics. It was a medium level of difficulty, but with consistent effort, I was able to push through. Object-Oriented Programming was my favorite subject, but it was also the most challenging. I learned about connecting objects, variables, classes, controllers, view pages, modules, routes, and all the 'behind the scenes' work before delving into Rails. The DB module was easy and fun, with a focus on manipulating, collecting, and saving data. The front-end module was a nice change of pace, where I could see my work come to life in the browser. I enjoyed styling and designing pages, and it felt great to see the results. Finally, the magic happened in the Rails module, where everything came together through the framework. The project work in a team was intense, but ultimately satisfying, culminating in a final app presentation. The teachers were the best part of the experience - they were simply amazing mentors. I don't want to forget anyone by naming names, but the whole team was just fantastic. Overall, my 6-month journey with LeWagon was an honest and rewarding experience.

214,le wagon,2023-03-17,"I could not express how disappointed I am at the very end of this boot camp. Before I paid for this boot camp, I was fascinated by the tons of good comments from different platforms, but after the start of the batch, I was shocked by its way of instruction. Previously I thought the courses were given live online. Still, all the courses regarding different topics are pre-recorded and you have to go through all the materials alone and finish the challenges after the lecture. This way of learning is very unfriendly to beginners and highly depressing and frustrating. Although they claim to have TAs to answer your questions, they are only available for a set period of time, and you have to wait for a long time to get some confusing answers which you could figure out the solutions to by googling (Now thanks to ChatGPT, you could get the answer for free immediately from OpenAI). As for their challenges, some functions and expressions used to solve them are not mentioned at all in the recordings, which means you need to spend extra time searching for the hints. My suggestion for those who consider registering for this program is to learn from those fantastic free resources on the YouTube channel. Those professors and coders from top world universities and tech giants explain the terms and algorithms much better and clearer than those half-amateurs and TAs who are only good at pushing you to finish the challenges. During this boot camp, I got extremely frustrated. Finally, I gave up learning by copying and pasting the code from the answers to deal with urges from those TAs who really don’t care about whether you have really understood and learned something at all. Ironically, right now, I learn happily and gradually, finding my confidence back from the Data Camp from which the cheat sheets given to students by their instructors come, and their cost is only 1/600 of this terrible boot camp. This awful boot camp definitely doesn’t worth that high price. With the help of ChatGPT and Google, I definitely believe there remain many much better choices than this one. Don’t spend your precious time and money on this program to torture yourself.",coursereport

Really, the teachers al all there to lift your spirits when it gets more difficult and this experience is quite life changing, literally! I finished Le Wagon with solid friendships, connections and skills, and I found a job before even finishing the course! I'm so glad I went for it and I didn't give up when I felt like maybe I wasn't made for this, and it's all thanks to the amazing teachers and Le Wagon.

217,le wagon,2022-12-21,"I had the chance to come into this bootcamp after having already completed an associate's in Computer Science, but I really needed the practical experience of building projects that could be used, not just solving programming exercises. Le Wagon definitely provided that and the opportunity to code/learn with others which is invaluable. The TAs are all Le Wagon graduates (which helps Le Wagon's post-graduation employment % numbers), but if you are having trouble getting hired as a developer, it is a great way to continue building upon your skills and for students, these TAs are knowledgeable enough to make a BIG difference in your learning journey. And many of them are already working as developers, so they can share their real-world experience with us. Many students come in with little to no programming knowledge and at the end of our bootcamp, everyone was able to submit an impressive functioning web app. I would absolutely do this again (even thinking about the data science & machine learning modules) and recommend Le Wagon to anyone who is on the fence about bootcamps. As an aside, I chose the part-time remote option because I work full-time. I honestly think I got more out of the part-time schedule because it allowed me time to digest and understand the lectures and exercises while doing extra outside work to learn more.

A fulfilling and caring atmosphere that pushes you to do your best and collaborate in an international environment with students from all over the world.The programme is extensive and includes coding on Python, data sourcing (SQL, API, CSV, web scrapping), data visualisation, data analysis, mathematics, decision science, data science (machine learning with unsupervised learning, NLP, time series, deep learning), even a short data engineering section (Train at Scale, Cloud Training, Predict in Production, User Interface), and of course a final real data science project to create and learn how to collaborate with the different specific skills of teammates. A Career Week is also offered to support, encourage, and help us to create a CV, a portfolio, and an attractive Linkedin Profile, with lots of job meetings to prepare proposed.The pace is very intense and requires good preparation in Python coding, algebra, statistics and the virtual environment, offered by the bootcamp a few weeks before the start of the course.",coursereport
226,le wagon,2022-10-03,I did the Le Wagon - Web Development full-time bootcamp which is 9 weeks. The Instructors were amazing at explaining the curriculum in a clear concise(frequently down-to-earth) way. The curriculum is packed with information but is broken down in a way that I felt was understandable and relatively easy to follow. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone that is trying to break into the programming industry.,coursereport
227,le wagon,2022-10-02,"Over the past few years I have completed a number of courses (mainly for my previous career as a language teacher), but none have had the quality that Le Wagon offers and taught me so much in such a short time. My experience with Le Wagon's remote course was worth every penny, without a shadow of a doubt. Although it was online, I can’t imagine having a better syllabus with more supportive and knowledgeable staff. The highlight was the collaborative nature of the programme. Every day, we had a buddy with whom we could discuss the days challenges, and during the final three weeks, we built two projects in a team of four. This is what makes Le Wagon unique. The teachers and teaching assistants were brilliant. They were very knowledgeable, encouraging and made the lessons fun and engaging, and ensured that everyone was keeping up with the pace. For those who struggled in the first few weeks, they did a great job of giving them extra help. As a previous teacher myself, I can definitely say that they genuinely care about their students' success and know what they're doing. Whereas some other bootcamps guarantee a job at the end of the programme, I have no doubt that Le Wagon was the best way to prepare me for a career in web development. I am confident that I have skills necessary to get a junior position, and after one week, I have already been offered a temporary internship. Finally, it was so much fun (especially the coding tournaments!) and I met some amazing people who I'm sure I will stay in touch with. Le Wagon is great at building a community, which people stay a part of way after the end of the bootcamp.",coursereport

They also support you in general, they have done this bootcamp and they know the struggles that come with the bootcamp and know how to comfort you when times are tough. There's no grading system which takes some of the pressure off and also motivates you to be better for yourself. This course is intense. It can be overwhelming if you don't make it your main focus for the 9 week duration. So stress can surface especially if haven't learnt in a while.

It felt like there was a brick-wall stopping me from getting over the first few hurdles no matter how much I tried. From day 1 at Le Wagon I had the full support of my class-mates, Teaching Assistants, Teachers, and everyone else. The sense of community is unrivalled. Not only was I pushed through my block, I am now at a point where I have a defined understanding of how all realms in computer-science come together in ensemble.

242,le wagon,2022-07-21,"Before I joined Le Wagon I studied economics and was working as an economic researcher, doing mostly qualitative stuff and a bit of Excel. I was unhappy with the low level of data analysis I was doing (and the lacking experience to dig deeper). I choose Le Wagon after searching for Bootcamps in Berlin because Le Wagon was on-site rather than full remote. Getting in contact with other students was a real plus from my perspective. The buddy system (you work with a different buddy each day) helped a lot to clear up questions and reduce anxiety. Also, the Teaching Assistants were helpful in that matter. After if graduated from Berlin batch #814 I was job searching for three months and I am now starting as a BI consultant. The Bootcamp was a good starting point for my career switch to a data role. It teaches a solid understanding of the ELT process as well as machine learning and deep learning algorithms. However, what I found most interesting was the Decision Science week where we went through all steps from exploratory data analysis, developing our own hypotheses to presenting these hypotheses. In hindsight, the business applications could be clearer at some point, but that's probably due to the focus on Data Science instead of Data Analytics. For me, the Bootcamp was a good starting point to get a feeling of data-business processes and understand what my next steps should be. The community is a plus too, as many alumni worldwide are happy to get in contact and answer some questions. And the Career Week held some useful information about job search after the Bootcamp.",coursereport

But this was basically more copy, pasting, and adapting stuff I found on the internet. Luckily, Le Wagon gave me the toolset I needed to build my own applications from scratch and speed up my development game. Now I'm able to build my own apps, which is great. I guess I could have learned it on my own as well, but this would have taken way more time. So overall amazing experience and I do not regret joining Le Wagon at all. I would do it again. So I can highly recommend it. Even if you do not want to build your own web applications, Le Wagon really helps you to understand how tech companies are actually working and to be able to talk through requirements with internal and external stakeholders.",coursereport
246,le wagon,2022-07-19,"Nothing in life is perfect – that also goes for bootcamps like Le Wagon. Of course, a course schedule could always be more optimized, instructors could always be even more knowledgeable, etc. But the important thing is not to be perfect, but to “get the job done”, i.e. preparing people with little to zero coding skills for breaking into a tech career, and Le Wagon does that excellently! Sure, the instructors and teaching assistants may not always immediately know everything – but they are always 100% dedicated to helping you and finding the solution together! Which is actually close to how professional developers work: it’s not about always knowing everything, but getting into a mindset of “there is a solution, let’s make it work!” In the end, there was always a solution found, and learning to adapt this kind of mindset was actually one of the most valuable parts. I’m sure there could be adjustments made to the curriculum – as a lot of reviews mention, it is a bit light on JavaScript and frontend in general, and sometimes I would have wished for a bit more context to the topics we were learning. But again: the important thing is that while I had no knowledge before, I now feel like I have a firm knowledge of the basics that will enable me to keep learning on my own. I also feel like they do a rather good job of preparing you for the “life after”, with resources, recommendations for potential job options and paths, and a whole network of people in the tech scene you can reach out to for advice (or who will reach out to you with job opportunities). Tips to get the most out of it: Apply early enough, so you have time to do the extensive version of the preparation materials. Students in my course who applied shortly before the start had to complete fewer online preparation courses. But the more preparation you do, the better your start into the bootcamp will be! Take the schedule seriously: there is not much time to revise stuff or even slack off, as every day you learn completely new stuff. So get up early, go to campus, pay attention during the lecture. If you can, take the evening to revise and even look at the materials from the next day. This sounds hard – and it is – but if you stick to this, it will be all the more rewarding. Most important tip: talk to the instructors often! While it’s fun to try and solve the daily challenges on your own, you do learn the most by talking to them. A lot of the knowledge is not conveyed in the lecture (as there is just so much to learn), but rather you’re supposed to gain it from doing the challenges while talking to your fellow students and the teachers / teaching assistants. Remember: you are supposed to ask for help not know/do it all by yourself! So if you put in the work and motivation, the Le Wagon web dev bootcamp will definitely reward you with that “life-changing experience”! :)",coursereport

248,le wagon,2022-07-01,"I attended Le Wagon's remote's Web Development Course - Full-time from April 2022 to June 2002. What I got was beyond my expectatives. I've already heard of the ""normal"" path (IRL) but the remote was really intensive & high quality. From 9 to 6pm, we have little theory in the morning, then directly on coding challenges. Of course, it seems difficult, but: 1/ we have the main teacher + bunch of teacher's assistants always here to help us. 2/ we worked in team of 4, which is really great and that changes every days, so we can really ""meet"" all the students 3/ it is really practical to manage with the fact that we can study from wherever we want, as it is remote. 4/ the back office / student's platform is amazingly well built to follow our daily progress. What I liked the most, was that despite the online, we really built strong links with the other students. When ending Le Wagon, we have a great tools box, and can start whatever job as junior. They teach us how to think, organise, solve coding problems & give us the keys to - after le Wagon - dig into new other learnings. This is the most important. Of course, we don't know everything (far from it), but we can independently after le Wagon, learn by ourselves. There is also a career week at the end, which is very very helpful to make the transition from the Camp to the ""back to reality"". I recommend Le Wagon, for everyone who: wants to become a dev, wants to build a firm project/start up where general high knowledge is requested, becomes head of product, wants to change one's life (new career), even maybe becoming a coding teacher (starting as teacher assistant). As a mother of 2 young kids, it was quite challenging, but possible. Go for it!",coursereport

If you have questions at whatever point of the day, there are always very motivated teachers around you ready to jump in and help you find the solution/answers yourself with their guidence.

But actually they are not! Having an extensive background in the Hotel Industry, I found myself working as an assistant to the one of the two founders of a software startup in Berlin. This is where I first got a taste of what software development is all about. I was hooked! Through friends I found out about Le Wagon, the curriculum and teaching style. When the moment was right, I decided to take the step towards learning a new profession and completely changing my life! I was lucky enough to have the full support of my company, which means that after the bootcamp I could return there and work as a Software Developer! The 9 weeks I spent on the campus was filled with a rollercoaster of emotions and a learning curve I had yet to experience. Never in my life have I learned so much in such a little time. Even though it was very demanding and intensive, it really was exhilarating! Each morning you learn a new concept and then you get to work on it during the day together with a fellow classmate. If you are stuck you can ask one of the Teaching Assistants, who are there to help you solve your issue or just pick their brains about different approaches to a problem! What you also get to do during the bootcamp is meet extraordinary people! Everyone has a different background and experiences from which you can deeply benefit. Together with that you get the chance to meet several representatives from across the industry and find out more about their experiences and how they started their career. What a ride it has been so far! I would highly recommend this bootcamp and I would do it all over again in a heartbeat!",coursereport

While I was self-learning, researching, going to workshops, etc. I started investigating different Bootcamps because nothing beats learning with a group of people at around the same level at the same trying to reach the same goal. Le Wagon was always very active and welcoming and that made it easy to choose them, especially as they have so many financing options to help out as well. I was not disappointed! Though the learning curve is steep, especially as I had NO past hands-on experience (except the scattered workshops and self-learning, which is very different), all of the teachers, TA's and staff are constantly focused on the students, helping every single person and checking up on you. Even when I felt very far behind with concepts, you never felt left alone. You have a buddy system where you're paired up with someone different every day, you go through exercises in groups or pairs and the teachers are kind and funny. I spent the whole Bootcamp laughing every day, as well! It's hard but it's also FUN! Not only did it finally(!) click after sticking with it but it encourages bonding and teamwork and teaches you to work in groups with people of different levels and backgrounds. I finished the Bootcamp feeling proud of what I learnt in a small amount of time and confident enough to continue learning and to finally apply to jobs myself. They teach you all you need to know to kick-start your journey (or cement your previous knowledge) but you also become part of a wonderful, fun and encouraging community!

I went through LeWagon's curriculum and found it was the most relevant out there. The course gets intensive right from Day 1. You get to learn lots of fundamental concepts in a very short time. Their way of teaching structure is the key - you get to learn from your TAs, teachers as well as your buddies. The real fun started half way when we were asked to pitch an idea for the final project to be built in last 2 weeks of the course. The final project weeks were the most hectic times, but they were amazing in terms of learning. While building the product we could put everything that we learned into practice, and be creative. Even after you leave LeWagon you will still be a part of the bigger LeWagon family which has its own benefits. I feel I am better equipped in the developer job market as LeWagon gave me a fair shot at web development jobs. It is surely a long term investment. I cherish to be a part of the LeWagon community, who are always ready to help you out when you're stuck or need some guidance. I highly recommend LeWagon if you wish to learn coding.",coursereport

The course covers all the fundamentals you need in order to start a career in web development and by the end you will be able to build a fully functional website. The thing that makes Le Wagon so special is the community atmosphere. You work with buddies every day so that you learn from fellow students, and there are always TAs and teachers available to answer questions. The teachers genuinely care about your personal development and make sure that you stay on track throughout the bootcamp. On top of this, there are community events organized so that you also have fun too. I have no regrets about choosing Le Wagon as the place to learn to code.",coursereport
269,le wagon,2020-05-04,"When I joined Lewagon, I was at a point in my carrer where I was looking for a major change. I had been working as a freelance music composer and a sound designer for over 10 years, and as much as I loved this field, I was looking for more financial stability, which is hard to find in the music Industry. I got interested in coding a bit by accident. I always new I liked maths and solving problems, so when I approached coding I got hooked right away. Nevertheless, I was overwhelmed with the number of languages available or the numerous concepts I had to grasp as a web developer, and I didn't really know where to start. I needed some guidance. I looked up for schools and bootcamps, and Lewagon quickly stood out as the obvious choice! And after 2 crazy months of intensive learning, I was not disappointed! I have learned so much! Coding languages such as Ruby or Javascript, Frontend languages like HTML or CSS. Handling databases with SQL or Active Records. I have learned using Frameworks like Rails and plenty more concepts like APIs, DOM events, online payment systems, UI and UX designs and so much more. But that was not all. Lewagon also teaches you to work in teams, manage projects, plan projects, set deadlines and even more unexpectedly, to present your project in front of a crowd (for those who wish to)! I did all that, and I had to surpass myself, but it was so worth it. The atmosphere they manage to create, as much among students as with the teachers, is simply amazing. A buddy system that resets every day makes you work with team mates of different levels. Your buddies can either help you when you are in difficulty, or you can test your knowledge by explaining the concepts you have learned to those lagging behind. This a great way not only to improve your skills, but to bond with other students. And every Friday, there is a get together organized, where you get to relax around a drink and hang out, and sometimes there is even a karaoke, or a movie night organized. After 2 months of immersive and intensive code learning in this amazing community, I miss the atmosphere, the daily challenges, and the people, both students and teachers. But something wonderful, is that you get to be part of the Lewagon community forever :)",coursereport

I just did't know where to start. LeWagon was kind of enlightening for me, every day my brain was broken down into its individual parts and then reassembled. Yes, it was overwhelming and hard, yes, I definitely reached my limits. But that was, what I was looking for. It's a bootcamp! The 9-week fulltime-course ist really compressed, because there is a lot to know, and to be honest, you have to know that this is only the beginning. Everyone who says, you know everything you need to know after taking part in a coding-bootcamp, is a liar. But it's really, really good structured, lectures are available online to recap, you have daily changing buddy everyday (one of the other students), which helps to learn by explaining to others, you can always ask your more or less stupid questions to the teachers and TAs. And just everyone of the stuff and also students in my batch was so nice and helpful. And after that 9 weeks, you have coded your first web app! Not to forget, beside the emotional rollercoster that you have to deal with, it's a lot of fun! So if you're thinking about taking part in the next batch, just do it (and don't forget your daily flashcards!)",coursereport
271,le wagon,2020-05-02,"I was working as Online Marketing Manager specialized on Paid Social Media and Lead Gen. It was my first real job after my graduation and at the beginning I was quite challenged and had a great team. I was kind of an all-rounder regarding creative and technical tasks as well as analytics and business strategies and I was able to step up the career ladder. Working was fun. But after 2,5 years I realized it's not challenging anymore and the career steps I could take in that field are limited. I was never fancied by business administration and that part was taking too much of my responsibilities. I've decided to push my technical and creative skills to the next level and do the coding bootcamp at Le Wagon in Berlin. Looking back I couldn't be more happy about this decision! Going back to study was tough but also I welcomed the challenge a lot after being bored in my job. Le Wagon was the perfect choice for me. I had no clue about coding. The curriculum sounded like Chinese to me, but I trusted my developer friends who told me it's a very good mixture for getting started and it's covering all the basics you need at the beginning. If you are searching for a bootcamp with wonderful, fun and amazingly patient teachers and teaching assistance, great professional in-person lectures, a fantastic learning platform, an huge and valuable alumni network, and an extreme but wonderful 3-month experience I strongly recommend the Le Wagon bootcamp in Berlin!

272,le wagon,2020-05-01,"If I look back at 2019 and review the decisions I took, I could definitely rank the one, that brought me to Le Wagon, as one of the best I have ever made. There are so many online resources, which can help you develop your coding skills but no matter how good the course is, there is always something missing - guidance, proper structure or simply someone, you can rely on, when facing all the difficulties along your coding journey, someone, who can give you the missing drive, when things are not going the way you imagined at first place. The guys from Le Wagon managed to ace all those aspects, which made the whole experience unforgettable. The program is intense and actually this is how it is supposed to be, in order to get the best of the bootcamp and strive for a successful career in the tech industry. The journey was quite challenging for me but it was worth every minute - especially seeing the final product developed by our project team on the Demo Day. Now couple of months later, remembering the time spent there, I am glad making this step as it brought me new skills and introduced me to great people - all part of a supportive Alumni community, where you can share your questions and ideas (not only during but also after the bootcamp is over).",coursereport

I started the bootcamp because I was always interested in coding & also wanted to be independent from our IT department. So I quit my job. To be honest I was really scared if this was the right decision and I always imagined myself struggling so hard that I need to go back to my old job. But in the end it was the best decision & I had an amazing time at Le Wagon Berlin. I learned so much in these 9 intensive weeks and got so much help from all the teachers and staff from Le Wagon. Next to that it was also a great experience because of all the people I got to know. It really felt like a second home in the end and actually I was super sad to leave this place after these great weeks. But the good thing about Le Wagon is, that you are still in this big community. So after the bootcamp you get a lot of help and information from more than 7.000 graduates from all over the world. So all I can say is thank you to Le Wagon and all the teachers for this great time!

274,le wagon,2020-04-30,"Since I was a child, I have had great interest in computers and everything they entail, from superficial aspects all the way to the small details that make up the the inner workings of a computer. I started a CES (Computational Engineering Science) course to dive deeper into it, and suddenly found myself falling in love with programming! At that point, I was absolutely certain that I wanted to become a developer and program for a living. The problem, however, was that at the same time I started to notice that the course I had chosen wasn't really taking me to where I wanted to be. This is where Le Wagon came in! While searching for a way to improve my coding skills and really focus on becoming a developer, I came across Le Wagon. I admit that I was afraid at first, because it all sounded very daunting and I wasn't really sure if was going to be able to keep up. After a pep-talk from my family and a couple of deep breaths, I signed up and went in head-first...and I loved every second of it. Don't get me wrong, it was not easy — the syllabus is tough and there is a lot of information —, but boy was it fun. I learned a lot of new things — programming languages (yes, plural) that were entirely new to me, software development patterns, databases, a many other things in between. I also learned that ""teamwork makes the dream work"", which became clear very quickly because of the amazing community that is Le Wagon, from staff to students. The buddy system — a system that automatically creates pairs of students that will work together, daily — is a great way to make sure that you always have someone you can discuss solutions with, which is very important when coding your way through all the daily challenges. There's always an example of a real life application for what you're learning so that you can easily see what you can achieve as you go. In the end, it all comes together in one giant toolbox of skills that you will use to create an entire project, in a team, from scratch! On the staff side, everything is planned, built and executed very well. Everyone is quick on their feet and always ready to help you out if get stuck — without giving away the answers, but rather helping you use the tools you have to figure it out for yourself. Everyone is full of energy and the atmosphere is just amazing! Even after the bootcamp you will always have their support if you need it, as well as from the entire Le Wagon community (as in worldwide) for anything from searching for a job to solving coding issues with your personal projects. I hope that I was able to convey just how amazing Le Wagon is, even thought I barely scratched the surface. If you're afraid, don't be. There is always someone there to help you learn, and the community is tight-knight and growing with every new batch of students worldwide. You'll feel right at home! It's a great opportunity to learn a lot of new things and make friends, and I can promise you that you will not regret it. It's tough, but you can do it!",coursereport
275,le wagon,2020-04-30,"I always was fascinated by technology since I was a little kid so it was kind of natural to study electrical engineering. During my studies I've worked in several corporate companies and always had the feeling not to see the impact of my work. I wanted to get closer to the user and build something for people I can relate to. With ""Apps"" I found something, that really sparked my interest and I was curious about how to build them. I was now in my master's when I started to learn web development on my own with online resources. Since the web as we know it today has gone through a long evolution, I felt kind of overwhelmed by all the anagrams. I didn't really know where to start. While I was doing research I came across the topic ""Coding Bootcamp"". It didn't take long to make a decision then. I dropped out of university, took a full-time job in a restaurant to get the course fees together and finally moved to Berlin. The 9 weeks at Le Wagon were very demanding and impressive at the same time. Nothing was missing and I learned all the tools I need to implement my own ideas. I met amazing people and today I am proud to be part of a community of people who share the same passion for digitalization.",coursereport
276,le wagon,2020-04-28,"The slogan of Le Wagon describes exactly my experience at the bootcamp! A little bit about me for the background: I have been working as a Biz Dev Manager in the Ad Tech Industry. I learnt a lot during that time. But I felt it wasn't the thing I wanted to do for the next 10 years. A friend of mine was a professional musician and changed his career path into coding through a bootcamp. It made me understand that you don't need a technical background or having studied computer science to become a developer. I tried coding and loved it. I like to work on one hand analytical and on the other hand creative. I could find it in coding. Moreover I love to meditate, and coding is truly meditative. Or a good training for letting go when you feel frustrated! So I watched for a coding bootcamp in Berlin and wanted to do Le Wagon for several reasons: - the curriculum is very transparent and well-structured. You know exactly what to expect from the program. - you have access to the learning platform after the bootcamp for an unlimited time. - Le Wagon puts a big effort in its alumni community. During the bootcamp, I will not lie : it's intense! You learn a lot. But as you have access to the platform, including videos from the lectures, you can catch up later or after the bootcamp. The learning platform is amazing, the program is very transparent and fills the expectations of the curriculum. You can see with this program that Le Wagon is a well structured organisation wanting to give the best quality for its students. The teaching staff was very supportive and accessible. During the bootcamp, we had enough teachers and teacher assistants to answer the questions during the day. So I didn’t wait when I needed help. There as well, I could feel that Le Wagon puts a lot of effort so that the students have a good experience and a good time. Every friday (and more if you want), there is drinks organised where staff and students come together. As well people who didn’t want to take actively part of the community events weren’t push to do so. Everyone is welcome, the way he/she wants. Regarding the alumni community, Le Wagon went beyond my expectations. You have access to a big and active network who shares experiences and knowledges after the bootcamp. After the bootcamp, I looked three months for a job and got hired as a Junior Front End Developer. So this is why I can tell that Le Wagon was a life-changing experience :)",coursereport
277,le wagon,2020-04-28,"After studying Communications, I never really found what I wanted to do. I've been working in the startup scene, and noticed that operations was something that I liked a lot: hands-on and automating processes. However, I never fully understood what was happening in the backend of our programs. Le Wagon organises lots of events, one of them I attended and I learned to setup a landing page within a day with some basic HTML and CSS. This made me super happy and gave me the insight that I could definitely could learn how to code. The group of teachers and TAs that day convinced me that I shouldn't doubt about myself and my skills. Not gonna lie: the bootcamp is intense. You'll earn so much on a day, that sometimes it was hard to keep up. But once I understood that it isn't a competition - you're there purely for yourself - the experience was so great. I'm proud of the hard skills I've gained, I'm proud of the contacts I've made, and I'm proud of our final project that turned into an actual company. The whole experience is a melting pot of great people (so many different backgrounds and nationalities), great teachers and TAs (they all have done the bootcamp themselves), a super up to date curriculum, and a learning tool that is designed by themselves so it's adjusted when needed. I would fully recommend this bootcamp to everyone.",coursereport
278,le wagon,2019-09-05,"This review has been a long time coming, but it's well deserved. I had been teaching English as a foreign language in Poland for the better part of the last eight years. I had always been interested in coding and IT in general, and over the years I had managed to learn some JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Python. However, with the responsibilities of a family and working long hours, up until a year ago I didn't have much time or energy to focus and learning how to code. Last year, things had changed a bit for me, and I was given the opportunity to stop working and focus on self study. I wanted to transition to IT work, as that was the type of work I was doing doing before I had moved to Poland nine years ago. At first I thought working on my strengths, I'd already had a lot of experience with Linux and was interested in working for local telecom companies, most of which required some experience with ITIL (Product lifecycle management methodology) and spent the first 6 months of last year, training and working towards both a Linux and ITIL certification. I learned a great deal about both, but wasn't really passionate about either. I then decided that what I really wanted to do was code. and so for then following four months, I decided to self study Python programming. I completed ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" and found that I was much more interested in coding and decided that while I was learning a great deal more about something that I had felt more passionate about, that my window of opportunity was closing soon. My wife and I discussed about finding a coding school that I could attend. I applied and was accepted to Le Wagon. Le Wagon was a really great experience for me. It was difficult being away from my wife and children so long, and I spent most of those two nine weeks studying and coding, but I had learned more about coding in those nine weeks than I had in all those years before. I would have to say that the best asspects of Le Wagon's Program is the structured curriculm, the tools that are made available to you, and the Teachers and Teacher assistant whom were highly skilled and always helpful. My only regret is that I hadn't decided on going much earlier.",coursereport
279,le wagon,2019-07-16,"So at the end of my classical business administration degree I felt lost. I majored in finance and accounting and after I did an internship in auditing I knew that this was not for me. When my college program came to an end, I fortunately had the opportunity to do an internship in product management. However, just collaborating with developers was not enough for me, even though that was a very enjoyable experience - I wanted to learn to build stuff myself! I talked to a lot of people and the overall message I got was: ""If you really want to learn as much as possible and be employable after just a couple of months, you should consider a coding bootcamp"". So I started looking into coding bootcamps and as it turned out, Le Wagon was the best rated coding bootcamp I could find. In the beginning, I was pretty skeptical since I usually dont trust products, that almost have no bad reviews. I started looking deeper into it (curriculum, demo days, former students on linkedin) and as it turned out, a lot of people were really able to transition into tech afterwards even though they had no traditional tech background! So I applied, had the interview, and got accepted. The following 9 weeks were nothing but amazing. Each day, we had an interactive lecture followed by coding challenges which deepened the knowledge and also helped in getting to know the other students. Thanks to the buddy system, you always have the opportunity to ask questions to another student or explain concepts if you feel like you really understood it. There are also a lot of incredibly competent Teaching Assistants who make sure that you won't be stuck for too long. Each day subsequently ended with an interactive livecode session in which one student would go upfront and showcase his solution to some new coding problem. Furthermore, Le Wagon did a very good job in making sure that all the students get to know each other by hosting a lot of very cool and interesting events. The most fulfilling experience were the last 3 weeks in which we built 2 products in a 3-4 member team. Going through the first incredibly draining and ultimately joyful 6 weeks finally came together in building something by ourselves which we would ultimately showcase in front of all the people on demoday (definetly check out some former events on youtube or go visit one yourself!) If you really want to acquire the necessary skills to build something yourself and be employable as a junior dev, I'd 100% recommend doing LeWagon.

I never learned so much in a day, let stand in nine weeks! Because of the pair programming you learn how to explain your code to people and you learn to ask for help if you do not know how to solve the problem. During the bootcamp you learn all the basics and also learn how to write clean and good code. This is something I haven’t learned during my studies and is something companies really like to see. I can recommend this course to anybody who wants to start a career as a developer or wants to know what is takes to become a developer.

I have always been interested in coding and have tried to teach myself before, unfortunately unsuccessfully. Also for my current job it is an advantage, because many processes are automated further and further by programs and I have developed a certain understanding for it. Because of the reviews and the nice conversation with Rich, the driver, I chose Le Wagon. Le Wagon seemed to have good teaching staff, a central location and a damn good concept. The mix in the group should always be very international. Everything proved to be true and was even surpassed. I would especially like to emphasize the learning platform of Le Wagon. I have attended a lot of courses in my military career and during my studies. But I have never experienced an effectiveness like this learning platform before. From simple to difficult, test programs to check or improve your code, additional tasks for faster understanding students, buddy or group work to encourage collaboration. And as icing on the cake, qualified and friendly teachers who make sure that you don't get lost. Conclusion: I can fully recommend Le Wagon. I learned a lot, had a great time in Berlin with great people and will always remember it positively. I will stick to coding, even if only in my spare time and out of interest.

282,le wagon,2019-07-10,"Sometimes educational experiences do not live up to their expectations. The 9 week fullstack programme at Le Wagon felt like the complete opposite for me, it was an amazing experience that far surpassed any expectations I had set for it. After having studied Business Entrepreneurship for a year and a half, I continuously kept hitting the same barrier: not being able to build & properly understand digital products. With the global trend of digital transition for all businesses, knowing how to code isn't just a valuable skill anymore, it's a mandatory skill. My biggest question was - where do I actually start? I had tried Udemy, Codeacademy, and countless youtube tutorials to get an understanding of basic HTML/CSS/JS, but I could never take it any further than being able to code basic landing pages. The bootcamp at Le Wagon was the perfect programme to take a deeper (but crucially: guided) dive, and to properly learn the basics of programming in 9 weeks. If you have a desire to learn how to code, but don't quite have the independence to do it all yourself, Le Wagon is a perfect environment help you start your journey. The pace of the course is fast, but the steep learning curve is brilliantly supported. The combination of very high quality lectures from industry professionals, to multiple exciting and challenging coding challenges everyday ensures that my experience of the 9 weeks was nothing short of life changing! The lecturers, TA's and all the other staff were wonderful to work with, and everyone is commited to making sure you learn as efficiently as your brain can manage. Though you won't be an expert developer at the end of a 9 week bootcamp, Le Wagon teaches you crucial knowledge and techniques to kick of your journey as a developer. By teaching us Ruby on Rails, CSS, HTML, ES6, Ruby, MVC, OOP, DB structures & sql (postgreSQL), I feel like I have a solid foundation on which to continue learning. Crucially, I now have all the right tools (and mindset) to learn new languages/frameworks which pique my interest. The last project weeks allow you to build and deploy a real webapp, and discover what it's like to collaborate in a development team (using Github & proper tools to assign work/tasks/user stories). This is a perfect taster & preparation for starting a career as a junior developer, or stepping into product management (with a strong foundation in technical knowledge). All in all, a 9 week bootcamp has given me knowledge, tools, understanding and a very strong foundation from which to continue learning. Perhaps even more importantly, it's given me access to the incredible Le Wagon network. A worldwide community of everything from developers to product managers to artists willing to collaborate, foster new connections, introduce you to companies, teach you, etc. If I had to take the decision again, I would choose for Le Wagon every time.",coursereport

When I found Le Wagon, not only were they prices very low (compared to programs in the States) their curriculum was very streamlined. After attending the program I can safely say they did not disappoint. The program is structured so that you can get as much or as little help as you want. If you feel really solid on a subject you can push ahead work through extra challenges or projects. If you're struggling a bit, there are teaching assistants, classmates, alumni, slack channels, and teachers to help you. Apart from it being a great learning environment the material is focused on teaching you everything you need to know to be a full-stack dev and then giving you the resources to continue to learn. The teachers at Le Wagon are attentive and really understand how to help you through the program since most of them attended the course at some point. Lastly, the community that you gain after the program is invaluable. To this day if I am stuck on a particular problem or error, I can just reach out to one of the 5000+ alumni scattered around the world and I'll be able to get help.

As it turns out, I was definitely wrong about that last part. I learned *way* more during my two months at Le Wagon than I had during the preceding fourth months of self-directed learning. The course has a great structure, a heap of helpful resources and, most important of all, a super-enthusiastic group of teachers who really care about your development.

I visited the batch in autumn 2018 with about 40 others. At the beginning I thought that there were too many people, but the lessons were always very smooth. With the ""buddy system"" you work with a different classmate every day anyway. In general, everything is very well structured. The day starts with a lecture, then you work with the buddy on various tasks. You basically work independently, but if you can't get any further, you can fall back on the buddy. This system has a very exciting dynamic, because sometimes I understood a concept better and thus helped the buddy and sometimes vice versa. By explaining it, you learn a lot yourself. In the evening follows a live coding session in class. The learning platform is very well structured with all the tasks (built-in solutions), videos and slides of the lectures, flashcards, etc. (Of course you still have access after the course). Some teachers are Le Wagon Alumnis, but all are competent and more than capable. For more complicated topics (e.g. SQL) there are also external experts who teach.

Having studied completely different subjects for the past 7 years, I thought that coding would be a very difficult challenge. Alas, the teachers in Berlin proved me otherwise. Le Wagon's methods are simple, to the point and quite clear about where they are heading towards during the 9-week program. You learn all the basics to become a good web developer through a completely hands-on approach. You write your code, you test it, you break it, and you have those 10 seconds of bliss when it finally works. Then you move on to the next exercise and to the same process all over again. All of this punctuated with interesting talks and insights that the staff organize in a weekly basis. It is incredibly interesting and really helps you if you’re not familiar with the whole tech scene. The staff is incredibly friendly and always willing to teach you and help you with whatever you need. From the driver to the teachers, everyone is very accessible and friendly. This really made Le Wagon stand out for me, I felt like I didn't want to leave the bootcamp at the end of each day. Make no mistake, doing a bootcamp is a handful of work, but Le Wagon manages to create a excellent work environment for everyone, which made the whole learning experience a lot more enjoyable than I thought. All of this culminates in the last 3 weeks when you work with a closed team of 3 to 4 people on your final project. It is a true taste of working in a team project, filled with the highs and lows you might expect. The teachers are even more involved than before, helping each team to design their apps. People will get stressed, your team will break new ground when it comes to coding skills and you'll learn a lot of new, specific things during the last part of the bootcamp, all of this according to what you plan on doing. Then, on the final day, you and your team demonstrate what you built to everyone, and you marvel not necessarily at the app you created, but at how everything came together in the end (sometimes against all odds) and you managed to finish everything you set out to do. Le Wagon? 10/10, I'd do it all over again in a heartbeat. I have learned valuable coding and teamwork skills that will certainly help me a lot in the years to come as I dive into a whole different field of work.",coursereport
288,le wagon,2019-01-07,"I decided to do Le Wagon after some online research about bootcamps in Berlin and I strongly recommend it. I had a previous experience with learning to code (I completed a Virtual Reality nanodegree at Udacity), but I found the approach at Le Wagon way better. The teachers are well prepared and in just a couple of weeks I went from zero knowledge of Backend to building apps with good-looking Frontend. Everyday we had new challenges to solve with a pair and even optionals if you finish the basic ones. Somedays I got to the end of all of them and in others I would be stuck and almost not even accomplish the first few. But it is a great way to recognize your strong and weak points. In my case, before the bootcamp I though I would be focusing more on Frontend development, just to realize that my strongest skills are actually the ones related to the Backend work. Another advantage of the bootcamp at Le Wagon is the final project. We got to work together in groups and developed web applications with Ruby on Rails, also learning how to use Github properly. Working in group is rather different than alone, and I believe this is also an important skill to have when we want to join a company or even start one. After all, Le Wagon was even better than I expected and I recommend it!",coursereport
289,le wagon,2018-10-17,"I am a business graduate and worked as a finance professional before entering Le Wagon. Tech-related work always interested me and I tried to pick up bits and pieces about coding, but never really had the perseverance and wholistic knowledge resources to really get started in tech. Building a website requires knowledge about so many programming languages, frameworks, and concepts that I was never really able to bring all the pieces together. A friend of me told me about Le Wagon and the learning style seemed to be perfect for me. Le Wagon has an intranet with resources that help during and after the bootcamp. The bootcamp is built around this intranet and I learned how to solve technical issues with and without help from instructors. After the bootcamp, I was able to build complete websites with all sorts of functionality, design features, and user interactivity. As I started a data science degree program after the bootcamp, I benefited from the software development skills that the bootcamp provides to students. Now, I am not only confident in web development, but I can also transfer these skills to other software development-related fields. Our ""batch"" (that is the bunch of people that did the bootcamp with me at the same time in Berlin) was international to more than 50% and we spoke English 99% of the time. Everyone had a different background and almost everyone had a big career change coming up. After the bootcamp, I stayed in touch with many fellow students and we help each other looking for jobs and finding tech talent. I can recommend this bootcamp to anyone who wants to learn web development in a very short time.",coursereport
290,le wagon,2018-09-24,"Le Wagon was a truly challenging but wholly rewarding experience. Over the course of two months I was taken from an absolute novice, to a capable and cognisant junior developer. By the end of the course I was not only able to code in multiple Frontend and Backend languages but I was able to identify areas of interest and languages that I wanted to investigate. The bootcamp has provided a solid and well-formed foundation upon which I can build my own career. Coming from an Education and Fine Art professional background, my knowledge of computers was limited. The Teachers and TAs of Le Wagon Berlin worked hard to ensure that all students got the help they needed, able to differentiate those with a history in coding, and those fresh to the craft. Daily Extension Tasks pushed those with more experience, while clear instructions, comprehensive lectures and online resources, built-in testing, and an efficient and effective ticketing system meant that anyone who needed help could readily find it. However the teaching was not limited to the Teachers and TAs, I found that I learnt the most from my buddy. The buddy system pairs you with a different classmate each day, allowing you to share your strengths, and learn from each other, all the while becoming great mates with the people in your bootcamp. The bootcamp also runs on a rotating system of Teachers and TAs meaning that there were always new, fresh experts to learn from. We were taught by Industry Professionals from around the world. The TAs, all of whom are recent graduates, we capable at assisting us but I found them most valuable in empathising with our struggles. Having recently been through the bootcamp, the TAs were excellent at assuaging our stresses and getting us over whatever hurdles we were facing. Morning Lectures and Afternoon Livecodes, meant that you were always pushed to learn and try new techniques. And it was this intensity that enabled so much learning to take place in such a short span of time. Over the course of the two months I built several functioning applications, some of which are live and online today. Being able to code a fully functioning web application from nothing seemed so foreign before Le Wagon, now it is not only a reality, but a pleasure. These skills cater to all types of people. From the truly creative, to the lovers of problem-solving, my classmates were wide ranging, highly analytical and highly artistic. Coding allows you to engage all parts of your brain, and Le Wagon helped us to understand code. This course will teach you how to code. But it also teaches you how to develop a User Journey, how to Pitch a Product, how to Work as a Team. Le Wagon is a holistic learning experience that I would recommend to anyone interested in gaining more knowledge about the coding and tech world.",coursereport
291,le wagon,2018-09-23,"Everyone asks me - was it worth it? Did you enjoy it? Not too difficult or too boring? My answer is always - it was simply one of the best decisions I've made in my life. After spending several years as a category manager in a big international corporation I realised it's high time for a change. I felt a strong need to learn something new and get into a new environment, gain independence and the ability to create something useful from scratch. I considered several possibilities and realised that programming might be worth trying. Le Wagon bootcamp seemed like the perfect solution as they said you don't need any previous coding experience, guaranteed a comprehensive program that would give me a strong basis for a new career as a programmer and simply looked like a cool and passionate group of people. How were the 9 weeks? Crazy! Le Wagon delivered what they promised - the bootcamp gave us a great introduction to the coding universe, going step by step from the foundation through advanced concepts. And I won't lie - it was an incredibly demanding time. However thanks to our own motivation and full support from an amazing team of teachers we managed to become fluent in Ruby on Rails, manage databases, create beautiful front end and the thing of utmost importance - create our own products! Last three weeks of the bootcamp taught us how to work in teams while working on our applications which is super important before making your first steps as a Junior Developer. We learned how to compromise, split tasks, work on GitHub and last but not least - communicate! Le Wagon gives you the skills. But the invaluable advantage is also the worldwide community that you join - amazing, helpful people with experience they are happy to share. Yes. One of the best decisions in my life :)",coursereport

You may come in barely knowing what a function is, leaving with ability to create performant websites. They make sure that all the participants are able to understand and code and everyone gets special care, be it problem with a coding task or a question about a startup idea. Do not worry if you have never coded in your life. Also, do not worry if you have some coding skills, the bootcamp is a valuable experience that will teach you front-end (JS, HTML, CSS), back-end (SQL, Rails & Ruby) and everything in between (tools, git, colaboration, design process, testing etc)! They prepare you to kick start your coding career. It is worth it.",coursereport
293,le wagon,2018-07-10,"I used to be a graphic designer with strong knowledge of print media and marketing. I had made website designs and prototypes before and had worked on the visual side of web applications. I knew some HTML and CSS, but I had never any experience with the servers and backend part of the projects. Never had I opened Terminal before. At the age of 39, I felt that I had to make a change. Learning how to code is to our generation the same as was learning how to read and write to people two hundred years ago - the illiterate ones will never catch up with the faster ones in their career. So I looked for the best coding bootcamp in Europe and came across Le Wagon. The reviews were so good that I decided to apply. After graduating from batch no #124, I can assure you all that the positive 5-star reviews do not lie. It really is just as good as it reads! The curriculum is excellent and its web-based online learning environment is super-useful. There is so much to explore and it's being updated on a daily basis. I still use it regularly to find answers to my coding-related questions today. The teachers are very professional, confident, natural talents - all of them. My favourite was Alice. She just kept the whole thing together and was such an inspiration. On our final project week she spent hours trying to restore my petty Javascript animation. Not because that it was such an important feature, but because I as a student had worked so hard on it and she thought it was important. In addition to teachers, there are a number of assistants. You will get as much help as you ask - they are there for you all the time. They sit long hours with you solving a problem and later relax together with you and have a beer. Very, very positive vibe indeed. What I liked the most, was the product-centered, entrepreneurial mindset an bias of the curriculum - we had product pitch sessions and brainstorms and everyone, who wanted, had a chance to shine. Surely the best thing about Le Wagon, is the large, worldwide community of like-minded entrepreneurial, helpful cool people that you will have a connection with after graduating. Everyone is always invited back for demo days and cocktail nights to have a good time together. Five stars out of five. Period.",coursereport
294,le wagon,2018-06-01,"I got first introduced with Le Wagon in Brussels in late 2015. A year later I tried to learn myself how to code. I completed some online courses on HTML, CSS and Python without really doing any projects. I made little progress and my learning curve was very flat. As I only stayed on the surface of things I didn't really see the point of me contuining to learn how to code. Boy was I wrong! It was not until the summer of 2017 that I decided to emerge myself fully into coding. To do this I knew I needed to enroll in a bootcamp. Now, how do you choose your bootcamp? A couple of things were important to me. This bootcamp: would be present in Europe and preferably in the most beautiful European Capitals. would cost less than €10.000. would include an international network of alumni. would teach me more than one programming language and let me work on at least one project in depth. Le Wagon met all of the above criteria. I ultimately choose for Berlin because of it's startup vibe, cultural history and level of professionalism of the resident Le Wagon team. So far Le Wagon bootcamp has been the most immersive coding workout I ever encountered. Le Wagon offers a tightly-knit 9-week coding schedule backed by extremely talented Teaching Assistants, a handy online 'knowledge' platform with exercises and an innovative startup vibe. In only 9 weeks I learned how to master HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript ES2015, SQL, git, GitHub, Heroku and Ruby on Rails. In the last two weeks teams were formed to develop on our own Rails applications. Together with my team I brainstormed, designed and developed a full-fledged task management platform for Handy Men called Handy Harry. On the last day of the bootcamp you get a taste of the real startup world when you get to showcase your application on stage in front of Berlin's tech scene, friends and family. Best learning experience so far! Thank you",coursereport
295,le wagon,2018-06-01,"My interest about coding started when I was on marketing position that required creating a lot of automated campaigns set up API connections between all the services I was using. However, not having the technical knowledge to do that, each task was always a struggle to be accomplished, especially when I needed to rely on other developers to dedicate the time on their busy schedule to help me out. I started by taking some online courses to see if it was something I could envision myself doing, and it soon made me realize that: yes, I liked and enjoyed coding; and I'd need a more structured course and environment. Then, I started my quest to find the best coding bootcamp, the one that would put me on a fast track to reach my goal of learning code and be able to actually work with it. On my search, I came across a handful of courses. I started looking to the curriculum and the overall aspects of the program, such as the network, in-class assistance and job assistance after the bootcamp. Le Wagon really beat up any other I found. The curriculum and technologies learned where relevant and up-to-date (vouched by friend developers) and the reviews and feedback I received from alumni I reached out to were 10s across the board. The one thing I was a bit hesitant still was the job search after the bootcamp, as some other schools had big and temptatious promises to get you a job right after completion, but looking at all the other aspects they were not as strong. At this point, I had to make a decision: take on the challenge and go with the strongest bootcamp or stay in the status quo and hope for a promise to come through. So I decided to go with Le Wagon and really invest myself in it to get the best out of this experience. From day one we started coding and work on challenges, and every day after that seemed like were twice as much as the previous day. The learning curve is crazy steep and fast. The amazing teaching team is a great reason of why the whole batch could achieve it, they were always supportive and didn't hesitate to sit with you for all the time needed to solve any question or make the knowledge acquired even more solid. Fast forward to the final weeks of the bootcamp, the projects weeks are the most awesome time you will have during the whole course. That's when you realize the how strong is the power of building things from scratch and working with amazing fellows developers on it - and before starting Le Wagon we'd wouldn't be able to do any of that. This is the greatest time to put all the things learned during the bootcamp in practice, and solve bugs of course. :) Now back to my main goal, switch career paths and find a tech job after the bootcamp. In retrospective, I made the best choice when I decided to go with the course that offered me the strongest curriculum, network and overall experience. I was able to get interview and land on a job that I really wanted within less than a month searching. I owe that mostly to the strong development basis I built during the whole experience at Le Wagon, even the final projects served as a great portfolio to recruiters when I was asked about things I had built previously. Overall my experiece at Le Wagon was amazing, I'd do it again and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone interested in becoming a developer or just get more into the tech side of any industry.",coursereport
296,le wagon,2018-05-31,"Having suffered in math all throughout school and coming from a strictly liberal arts background, I was afraid programming would be too hard for my analytical brain to truly grasp in 9 weeks. Yet, the interest in the subject was big enough that I decided to pursue Le Wagon anyways. My experience during those 9 weeks shocked me. The long hours quickly translated into the steepest learning curve of my life to date. And although I didn't go in with the intention of becoming a developer afterwards, the passion transmitted by the teachers everyday, the holistic curriculum, and the supportive LW community have left in me curiosity about the programming world that I cannot shake off. I would recommend Le Wagon to anyone, from any background, with any interest or previous any skill-set. Understanding how the internet and the tech world works is an asset that cannot be dismissed in the 21st century and layering code on top of people's knowledge is one of the most powerful tools we have to positively impact the world. So if that's what you want to do, then I'd say jump on the Wagon!",coursereport
297,le wagon,2018-05-31,"I never really had the courage to actually get behind a computer and start learning to code all by myself. I thought that would be super complicated and I wouldn't be able to comprehend anything. I started to search for schools that teach me all of this in the best way possible. The best approach for me to learn something is ""learning by doing"", so I searched for something doing just that. A boot camp would've been ideal and so my journey started. I decided to take part in the 9-week coding Bootcamp of Le Wagon. I must say, at this point, it was the best decision I could've made. Just right from the first day, everybody was very friendly. First thing in the morning was a lecture giving us students the knowledge we needed for the day. Most of the day we spent with coding together with another student (always someone else). During this time you had very friendly and capable teachers by your side and no matter the problem, they took their time to explain it, giving the optimal support to learn something completely new. In the evening all students came together again and started the live code. In it, we all worked together on an exercise. This created a very nice and comfortable atmosphere. During the last two weeks, we worked on projects. The projects themselves are created from scratch and based on everything taught during the boot camp. Le Wagon provided us with the skills and the mindset shaping us into real web developers and with this knowledge we created some really amazing things. Le Wagon is undoubtedly an unforgettable experience and it also brings people from all over the world together.",coursereport
298,le wagon,2018-05-31,"My story Before joining Le Wagon coding bootcamp I was running an AdWords-agency for 5 years. Here, I shipped more than 200 landing pages on builders like PageWiz & Unbounce as well as on Wordpress to clients. So I was familiar with the tech and startup world but I just could not learn to code. I tried Codecademy and Udemy but did not follow through with the tutorials. How I learned about coding bootcamps The idea of attending a coding bootcamp had been in my mind since 2013, when I graduated from university and started the AdWords business. I briefly read about a coding bootcamp in my home city of Cologne, Germany. Yet I did not have the time and money to join then, and also later I never heard of this camp again. However, the idea remained on my bucket list. When I moved to Berlin in spring 2017 to participate in an accelerator program, I realized that lack of of tech knowledge in our team and thus a non-tech, non-scaling product was one of the reasons we got no follow up-investment. So I decided to change that and attend a coding bootcamp late 2017. Why I chose Le Wagon coding bootcamp Berlin At the time there were three coding bootcamps available in Berlin. I called them all. Only Le Wagon answered. I even emailed the other two, which I would not do normally, as I prefer direct contact and nevertheless: Nothing. Philipp, the Driver at Le Wagon Berlin however was spot on. I called him up and we arranged for a walk in the same day. I spoke with him but also with the students from the current batch and actually, I was already sold at this point. The atmosphere was just right. Concentrated and hard working, yet relaxed and laid back at the same time. Also it was more appealing to me that Le Wagon focused on future founders as much as on future developers as my goal was to get the knowledge for my next project rather then get a junior dev position. So if you favor building a real product with a real team in 2 weeks rather than exercising for job interview questions - this is the place to be. However, alumni who want to get a dev job also get it. The mix is roughly one third founders, one third hired as developer and one third going in to a product management or consulting role. So it's up to you to chose. Experience at the Bootcamp Le Wagon is the future of learning. It combines lectures which are actually your teacher coding live, rather than reading slides, peer programming with your buddy through the day and the best e-learning platform I have ever seen. You can literally follow the Wagon examples step-by-step and it will work. The way knowledge is taught at Le Wagon is just modern and how it should be. The complete opposite of our education system in schools and universities mostly stuck in and producing for the early industrial society of the 19th century. You can always ask a teacher to explain the problem and help you 1:1 when you get stuck. Stuff you would pay significant amounts for at places like Codementor. At the end of the day, the camp helped me to get over the initial threshold and start to code in Ruby, JS, SQL, HTML, CSS and then combine everything in Rails. At the end I built an Airbnb clone in one week and an MVP of a Job search site in two weeks with my team. Skills I gained Remember the scene from the Matrix when Neo wakes up and realises: ""I know kung fu"". Exactly that happened. I was able to go onto the developer and API sections of SaaS sites and understand what it is all about. I could finally consume the internet through the command line. Scraping data, using APIs to enrich it and outputting to the desired format. This was the magic I was doing. And I finally started my project: Automating online marketing A to Z from client onboarding, copy generation, landing page and ad creation for Google & Facebook. I built the first MVP of LeadConcierge in just three weeks. So I got everything and more which I could wish for. The community Actually, the biggest thing you get at Le Wagon is to connect with likeminded people. This is where the bootcamp overdelivers. Again, the staff at Le Wagon does a great job of connecting everybody in the group and forming friendships. Starting with a dinner for everyone on the first day and continuing until the demo day party on graduation. What’s more? In Berlin, free coworking is offered to alumni, so we can stay connected to the community and the following batches after the program while connecting to the over 3.000 alumni on a private slack platform. Here, tech advice, jobs etc. are plenty. Fun fact: While traveling in Silicon Valley I met a fellow alumnus from Brazil. So this is really a world wide community. Wrap-up Come for the tools. Stay for the network. If you read till this point you should imagine by now, that I loved my experience during and after Le Wagon in Berlin. I got all the skills I expected and friendships I really care about. I would recommend the camp to anyone willing to learn. It transformed the way I think and enabled me to finally build a scalable product. You want to know what I mean? If your only tool is a hammer, you treat every problem as a nail. Yet now I have a lot of different tools in my arsenal enabling me to think like an engineer and tackle problems with automation in a scaling way. And you will have too. Take my advice: Check out the Wagon events in your city or on Youtube and once you're ready embark on this journey!",coursereport
299,le wagon,2018-05-30,"LE WAGON advertises with the slogan “Change your life, learn to code”. For me this became absolutely true. The important thing to mention: Coding did not, but Le Wagon did! Here are 4 reasons why: 1. The teachers They are specialists in their field, travel the world to teach and even speak at conferences. On top of that, they are graded at the end of every batch, so it’s kind of a natural selection and only the best of the best survive. 2. The Buddy-System Every day, after having been taught the new content, you get a new buddy from the other classmates. This is a genius move, not just because you get to know all the class members very well (helps a lot for the final projects), but especially because it pushes the engagement of the entire class. No one wants to be the “loser that nobody wants to work with”. So as soon as you feel that you are behind, you put in even extra hours in the morning or the evening or the weekend. You can imagine what happens when everybody is doing that! Yes, it pushes performance to new heights! 3. The atmosphere You have team events, you have Friday beers (and free beer all the time) and through the buddy system new best friends for life guaranteed. We were 18 people from 10 different nationalities. The mix of cultures and backgrounds makes Le Wagon exceptional! 4. The Alumni Network I doubt that there is a course with a better network. To date, more than 20 locations worldwide. Thousands of alumni that all went through the “hell of Le Wagon” and that are crazily responsive for whatever you need help with. Le Wagon has Slack channels for jobs, events, growth-hacking tools … Whatever you need, the community will help you!",coursereport
300,le wagon,2018-05-30,"Coding is a skill i wanted to acquire for a long time. While life as a strategy consultant was thrilling and rewarding in many ways, a sense of monotony was sinking in over time - every (long) day was starting to look the same. Above all, I exceedingly felt like I wasn't doing enough - I wanted to be at the front line tackling and solving problems rather than taking the bird's eye view and finding rather high-level solutions. I enjoy self-learning and as such became passionate about the idea of learning how to code as one avenue to actually do more. I signed up to codeacademy and started learning front-end languages (html & css) whenever the job allowed. However, coding is like an endless sea - I felt overwhelmed rather fast because of the many languages out there, and the lack of knowledge as to how it could potentially all tie together at some point. This is when I gave up on trying it on my own and began searching for coding schools. A university friend of mine took the 9 week coding bootcamp at Le Wagon in Brazil a year back, so naturally I reached out to him. He offered unwavering praise for the class, so I decided to give it a go and applied for the batch due to commence in January 2018 in Berlin. 5 months later I can say he was 100% right. The bootcamp was worth it - something I found hard to believe beforehand considering the price tag of coding bootcamps these days. Spending 8-10 hours each and every day learning & applying concepts with the ability to ask as many questions as you like along the way was the perfect way to get off the ground in this endless sea of coding. After a month or so, I felt the equivalent of what young players in professional sports refer to as ""the game slowing down"" - concepts started to tie together and you'd start to really understand how frameworks (in our case ruby on rails) function from within. On a sidenote, the 9 weeks were not only a great learning experience, but also an incredibly fun time. Great people (with no exceptions!), evening get-to-togethers, fun activities and cocktail nights led to countless memories that will stay with me forever. Over the last 2 months since the bootcamp ended I've continued coding a few projects, the last being a successful coding challenge for a blockchain company. Quite honestly I am amazed by the progress that is possible in such a short time frame, and have Le Wagon and their wonderful teachers to thank for the getting me off the ground and triggering my curiosity to continue learning and getting better each and every day!",coursereport
301,le wagon,2018-05-30,"I studied business but always been interested in Tech and Entrepreneurship. After my bachelor before starting to think about what is next I wanted to learn something I have been always interested in but never really accomplished to fully understand - Coding. Through friends I heard of LeWagon and applied for Batch-92 in Berlin. The application process is super smooth and after a Skype Interview with Philipp I was admitted to the Bootcamp. The preparation was quite intense since you had to do a lot of courses online and had to start digging into the topic of coding. Fortunately, when the Bootcamp started many of the topics mentioned in the preparation were readressed. However, I can really recommend to do the preparation because otherwise it takes way longer to understand basic principles of coding. This is also one of the things I really really loved about LeWagon. I always struggled with coding since I had problems to make the step from understanding the principle to execute it in a real life example. And LeWagon made it so freakin easy. Every day started with a lesson about the topic of the day and afterwards you could directly apply the newly learned skills in numerous challenges that were sometimes hard but super rewarding. When you had a problem you could always ask your coding buddy (pair programming is awesome) or if there was no sight of the light at the end of tunnel you could just write a ticket and a TA came pretty swift to help you understand your problem and solve. It was never the case that you just got the solution. The teachers and TAs always tried to help you to solve the problem on your own. In combination with the real life challenges one really learned how to tackle problems on your own and to be indipendent in the outside world. Besides the great learning concept I want to mention three other things that I really appreciated during my time at LeWagon - People, Overall-Concept and Organization. We were a group of roughly 30 students and really became a well functioning group. Through the daily chaning coding buddies or the projects at the end of the Bootcamp you really got to know everyone. Besides that, several events and lunches increased the team spirit even more. The organization of the BootCamp was tremendous. Philipp, the driver, put every second of his time into making this BootCamp a tremendous success. He organized a lot of great events around the BootCamp, from Yoga-Sessions to talks with Developers and people from the Start-Up Scene. And that is also the point where LeWagon, in my opinion, stands out from other BootCamps. The whole concept is focused on not only learn how to code but also how to develop a promising product. This is one of the most helpful things when you head out to find a job as a product manager or developer. To summarize, LeWagon was a lifetime-experience that I never wanna miss and I can really recommend to everyone that are not only interested in learning a new skill but also how to apply this skill in products that customers love.",coursereport

After finishing the 9-weeks-bootcamp I can say for myself: it is really like that. Besides the obvious, that you get loads of information and knowledge in a very short period of time, I was amazed by the community le Wagon creates. Not only do you have lifelong access to all the slides and code, it also gets updated on a regular base and they add more and more online courses you can attend afterwards if you want to proceed your career as a developer. But not only that: we were 22 guys from 12 countries, we had students who just graduated school to a daddy from Greece with two kids. We had so much fun during and after the badge, a lot stayed in Berlin afterwards and we are still hanging out.

303,le wagon,2018-05-23,"I joined le Wagon Berlin 6 months ago. In retrospect, I’m fortunate to claim that it has been one of the best decision I have ever taken. For the context: We had just launched our startup and recently acquired market confirmation. We needed to scale up and therefore, update our MVP. Our original goal was for one of us to do the course in order to gain enough skills to be able to hire a CTO and/or manage a dev team. The bootcamp: You start learning the fundamentals of programming, moving onto front-end and design, wrap-it-up with Rails, the framework that puts everything together and finish up with 3 weeks of concrete project development. The starting weeks are intense but teachers are very dedicated to making sure you’re not left behind. However, you need to be fully committed to succeed and take the most out of it. It’s emotional payback time during the final project weeks when you figure out that you can build an entire web application from scratch when, 1.5 months ago, you thought that Java was an abbreviation for Javascript. After the bootcamp: I figured out I really liked to code and decided to build our new product. With the skills acquired you’re able to tackle all of it: Conception, design, development, server setup, testing, rolling out and maintenance. At that point, Le Wagon had further proven its value with its great community as I was always able to reach out to teachers and ask for advice. To wrap-it-up, here are some of the key aspects you gain after completing le Wagon: - Have an idea? Just build, launch and scale it! Ruby on Rails is very powerful to launch products very fast - More than just coding: Get notions of product management, design and UX, all set in a business perspective - Understand developers and learn to communicate effectively with them - Once you understand the fundamentals of programming, it’s easier to branch out to other languages - You’re part of a growing and very supportive community - Have access to great and constantly updated resources/learning material Side-note: For those worried about the perception that coding is for geeks, math enthusiasts etc. please put those thoughts aside, those are complete bullshit. Do yourself some good: Get enrolled, struggle first and succeed at last. You will learn very powerful and actionable skills in a very short amount of time while behind around great people.",coursereport

One of the most important things to highlight about Le Wagon is the community you join, which is second to none. If it is the number of different nationalities represented (14 in my batch alone) or the varying backgrounds of the individuals, everybody has an interesting story to tell. Regarding the coding - do not expect it to be sugar coated in any way! You will really have to commit yourself to Le Wagon and coding in the nine weeks ( the first three weeks are not called ""hell weeks"" for no reason ;) ). But if you really want to learn the basics of coding and are up for a challenge this will definately be the right course for you!",coursereport
305,le wagon,2018-05-10,"I’m a Parisian graduate in business. Since I’m out of college, everything has been aligned perfectly for me to pursue a great career in Finance. Everything, except that never felt right to me. Hence, for a year, I’ve been dedicating myself to purpose driven projects. But in each of these projects development, I found myself stuck on the same redundant reason: my lack of coding skills. Without these, there was no way to truly own the digital products I was working on. That’s why I attended LeWagon. As an autodidact, I tried first to learn how to code by myself. But I never succeeded to build anything serious, and I had the impression of losing my time attacking a field that seemed too big to handle on my own. Now I realize the odds were even bigger, and I can’t imagine how I could have succeeded without the intensity and the quality of LeWagon’s formation. LeWagon’s education logic is simple: learning by doing. However, that’s the way LeWagon pushes you to do that is incredibly effective. The courses are super clear, the TA’s were always pedagogue and motivating, the challenges get you to manipulate the concepts and really grasp them, the buddy system helps you accept difficulty and have fun with it, and the live codes are the sweetest moments to jump out from you comfort zone and realize the progress you made. Apart from the crazy nights we had going out with the batch, my favorite moments were also the last ones, during the project weeks. Those are the days when all of a sudden, you realize that you’re naturally doing what was unimaginable before. Seeing our team’s project getting concrete was a tremendous satisfaction. We rebuilt and dramatically improved one of my last year’s project: à European newspaper written by locals called Nationall. Surprisingly, I not only developed my coding skills but also my pitching skills, which I had to improve sharply for the demoday. I also discovered how to work in team with people coming from different background and cultures. All of it is both super interesting and ultra useful to be prepared for a professional environment. Now, I ended the bootcamp two months ago. After some deserved holidays, I’m still working with my teammates on our newspaper project to welcome our firsts writers and readers really soon. I’m also about to work as fullstack developer in a company to explore this new vast world full of possibilities. That’s how my conclusion takes us back to this post title; LeWagon broad up my horizon, it couldn’t have been the wrong choice.",coursereport
306,le wagon,2018-05-10,"As a classically trained graphic designer I love making things in my computer, and It was very surprising to me that my curriculum didn’t require scripting, code, or software design. After I graduated I began working as an art director for a global advertising firm, and eventually ended working for the digital side - where I got the chance to work on the creative side of web development. I realized how hard it can be to make awesome things if you don’t understand the technical capabilities of the technologies you’re using to build them, and therefore decided to learn to code. I began LeWagon without having any clue on how really life changing it would be. When you work in a creative field for a big corporation, you are very detached from ownership if what you make. Working for big clients or agencies, meant that i wasn’t really spending my time doing what I loved, MAKING COOL THINGS, but working my way around loopholes to get things approved - delivered - sold. Coding and LeWagon gave the back the power to really create value from scratch allowing me to make a living through building products that people are passionate about. I was impressed at the quality of people that was brought together by the bootcamp, and how different our backgrounds are. The community and collaboration approach to learning works wonders when you allow yourself to be immersed during the 9 weeks - and after that you will leave with a network of amazing professionals/people who you have shared a life changing experience with. I would recommend to anyone!",coursereport
307,le wagon,2018-05-10,"Attending the 9-week coding bootcamp at Le Wagon Berlin was one of the best decisions I ever made because it changed my life. With a background in journalism and cultural analysis I had no prior knowledge of coding. However, I wanted to change my career path and become a web developer. So when I stumbled across Le Wagon I first went to all of the free workshops they offered and spoke to staff and alumni before I decided to join myself. The programme is very tough (hence bootcamp) but the curriculum is really well structured. You start by learning the basics of Ruby, HTML, CSS and JavaScript before moving onto the Rails framework. In the last three weeks, you build two projects in groups and present your final project at a demo day. I didn't believe it was possible to learn coding in such a short amount of time, but it is amazing to see what you are able to learn when you commit time and passion to it and have competent people to guide you. The teacher at Le Wagon do an incredible job teaching the complexity of web development to absolute beginners and I have experienced them to be always helpful, patient and encouraging. Apart from the technical aspects, le Wagon has an amazing community. Our driver, Philipp, and our main teacher, Alice, organised a lot of evening activities and also workshops or talks to introduce us to the Berlin start-up scene. I also became really good friends with the people in my batch as well as the teachers and TAs and everyone was motivating and encouraging each other. Even though the programme was tough, I loved being there to learn coding. I am now pursuing my career as a frontend web developer and will never forget the unforgettable time and fun I had at le Wagon. Thank you for everything!",coursereport
308,le wagon,2018-05-10,"Having a background in law I had no idea of programming (besides some rudimentary HTML knowledge from school) and got to Le Wagon through their evening workshops. After my interest was sparked by these workshops I decided to go for the full-time bootcamp and I was not disappointed. The LeWagon Bootcamp is a thought through course from the didactical concept to the content of the lectures. Days start with a lecture in the morning followed by challenges which are solved by the students themselves. Thus, from day 1 you are challenged to solve problems and work practically. In the evening there is another live code session bringing together the whole group. The independent time is accompanied by teachers and teaching assistants who help with any upcoming question - a luxury you will not enjoy when learning on your own and which is extremely helpful as it speeds up your learning process. The structure of the classes do not only include coding basics but you also get taught in practical approaches on how to build a website from scratch. It was this holistic approach which convinced me choosing Le Wagon. This pinnacled in the two last weeks where you are building a website based on your idea from scratch. Additional to the curriculum we were provided with a lot of extra activities such as weekly talks with interesting persons from the scene, regular yoga classes and team building events. The people I have done the bootcamp with have become friends and besides the knowledge I gained it was also an incredibly fun time!",coursereport
309,le wagon,2018-04-18,"The decision I made to join Le Wagon was the best decision I have ever made. Previously I was working as an accounting-software-consultant and I had only 2 options. To continue the job which I did not like that much or to quit and be lost. But, Le Wagon changed my life in only 9 weeks. The course is super intensive and at the end of the course, I was able to build web applications by myself and ready to apply for junior developer positions. Best things about Le Wagon is that you meet great people from various background, and they are all super nice guys! Also, all of them are highly motivated to sophisticate their programming skills so that you will never be disappointed. After the boot-camp, I still work together with them to prepare for job hunting, go out for drinks (especially in Berlin you may experience intense Friday nights like I did but anyway) etc. Events such as alumni talks are useful in order to prepare for things you want to do, for instance searching for jobs, freelancing and so on.

It's very dense but pretty balanced and is built in a smart enough way that it's actually possible for students to keep up, even having very little prior knowledge. All about repetition and hands-on exercises. The contents of the course are suitable to allow someone to start in the AI industry. Many types of problems are covered, together with the different methods to tackle them, ensuring a good ability to start on those straight-away but also to know how to identify and research new ones. Additionally, unlike with many other courses, which tend to be a few years behind, the technologies introduced are actually modern and relevant, the kind that would be used in a real world setting. The material and assistance provided are of very high quality: Every topic comes with lecture notes that are just the right size, as well as cheat sheets, take-aways and resources for further reading, Exercises are very well set up so that they can be started on in a matter of seconds and without much room for mistakes, Instructions are clear and everything has been thought through and ahead, Teachers are mostly very good at answering questions and providing explanations during lectures, Teaching assistants do a great job at supporting students through the day, no matter the issue. Continued availability of resources. After the end of the bootcamp, all lecture notes, exercise repositories and flashcards remain available, as well as access to Le Wagon's wide Slack network, which seems a great asset in getting help, feedback, news or networking. This is a clear advantage compared to most other platforms. Minus points. There were very few negative aspects to my experience taking this Bootcamp. Some teachers weren't dynamic enough for me, which resulted in their lectures completely passing me by (but that might have just been due to my own capacity for attention, and didn't have any negative impact since notes were available). There were also some days where the evening recap lectures, instead of allowing to review and consolidate the sometimes heavy content of the morning, just added to it, leading to most students feeling very overwhelmed.

It's a very intense course where you learn immense amounts of concepts and tools while being fully supported by the teaching staff. The teachers and teaching assistants (these help you out during the day by answering the tickets you raise) are top-notch, all have gone through the same training and have worked for quite some time as developers, so you get great support and are constantly learning from different people, which is great because everyone has a different style and way of explaining things. The platform used is great: it's got lecture notes and slides, recordings for each lecture, solutions to the challenges, video tutorials, and flashcards that help you consolidate knowledge. The process has been perfected to such an extent, that there is really nothing to criticise. The program is worth every penny I paid. The group (there were about 30 of us) was very motivated, you get to know most of the people on your batch thanks to the randomiser that sets you in groups of four for every day of coding, and the group is different each time. The last two weeks are project weeks, and that is the best part of the bootcamp: you work as a team on a project you or one of the team mates came up with, and there's so much support, joint learning and good vibes in the process.

418,le wagon,2023-03-14,"Fast paced, challenging but thorough, comprehensive and very hands on. I learned so much during this bootcamp. You do need a solid maths basis if you want to be able to keep up. Also, learn Python beforehand.",coursereport
419,le wagon,2023-02-23,"I had a wonderful experience at Le Wagon. The curriculum is exactly what I wanted to find for many years, it provides students with a structure of the data science and data analysis field. I finally started to understand how different jobs and tasks are connected, and how and where to look for the information. Deep learning doesn't sound like a scary world for me anymore, and I feel confident working further on the topic by myself. Le Wagon gives you that confidence that you actually can do things if you find the right information. Regarding the job search, Le Wagon definitely gave me more skills in my cv, and my previously empty GitHub gained some projects. However, it still takes time and creativity to find an entry position for almost all students. The community is awesome, you meet many like-minded people who support each other in this early stage of career development and job search. Even after graduation we still gather to study and co-work together.",coursereport
420,le wagon,2023-02-20,"I am very happy about deciding on LeWagon for my Data Science Bootcamp. Definitely the most intense learning experience in my adult life. Coding every single day from 9 to 18 was only possible by insistently reaching for the support of our teachers and TAs. Redoing classic Engineering challenges after some years, but now with machine learning models, showed me how stimulating putting yourself up to date can be!",coursereport
421,le wagon,2023-01-15,"This training was a very good experience to get more comfortable with coding on Python, and to learn about machine learning, deep learning an data engineering, with a very dense curriculum. The TAs were always keen to answers to question and the ticket system to assist us when stucked on a given exercise was very helpful. The final project was a great opportunity to get a sense of what working on a data science project in team looks like, having to create a minimum viable product in a bit less than 2 weeks, thankfully with the support of TAs whenever we needed it!",coursereport
422,le wagon,2023-01-11,"Is the Data Science and Machine learning Bootcamp at Le Wagon worth It? A one word answer is Yes. However, it's only worth it if you have a game plan. This course is great if you have a background in coding, and if not, at least done a few Udemy, Coursera, Datacamp(or equivalent) courses in Python and Machine Learning. It's a bootcamp, so things move very quickly and if you don't have some experience it can be really tough, not impossible but difficult. To manage expectations, you probably won't become a data scientist straight away with this course alone, but it definitely will accelerate the process. With that being said, I was really impressed with how well the program was organised, how highly-skilled instructors and teaching assistants were and the high level of course material.",coursereport
423,le wagon,2023-01-06,"Before enrolling at LeWagon, I've done some research on the existing boot camps. I was following their social media for more than a year, I subscribed to their newsletters. I attended several free tutorials. I wanted to ensure that I would feel comfortable studying with these people and that they have the knowledge to transmit. From my perspective, Le Wagon had all of that. I switched to DS from linguistics with some programming knowledge and I was afraid of not keeping up with the curriculum, but honestly, Le Wagon makes everything for you to succeed and you just need to take your part of the responsibility and work hard :D. For my learning path, I chose a part-time schedule because of my full-time job. The advantage of it is that I could spend more time on subjects that I had some difficulties with. This curriculum gave me a strong understanding of basic concepts and an intuition of the field itself. 6 months of hard work resulted in wonderful AI projects that we were able to architect and code ourselves. The teachers and TAs were great as well, every time they managed to put into simple words difficult subjects. And in general, the staff of Le Wagon really impressed me: polite, nice, professional, and always there for you. The energy of Le Wagon is encouraging to learn and to network. After the BootCamp itself, we had a career week with great speakers and tons of valuable advice.",coursereport
424,le wagon,2023-01-04,Le Wagon is a perfect blend of intensive learning and challenges to help you get a full rounded education on Web Development. I would happily recommend this course to anyone that is interested in learning to code and has little to no prior knowledge of coding.,coursereport
425,le wagon,2023-01-03,"The Bootcamp of Le Wagon was right from the beginning very well organized. The admission process was fast and very friendly. Before the start all necessary information were shared to guarantee a smooth beginning on the first day. During the Bootcamp there is a lot a content to follow, but due to the lectures with the teachers in the morning and the exercise in the afternoon, which you can solve together with a buddy group and if necessary additional help of teaching assistants it is a lot of fun to dive into the topics. Learning how to code can feel a bit overwhelming at first, but Le Wagon is really taking care that you don't feel alone with it and will master it eventually. In the final project work you can work on real products and learn how to contribute on Github and do pair programming. There are a lot of additional activities to become part of the International community and meet like minded people. It was a really valuable experience and I can highly recommend.",coursereport

I really enjoyed the 9 weeks, I like the way the Bootcamp is structured, the learning and the different teachers we had.

I would highly recommend this bootcamp because in the last three weeks you also learn how to design, implement and deploy web apps as a team and how to work with your peers together on GitHub - which is so important to prepare you for your job as a developer.",coursereport
437,le wagon,2022-11-18,"I was a student of Le Wagon Berlin’s fulltime web development bootcamp and would definitely recommend it to anyone who would like to become a full stack developer. I learned a lot in a relatively short period of time and enjoyed it very much. As an experienced educator, I know how significantly the learning environment can affect the learning experience and outcomes. Le Wagon does a great job in providing an environment that facilitates concentration, dedication, and feeling of belonging. As a student, it was important for me to work with people who actually like doing their jobs. When the student perceives that the teaching team does not only care about the student, but takes joy in the activity itself, it is easier for them to engage in the activity. And it is not only the teaching team, but the entire Le Wagon staff work hard to not leave anyone behind in the process. They continuously track student progress and offer help in wide ranging ways to make those 10 weeks of the student go as smooth and productive as possible. I believe this demonstrates a healthy community spirit that is also reflected to the extracurricular activities they all do together. Le Wagon, probably like other bootcamps in programming, is also appealing considering the student profile it draws. The profile is astonishingly diverse, while most of these people are bright in quite different ways, partially on account of their past education and experiences. Le Wagon does a good job leveraging this diversity to create a community that anyone would find personally enriching.",coursereport
438,le wagon,2022-10-10,It was always a pleasant learning atmosphere. I have learned a lot in a very short time. The team at Le Wagon is great. The batch manager did a great job of accommodating all the students. The bootcamp is intense. A high level of comprehension and concentration are an advantage.,coursereport
439,le wagon,2022-10-06,"Before Le Wagon I tried also a cheap online corse and a free course in italy. But honestly both of them weren't that good. Before quiting my dream to change career and start working in the web dev fild I decided to try one last time. So I did my research, I started read reviews (also here) watch YouTube videos, look on reddit and make phone call to different Bootcamps, asking them their syllabus and other corse and post course related questions. I'm the kind of person that before spending a good amount of money on something need to be 100% sure it is worth it. And that how I arrived at Le Wagon. Before starting I was a little afraid, since I needed to do the course wile working (I did the part-time) + the course was online + I had a 2 months old baby at that time. And to be honest, I was right to be afraid. The course is challenging and you need to work on it, because learning something like coding is not a walk in the park. But how they structured the course, how they implemented the buddy system plus the Teachers and TA, made my coding journey great. ABOUT THE COURSE The course start with ruby and at beginning,, I know that ruby is not the most famous language out there. But I still thought that Le Wagon was a good choice. At the beginning I hated ruby, but now I have fell in love with it. It's easier to understand basic and complex concepts compared to other languages, but at the same time when you start learning new languages you find that they are not that complex anymore. Because you have already mastered the basics. A huge plus is that ruby on rails is fantastic! ABOUT THE BUDDY SYSTEM At the beginning of the course I was a little doubtful about this system for two reasons: one the course was online and two my English was not the best. But it's was actually really good. Thanks to the buddy system and the friendly Teachers after 2 weeks from the start of the course I already had the chance to meet and know better half of my classmates. It's nice to share some thoughts and opinions and find that everyone is coming from different places, different backgrounds but same love for coding. Even though the course is finished I'm already working on a new project with five of my classmates. That pretty much tells you how much you are able to bound during the course. And also this system helps you learn how to work in a team has a web dev, especially in the two main projects at the end of the course. ABOUT THE TEACHERS AND TA The teacher where simple great. Obviously they are really good at coding. But they where actually also really good at teaching. The course work with a ticket system, basically when you have a problem you can open a ticket and discuss with the teacher or the TA about the problem in is private zoom room. They try to help you in every possible way and explain you the possible solution as many time as you want. But the most important thing is that they were always nice and friendly. Never once I felt like they were annoyed, even when there were a lot of tickets or bugs to solve. That my experience at Le Wagon. I know that it can be difficult to make a choice and even more to stay motivated while learning something complex like programming, but whith a good environment and enough enough motivation it's possible. My only advice is don't be afraid and start this journey. And always keep in mind: ""Programming is a marathon, not a sprint.""",coursereport

The structure of the day really helps you learn as in the morning you do a lecture then the rest of the day there are exercises based on what you learned in the morning and throughout the bootcamp. It's unbelievable what you can learn in just 9 weeks. The teachers, TA's and other alumni really help you along this journey and they are what makes this bootcamp both fun and super informative.

It is structured to simulate real world working challenges, fully adapted to Berlin start-up scene, provides a lot of confidence after being through it. Especially, the last two weeks of the Bootcamp are dedicated to a guided project, where we had to come up with a topic and put into play most of the knowledge we gained during the lectures. I met smart, positive, helpful and creative people that were prompt to assist throughout the journey.

I felt that my university did not teach me the needed tech skills for today's economy, and I wanted to change that quickly. The Bootcamp was the perfect place to do that, and I'd do it again in a split second. All of us have learned more in those nine weeks than I could have ever imagined. If you think about it, do it! It is only nine weeks of your time, and you most probably won't regret it.",coursereport
469,le wagon,2021-12-15,"Joining Le Wagon must have been one of the best decisions in my life! It's unreal how much you can learn in only 9 weeks. The completely hands-on approach and fast pace of a bootcamp are different to everything we’ve seen before. The teachers and TAs were a huge support. Knowing most of them had been through the bootcamp themselves was a huge support as they knew the struggles we were all going through. Their patience and effort to explain us every single thing were impressive. Having a buddy system and pairing up with different students everyday was super cool, as we got to meet and work with different people, but also because it's much more efficient, as you end up explaining things to each other and figuring the challenges out together. One of the reasons I joined Le Wagon was the product-oriented approach they have. Being able to build two products from scratch in small teams, going from the UX/UI design, to the development behind it and finally pitching it on our Demo Day was amazing. The atmosphere at the campus in Cologne was just great, the staff is amazing and the views from our office are the best. I would recommend Le Wagon to anyone looking for a coding bootcamp. And of course would recommend Cologne if you're looking to do it in Germany - the vibe of the city is awesome! 🚀",coursereport

That’s why I decided to study Data Science. Choosing Le Wagon was a no-brainer for me since it is the best coding school & their approach was exactly what I needed - a hands-on Bootcamp where you can learn by doing challenges. In addition, some key competitive advantages I’d like to highlight are i) the Teaching Assistant support during challenges - that makes the difference if you're stuck with something you've never done before, ii) the continuous update of the lectures, challenges & program overall to be up-to-date in the field, and iii) their product-oriented approach - that makes the Bootcamp a pretty good approximation of the real working challenges, and hence, an easier landing in your next job :)",coursereport

You will learn a lot in a short amount of time. But you will have support from TAs anytime. Including some spiritual guidance from amazing and capable people in case you need it!. You will also have your daily challenges and a buddy to work with. This will be the implicit challenge not many are aware of: being open and communicative. Don't forget you are working with humans!

475,le wagon,2021-10-19,"Hi Everyone🖐 I'm Tim and I just completed the LeWagon DataScience Bootcamp this Summer in Berlin 📊👨‍🔬 Honestly speaking, it was -by a margin- the best experience I had in a while! After finishing my MA degree I was ready to kick off my career life in Asia, but due to the global pandemic and some unfortunate circumstances I had to give up my plans and return to my home country, where I was struggling to accept that my prior dreams had shattered. I needed to find a new direction and LeWagon gave me exactly the right impetus to push my life towards new goals - becoming a developer and finally finding the freedom that I seek! 🚌🌄 During the Bootcamp I learned enough about DataScience and overall programming to now work on projects that I never thought possible before, such as building trading bots that can generate a source of passive income. I have to say that the support, teaching style and overall organization from LeWagon has been excellent throughout the 9-weeks and even after graduation, I know, that I am now part of a community, that I can rely on if I ever run into problems. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 I would recommend the LeWagon Bootcamp to literally anyone, who is looking for an impactful challenge that can lead to a position in the tech industry.",coursereport

But at le wagon teachers patiently guide you to become an actual programmer. The teachers are very friendly and also professional. The mood in the classroom is chilled and feels like you are family, but at the same time you learn a lot and need to focus. But you want to focus because everybody motivates you. Additionally, programming is learning by doing and you do a lot of practical work. But it is very exhausting, too. The course gave me the ability to think about different ways to reach my goal.

477,le wagon,2021-07-27,"What can I say... the Bootcamp was a wonderful experience for me and at the same time an excellent opportunity to enter the world of coding and develop myself professionally on the technical side. With a background in finance and an affinity for startups, it was my intention to learn how to code for quite some time. After extensive research, I chose the Le Wagon coding Bootcamp. What I liked most about the Bootcamp was that besides the frontend stack you also learn 2 programming languages (Ruby and JavaScript - the first one is especially great for fast prototyping), that the program is very international, and that the curriculum is well thought out and builds on what you have previously learned. During the 9 weeks, no one was left behind and every single student was taken care of. This was especially ensured by a buddy system and teacher support (e.g. if you had questions about learned concepts or exercises). The highlights of the program are the project weeks, where the gained skills can be applied by building 2 web applications. There are basically no limits (only the time factor). In week 1 we built a platform to book technical support if someone is struggling with their code, and in weeks 2 and 3 (final project) we built a surfer app that gives a recommendation for surf spots based on current weather data and the experience level of the user. The environment is very motivating and at the same time, you get to know many new and interesting people. I can recommend the program to anyone who wants to learn serious programming and at the same time quickly get into the world of web development.",coursereport
478,le wagon,2021-07-27,"Before Le Wagon i was already working in IT as a product and project manager. Although i had basic understanding of programming and technologies around data i always wanted to dive deeper into this topic. There are many courses and bootcamps for Data Science out there, but i decided to go with Le Wagon, because it seemed to be an intense program. After the bootcamp i can say that it was the right desicion, because the Le Wagon Bootcamp has a great concept that makes it stand out from other courses. Here are 3 things that are especially worthy to be highlighted: Mass, quality, availability of material: Your first impression is probably gonna be, that the pace is way to high, but that's the goal. You go through a ton of material every day and its sometimes hard to cath up. Every topic will be introduced through a live lecture. But there is also a possibility to watch a prerecorded lesson and take a look into a script later. If the pace was to fast or something wasn't clear enough you can have a look at it in the future, because all the material will be availible for you even after the bootcamp. Teaching concept and community: Bacause the topics are new every single day it's pretty tough to get through the challenges without any help. So you have to collaborate. Challenges are designed that you solve them in collaboration with the teachers and other students and of course with the use of stackoverflow & co. There is also a lot of communication on the slack channels, so you really get to know many people and benifit from the huge international community. The final project: At the end of your bootcamp you can pitch you own project or join a project of other students. In two weeks (with support from teachers) you, as group of 4 students, will develop and deploy your own web application... and thats impressive. PRO Variety and depth of Data Science Topics. You get a great overview of the most important concepts of data Science, because of the high pace you can not really focus to much on one specific thing but you always have the oppertunity to look it up after the bootcamp, because all the lectures and exercises are still availible for you after the bootcamp. CONTRA If you do not like to be challenged and face adversity, bootcamp is probably not the right thing for you. If you do not have a technical background and no previous programming experience it can be a pretty rough experience for you on some days. But if you feel motivated, go for it nonetheless. Frustration management is a very important skill, especially in IT.",coursereport

Due to personal recommendations of friends, I checked out Le Wagon and immediately felt that this was exactly what I was looking for. This impression was confirmed when I had an initial chat with Rich, the driver at Le Wagon in Berlin. From my perspective, three points were particularly valuable about the Le Wagon experience: 1.) Very nicely structured programme, which challenges both experienced as well as totally inexperienced students to a degree that optimizes learning for everyone without feeling lost. They have implemented an awesome mix between morning lectures, which teach the fundamentals for the daily exercises, as well as subsequent challenges and live codes to apply the daily learnings and gain practical routine. 2.) Online additional resources and network Since the bootcamp has been around for quite some time now, there is an almost endless amount of additional resources to continue learning during and after the bootcamp. Also, Le Wagon now builds on a very strong community of more than 5k alumni which are very eager to help on coding problems etc. 3.)

I could apply to more schools and take an extra year to graduate, while repeating much of the same material, OR I could take advantage of knowing something about software and design, and take advantage of the time I suddenly had free, and join a coding bootcamp. I picked Le Wagon for a few reasons. They have great campus locations around the world, so I could pick the one closest to me. They offer a well rounded curriculum within a fair time frame of nine-weeks, making sure students are at least introduced to the topics employers are actively looking for. They advertised their alumni network, and with over 5000 alumni, you can be sure to always have a place to ask questions and make connections. After the bootcamp, they offered help with getting your first developer job, with resources at hand to help you have the best CV and the skills to write a killer cover letter. They can do all this, at a fair price point that makes my idea to go back to school seem almost laughable. But are the companies hiring on board? Actually yes! They even had a career day and introduced Students to companies in the area, letting us see what employers expected from bootcamp graduates. We could immediately judge just how much progress we can make in 9 weeks and how ready we were to start a career in web development. If you are able to work hard to achieve your goals, and aren't afraid to end up dreaming in Ruby, then I strongly suggest you consider Le Wagon.

My undergraduate degree was in secondary education and I spent the first years of my professional life as a high school history teacher. I knew I needed a change, and Le Wagon was exactly what I needed. I read many of these reviews on CourseReport when determining which bootcamp would be a good fit for me, and found the rave reviews for Le Wagon to be well-founded. It was one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my life. Le Wagon provides an abundance of support and resources - one-on-one teacher assistance, daily paired-programming challenges, group programming challenges, and optional reboots for students, like me, who felt as though they would benefit from additional support in learning key fundamental concepts. Additionally, my experience at Le Wagon taught me how to learn a language and to think like a developer, which has proven to be extremely helpful as I have started to branch-out post-graduation. Le Wagon was wonderful experience and continues to be a supportive community as I transition into a role as a junior developer.If you’re still on the fence about which coding bootcamp might be the right fit for you, I strongly encourage you to reach out to Le Wagon - you will not be disappointed.",coursereport
487,le wagon,2018-11-13,"At some point in 2017, I decided I want to become a developer. That was the easy part, the ""what"". The hard part was yet to come: ""how""? With my goal in sight, I spent hours upon hours googling, trying out some free online courses and asking friends how they became developers (without realising, I had already learnt the first fundamental lesson for developers: how to google!). After some consideration, I went out on a limb and quit my job. Luckily, my girlfriend had taken part in one of Le Wagon's free 1-day courses and told me how incredibly challenging and rewarding it was. Great! I had my first real lead and, guess what, I googled them. All of it looked really promising and I was ready to go. It was when I saw the price that I had second thoughts. The main thought swirling in my mind was whether Le Wagon was just really good at marketing (they are) and just didn't have enough substance (boy was I wrong). ""Would the teachers really care about the progress I made?"", ""Will I find it rewarding and challenging?"" and ""Will it really help me?"". I soon realised there was only one way to find out and no amount of googling would help me anymore. Geronimo! It turns out, the answer to all three questions was a definite YES. From day one, the teachers were really helpful and showed such passion for teaching. Was it challenging? Wow, I am not sure if I have ever had a more challenging time in my life, but it paled in comparison to what I learned (and when you complete a task without errors, it is immensely rewarding - thanks rubocop! Plus, it helped me immensely, rocket-propelling my desire to become a developer to heights I couldn't have hoped for before. And the best of it was that it didn't feel like a bootcamp or school. Everyone was in it together and we all helped each other out, whether student or teacher. So if you are having any second thoughts, go try out one of their 1-day courses. There is a reason they do them. And if you like what you see, I highly recommend to sign up and just join the Le Wagon community.",coursereport
488,le wagon,2018-10-17,"As a philosophy student, I had a few creative ideas that I hope to develop, but was unable to due to my lack of technical skills. In 9 weeks, Le Wagon gave us an insight into what it's like to materialize an idea. The bootcamp is divided into two stages - the first stage consists of learning the basics of Ruby, Javascript, CSS, SQL, and other tools, and the second stage consists of applying what we’ve learned to practice (i.e. develop websites using what’ve learned!). As an aspiring product manager/entrepreneur, the second stage was especially helpful since we learned how to pitch ideas, measure the feasibility of developing an idea in a limited amount of time, create user-journeys, design prototypes for website, and work as and with developers to create websites. We were constantly supported by hardworking and patient teaching assistants and other students despite all the mental struggles! Also, I came to the bootcamp with a biased pre-conception that developers are antisocial; this presumption was totally reversed by the end of the first day! Everyone was very open-minded and social. Le Wagon also makes sure that we get the chance to know everyone in the bootcamp - each day, we are paired up with a new buddy with whom we cooperate to solve daily coding challenges. Personally, I consider this the best part of the bootcamp because I was not only able to cooperate with people from diverse backgrounds, but was also able to see how each person think differently by taking different approaches to solve a problem! Le Wagon also organized quite a few career talks with product managers, entrepreneurs, and developers - I was able to gain perspectives on what I might be interested in doing after my studies by learning about work experiences of invited speakers, classmates, and alumni.

Le Wagon is a nine weeks program providing you with a solid toolkit of skills to build web-apps and APIs. You start by learning Ruby, and continue with SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The students are very diverse and come from lots of different backgrounds, countries and age groups. At the end of the bootcamp you'll programm together with two to three other students two entire web-apps in just three weeks time - and this feels amazing and super rewarding! I really enjoyed my learning experience with Le Wagon. My initial goal was to learn some basic coding during my gap year between graduating business school and starting my master's degree. At the end of the course I learned so much more than I hoped for and decided to scratch my plans for the gap year and master's degree in favor for pursuing a coding career. By now I am working as a fullstack developer in a Berlin Startup. The Le Wagon staff consists of mostly former Le Wagon students, which is why they are great at motivating and explaining the concepts. I did struggle with coding, especially in the beginning, but since they went through the same experiences they always had great advice and encouraging words.

The most rewarding point in the programm is when you reach the final weeks and get to build up a project from scratch with a team of your choosing.

492,le wagon,2018-05-10,"I decided to take part in Le Wagon in January in Berlin. Why ? Because in my two main professional experiences - 1 year as an entrepreneur and 6 months in a chatbot agency, I’ve been very frustrated not to be able to communicate properly with developers and to build my own projects. Also, in both these experiences, I realized I didn’t want to be limited to sales or marketing roles, and that I would like to be more product-oriented (product manager for example). At that point I’ve had just finished my Master in a French Business School and I didn’t want to spend more years studying ! A 9-week coding bootcamp was for me the best time-to-outcome ratio. The program is very well packaged: you first have 20-30 hours of video content before the bootcamp to get comfortable with the main concepts and then you start the 9 weeks with an intensive but still agreeable rhythm. The course is based on the learning-by-doing method (which I consider the best method to learn) : 1 hour and a half of lesson in the morning and then exercises all day ! It finishes with a live code when the students are challenged on new coding exercises. Every morning you learn brand new concepts that you have to apply immediately.The exercises have gradual levels, you will start very simple and then it will get more and more complicated. The teachers know at what level you are and provide really personalised help. The whole program is made for you to improve every day and you have the feeling that you can actually accomplish something pretty quick. The most impressive part is the platform on which you work, it’s super advanced. Every lesson, videos of the lectures, exercices, corrections are available on it and there is a lot ! The projects part in the last three weeks is the best time when you can actually apply what you’ve learned. Plus you will figure out how to get organized as a team, to collaborate on a project and to get it live - which is basically the job of a full-time developer. So at the end of the project weeks, you have a functioning first website and a good idea of what it’s like to be a developer. Regarding what happens next, I personnaly stuck to my first idea so I’ve looked for a product management position. I landed a great job at Delivery Hero (Rocket Internet) as Global Product Operations Specialist, not even 2 months after Le Wagon ! I definitely feel more confident about discussing the architecture of a project, putting my hands in the code and solving technical problems. And all that thanks to Le Wagon ! I also spend some time on a personal project on the side to keep my coding skills. Overall it was an amazing experience ! I talked a lot about the coding aspects but I also want to mention that other students were great people. The atmosphere is really about good vibes, we spent time together after work and we knew when to celebrate our accomplishments.

I was bored and I felt like a machine doing my job, it wasn't rewarding anymore and I didn't see the result of my work. I did a little bit of research and joined some meet up groups until I stumble upon Le Wagon in Berlin, where I currently live. After a couple of meet ups with them, I realised that I really enjoyed coding. I spoke with some of their students and was surprised to learn that some of them didn't have any technical background at all, just like me. I was always curious to learn how things work and found that coding will be the perfect place to find that out. After a lot of thinking I decided to join the bootcamp and was very happy when I was accepted. I decided to quit my job and start a new chapter in my life as developer. I enjoyed every single day of the 9 weeks bootcamp, every day I woke up looking forward to the new challenges we'll have at school, and was amazed to see how much you can learn in just 9 weeks. I found that the buddy system they use is simply great, as working in pairs really help you understand the problems and as the teachers say, ""If you are able to explain something is because you fully understand it"" and is absolutely true, so having your buddy of the day as your rubber duck really help you go through the problem and discover where you might have difficulties. During the bootcamp we had few visits from ex students that told us about their experiences after the bootcamp and that gave me the opportunity to learn about the job market and specially what to expect when applying for jobs, sharing their tips and advices. We also had the visit of few HR specialists that shared with us the dos and don'ts when writing your CV and Cover Letter and share their professional advice.

Cela dit, un format un peu plus progressif – par exemple à mi-temps – aurait peut-être permis de mieux ancrer certaines notions sur le long terme, laissant plus de temps pour assimiler entre les sessions.Un vrai plus : la gentillesse et la disponibilité des TA, toujours là pour accompagner avec bienveillance. Les échanges, parfois même sur des sujets un peu hors programme, ont été très formateurs.L’équipe a su créer un cadre chaleureux et détendu, même en online. Gather Town a été un super outil pour favoriser les rencontres et les échanges informels, notamment lors des événements d’intégration en ligne. Ça a vraiment facilité la cohésion du groupe.Je recommande sans hésiter.",coursereport

So I was looking for a bootcamp that allows me to learn fast, gain hands-on coding experience but to also stay accountable through regular check-ins. The bootcamp at Le Wagon was the right one for me as the mandatory morning lectures and evening live-coding gave me the regular schedule I needed and the coding in-between in groups gave me the flexibility and community I wanted to work together on problems and gain experience. Content-wise my expectations were definitely exceeded. I expected to learn data scraping, machine & deep learning and got introduced to the whole universe of data science with the opportunity to work and understand the basics in everything and learn further in the future - either by re-doing the course work or starting from there. When I say basics I also mean that we dived really deep into each topic (so making sure you learn the python basics in the pre-week is really important), sometimes a whole university semester in one day.

610,le wagon,2022-12-23,"As you might have read by many other reviewers online, a coding bootcamp experience can turn your professional life around. My experience at Le Wagon Berlin couldn't have validated this point more! For 10 weeks (9 weeks of face-to-face learning + 1 week of coding prep-work), I faced coding challenges I never knew I could solve. While having had some coding experience prior to the bootcamp, the real key to solving these challenges was Le Wagon's systematic approach to teaching. That said, the extensive tech and coding experience of both the lecturers and TAs was equally invaluable in this regard. While I might have taken away more about some fields in data than others, this was largely due to personal choice. Indeed, although the bootcamp centralizes the use of skills common to data science, we were introduced to skills needed for both data analysis and data engineering. Given my initial desire to skill-up in data analysis, I ended up focusing more of my attention on lectures pertaining to this field than others. If I were to utter any sort of critique about the bootcamp, it would relate to the point above. Finding a job as a data scientist right after the bootcamp will be a challenge for most people - especially for those with no experience in tech or quantitative work. Most people will start as data analysts or engineers and slowly work towards roles in data science. The bootcamp certainly delivers on its promise to introduce students to the current standards in data science, but in light of this reality, students should be aware of the skills needed for a start in the data world and prepare accordingly throughout the bootcamp. This is, of course, less of a critique about Le Wagon's programme, but rather a word of caution to anyone who is looking to start a highly specialized bootcamp as such. I can whole-heartedly recommend Le Wagon's data science bootcamp, and would do it again if I could!",coursereport

I really liked how we were specifically guided towards best practices and learned how to code the correct way which will be important when looking for a job in the tech industry. There also a career week in the end which helped me a lot! But the most important thing about Le Wagon was and is the amazing community which you will stay part of for the rest of your life!

The LeWagon curriculum is incredibly well organized and just perfect for absolute coding beginners. The 9 weeks are intense but it's a super fun experience and the teachers are great. It really is a community and you can feel that the teachers are passionate about coding and want you to learn the skill.

I chose the flex schedule which means I should be able to work at my own pace. Unfortunately, the tutor I was assigned to usually takes 3 to 4 days to respond. When I do have time to work on the course, I'm unable to because my coursework sits for days at a time waiting for my tutor to review. Exercises build one upon another, often having you delete old code and re-working things with new frameworks or libraries. Making it impossible to move on without the tutor reviewing. When I first reached out to the advisors about potentially falling behind due to these consistent delays things got worse. I'm about halfway through the course and officially falling behind schedule. I sent another message to the advisors about my situation becoming worse with the unresponsive tutor and currently waiting for another response. Hopefully, I can get a new tutor or some time added to my schedule, again. After reminding my tutor that he has 24 hours to respond or review exercises he has decided to start fighting with me over whether he has to respond saying he has students turn 5 assignments in in a day.

I will say that on the UX course the resource articles are a little out of date, some having been published back in 2017.

The entire curriculum was exceptionally well-structured, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all aspects to truly make you an expert in analytics. Moreover, it emphasized creating the best possible portfolio to help you achieve your goals. The mentors and tutors are highly knowledgeable, with impressive backgrounds in the industry. They are incredibly supportive throughout the course, going above and beyond to assist with each assignment. Their commitment to pushing you to excel was commendable, constantly raising the bar with every task. I must also acknowledge the student advisors who consistently reached out and ensured that my course experience is excellent. Their attentiveness and dedication to making sure everything was going smoothly is greatly appreciated.

636,Careerfoundry,2023-06-28,"The course materials are really good, with additional resources for further reading to help me understand the topic being discussed. It's good that they provide examples of how certain tasks are done so I will have an idea o how to approach the task expected of me to do. However, they need to make sure that the demo examples are correct become there were a few that does not really match how the tasks are supposed to get done correctly and as students, we tend to model our work based on the examples given. Another thing to point out is the allotted time for each task. Sometimes, the time estimates given per task are not very realistic. They need to consider that not all students are the same, not everyone absorbs what they read quickly and not everyone has a set of technical skills to meet the timeframe. I remember doing a few tasks which says 4-6 hours but in reality, there is no way I can finish them at that rate, especially if I had to interview 3-5 people, arranging the interview alone takes time plus the amount of time you spend gathering and organising the data and making a presentation. Other than that, I am really enjoying this course, my mentor and tutor are really awesome. Mohit is very encouraging and helps me to push myself to finish my tasks on time. Rachel has always been amazing, very thorough with her feedback and you can tell they she is actually taking her time in assessing my work.

The lectures are 30-45 minutes long and the exercises truly provide a foolproof way to understand if you learned what you studied. The CareerFoundry staff is responsive and helpful and never makes you feel alone.

643,Careerfoundry,2023-05-10,"Initially I enrolled to improve my data analytical skills particularly in SQL, Tableau, and Python, but fortunately I got the opportunity to learn a lot more than that. I appreciate having an assigned tutor, mentor, and career specialist to ask questions and get personalized responses in a timely manner (within 8-16 hours). All three were detailed in their feedback on my assignments, and gave me useful tips for improvement in the future. I also appreciated that they're practitioners in the field, so I got a ""real-world"" perspective as it related to the fundamentals we were learning throughout the lessons. The lessons were broken down in a clear and easy-to-follow manner, so it's definitely doable for beginners and those who looking for a career change. Though there were definitely some challenging lessons for sure, they were never unreasonable for a student. While I'm not currently looking for a career change, I'm still participating in the job preparation portion of the course as it provides great tips and tools I may be able to use in the future.

As there wasn’t a degree option relevant to my job, I pitched the Digital Marketing program at Career Foundry which I’d found while doing extensive research. It had great reviews and I had a phenomenal experience with my Admissions rep. Learning about career guarantee, the specialization, and the ability to have access to other courses made it even better. The company didn’t support the idea so I was let go and I immediately enrolled in the UX Design program. I’ve been in it for 2.5 months now and have absolutely no regrets.

The UX Immersion Program is easy to follow, super-intensive, and full of one-on-one support. Most online programs do not provide one-on-one mentorship and tutoring guidance which I would say is CareerFoundry’s biggest strength. I don’t know where I would be without my Tutor and Mentor and I’m excited to continue my journey to becoming a true UX Designer.",coursereport
648,Careerfoundry,2023-03-16,"I started my CF program in UI Design on January, 2022 and finished it on January, 2023 so it took me a little longer than I expected to finish but I did so with a full-time job. Before getting into the CF program I started learning progressively with youtube videos, then Coursera courses and finally CF program. This way I made sure I was making the right choice in my career change journey into Tech from Aviation. I can't stress enough how good this program is and I have a bachelors in mechanical engineering. CF gives you literally everything you need to do a career change. You will get a tutor and a mentor that are experienced (and working) in the industry and after you finished the program they provide an invaluable course on job preparation that gives you all the tools you need to find that first job. Also, you get a mentor for your job prep too. CF will give you all the tools you need to have a successful educational transition into the real world of tech but it requires the students effort to make it work. This is a 50/50 deal and it can only work if you take every suggestion and implement it. They know what they are doing but without proper student execution it wont matter. Be ready to study hard and give it your all and take every single course from the introductory ones to the job prep, it is really worth it. After I finished my course I found my first job in 6 weeks. Some context, I'm new in town, no prior industry experience, the job market at the time of this review is awful with tech companies laying off people by the thousands, and it is a 100% remote job at a great company that I like. All in all, I can't recommend CF enough as my experience was great from start to finish and it's paid off. Also, I got a better salary now as a first-time designer than at my previous career with a decade of experience. If you are sure about the new career path that you want to take, this is a great way to get to the job you ultimately want. Just remember to make that extra effort so it works.

I haven't received job assistance yet since I am still in the main program, but it looks promising!",coursereport
652,Careerfoundry,2022-12-15,"I started the course very perfectly and was happy learning frontend and basics. When I started the Full Stack Immersion, my first mentor couldn't help me because he didn't know what he was talking about. It seems like he didn't know anything about javascript. It took a month for him to help me with a simple issue with one of the features of a simple project. My second mentor was better, but the material was poorly updated or explained. I had to book a call with my mentor to explain some materials, and since he was super busy, it took a week or more to get help each time. After all, one of the reasons that I got this course with CareerFoundry was the job guarantee. Basically, without any experience and a related university degree, there would be no chance of getting a job, and collecting the requirements for getting a refund is a full-time job itself. I DO NOT recommend this school/Bootcamp to anyone who doesn't have related experience or degree. I applied for many jobs in many companies in the US and only got one interview in 7 months, and still no job.",coursereport
653,Careerfoundry,2022-11-28,"Overall, it's a great class and I love my tutor and the mentor that I've been paired up with. They are super helpful and do everything they can to help you figure things out. My only complaint is that a lot of the course work was written in 2020, and many of the dependencies you'll be using have been updated (several times) since then, making it difficult to use some the code that they give you in the course material. You often will have to go your own way to figure out how to reach the end, instead of the way they intended you to take. That said, I feel I am better equipped to debug issues than someone who didn't have that experience, since I've had a lot more bugs than someone who took this class when the material was written. I can't rate the Job Assistance program yet as I am still in the program and have not started looking at jobs.",coursereport
654,Careerfoundry,2022-11-09,"I am genuinely excited to review my experience with CareerFoundry so far! Let me give a quick intro about myself. My name is Meenu and I am from India. I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Physics. During my penultimate year at university, I decided to change careers into UX design and quickly started researching short courses and bootcamps that I could afford at the time. Shortly after that, I read a medium article review of the UX design boot camp program at CareerFoundry and I was immediately hooked. I continued to research more about the program and the curriculum. Later, after comparing different boot camp programs regarding their curriculum, fee, and job opportunities after completing the program, I decided to go with CareerFoundry as it turned out to give me the most value for the fee that I am paying. Also, compared to so many other boot camps, I find the course fee at CareerFounry to be the most affordable for a 10-month program. Something that attracted me to choosing CareeFoundry is that they are committed to providing a human-centered experience. I have been assigned a wonderful mentor and tutor who have given me immense support and encouragement from the beginning. I enrolled in the program even before I completed my degree and because of that, I had taken some time off in between. Both my mentor and tutor were truly supportive of this and later when I started doing the course full-time, they keep providing me with the most genuine feedback on every task that I have completed so far. It has been a truly grateful experience to have such great designers who have a lot of experience in the industry. As a career changer, it has definitely helped me move forward in this journey with courage and confidence. The curriculum is one area that I would like to see improved. The curriculum, in my opinion, is more focused on theory and writing, and sometimes there seems to be a lag between tasks. Considering this is purely my personal opinion, it is possible for other people to have different opinions than mine. Last but not least, I can't conclude this review without mentioning my Student Advisors. Everyone is truly kind and supportive. I know from my own experience that they work truly hard to solve our issues without wasting any time. I am so glad to have the amazing Student Advisors that I have to share this journey with.",coursereport

I believe the course gives you a very solid foundation to build off of. I would definitely suggest spending time researching on your own, and building your community on LinkedIn as there are so many people willing to teach and assist on there as well. Career Foundry teaches you the fundamentals of how to do projects, start to finish, while executing presentations that are visually appealing. You have a mentor and tutor to help you along the way to answer questions and meet with you. And they have a good community on LinkedIn and Slack that are always willing to help as well. Definitely recommended! I had a few friends in analytics review a few bootcamps and they all pointed to this one for a few main reasons: 1) It establishes a portfolio that presents your final work and shows off your skills 2) you have a good community to assist and help when you have questions 3) there is a job guarantee that comes with a career specialist to help you prepare, present yourself, and interview well.",coursereport

The theory and exercises on each chapter build on the previous ones so you get a cohesive result at the end of each section. Individual studying beyond the scope of this course is necessary to learn more complex applications of the abovementioned skills. My mentor and tutor have been helpful and they reply quickly when I text a question. Good experience so far.",coursereport
657,Careerfoundry,2022-08-31,"I've gotten through just over half the course. The first half was pretty good, I was absorbing lots of information and putting it into practice. But at the halfway point things got weird. The reading materials didn't cover the topic (React) very well, and the few (short) videos were basically just repeating what was in the text. I think if you have a good mentor and tutor, your experience will be positive. I haven't been so lucky, I went through 3 mentors who either disappeared, didn't show up for calls, or told me to figure things out on my own ""because it's a better learning experience."" So, what am I paying for? My tutor seemed to copy and paste all his feedback, because when I messaged him he didn't seem to understand my questions, I guess English was a language barrier. For me, it's not worth the cost, so I'm dropping out. I hate to miss the job search support, because I think my career coach was actually going to be good, but I can't justify paying so much for unclear reading materials and unhelpful mentors.",coursereport

663,Careerfoundry,2022-07-13,"I am almost towards the end of the immersion now, and am feeling really confident with how CareerFoundry has prepared me for the UX field. The intro to UX course gives you a quick look into with the different parts of UX, so you can get a taste of all of it before you really dive in. The immersion course expands heavily on what you learned in the intro, and you are prompted to choose a project that will become your main case study for the immersion course. CareerFoundry shows you your timeline progress, so you can visually keep track how far along you are in the program by weeks and by tasks. It is very independent work, so self-motivation is big. The lessons are detailed and provide you with plenty of information to understand the topic they're teaching you, and there are always extra links to articles so you can go even more in depth. There are weekly submission goals that also shows your expected program and time finish that help to keep you on track. This has helped me become more disciplined and stick to the deadlines so I either submit according to my expected timelines. I also really really love that they show you how long a task might take, like 1-3 hours or 10+ hours. I like to plan ahead so I really love this feature. If you don't like your mentor or tutor, you can also always request a change. I was nervous I wouldn't connect with mine but it's quite the opposite. My tutor is great! I really want to highlight how much I love my mentor and our extremely valuable video calls - she's very encouraging but also highly critical. She's the head of a large (like 40+ member) UX team at a major grocery store company and always provides me with honest feedback and ways to improve my portfolio, telling me what she'd be looking for when hiring for her company. I doubt myself and put a lot of pressure upon myself, but I always leave our calls feeling sooo much better and that everything will be okay! I haven't started the job prep course yet, but I am in it, so I can see that they help you develop your identity (in the context of what you're passionate about) and clean up your portfolio and resume. I know this is definitely assistance I need, so I'm glad to have it. Interestingly enough, the user experience of the CareerFoundry website is ... lacking lol. It works fine but sometimes, I find myself laughing clicking around because it makes no sense that a website hosting a UX design course has such unintuitive UX. CareerFoundry, if you're reading this - pls conduct research with your own students, tutors, and mentors! I remember reading through Course Report obsessively, trying to figure out if I should go into UX and if I should choose CareerFoundry... So if you're wondering if UX design is right for you... Do you like studying human behavior (psychology)? Do you love comparing products to find the best one? Do you enjoy solving problems and thinking critically? Do you enjoy divulging your thought processes behind what you do? Then go for it :-) (bonus points - this one might be hard for a lot of people, but is crucial for UX - you will have to learn to let go of your ego and be objective - you cannot be stubborn with your designs. It's part of what I love about UX design - your work will always evolve and get better, as long as you take in and adapt to the feedback you get) I was in between multiple programs and absolutely hate having regrets. But I am really glad with my choice. I'm (naturally) nervous for the job hunt but I genuinely feel so much more confident and excited to enter this field now thanks to CareerFoundry <3",coursereport

There are plenty of resources, they prepare you for job interviews, make your porfolio and to find a job. You will never feel alone doing the course. It’s not that kind of course that you complete tasks alone without any contact with a tutor. You will have a tutor and a mentor to guide you in the industry. Absolutely recommended.",coursereport
666,Careerfoundry,2022-07-13,"Coming from a non technical background, I enjoyed the variety of topics it covers. Career Foundry did a good job in picking on-demand technologies. The training is mostly understandable and only need update in some sections to the newest release or splitting some of the tasks. The community I find valuable and we learn from each other even though we live in completely different places. The career coaching is also a great deal and itself worth a lot. Consists of a course with several tasks to improve your professional appearance aswell as a dedicated career coach. Over all I feel like being prepared for a lot of topics and it is on me to deepen the knowledge! I would recommend, though to visit a few online courses about the basic HTML, CSS an JavaScript.

668,Careerfoundry,2022-06-28,"I am almost halfway through the UX Design Program and I love it. I've done other online courses, even in UX, which gave me a good understanding of the field, but this course is very much deeper. You have two parts: the intro part, where you learn almost every part of UX casually - this is where a lot of other courses end - and then the second, immersive part, where you pick a project that you work on. In this part you learn everything a UX Designer needs to know and almost everything will be covered by Tasks, you have to submit. With every task you can see what a few other students have submitted - so if you don't understand the assignment, you can then get an idea. This helps a lot. From Day 1 you have a tutor and a mentor. When you are halfway through you can do the job preparation course, where you get another mentor, who helps you prepare for your first job. I can't say much about this, since I am not there yet. But my ""normal"" mentor already helped me with questions about jobs and work. The course is parted in little sections and it's viable to do like 4-5 tasks a week (full-time). I can recommend it.",coursereport
669,Careerfoundry,2022-06-28,"As a fan of independent learning, I can strongly vouch for Career Foundry. By ""independent"", I do not mean you are alone: your tutor and mentor will help you with any questions you have, and there is a whole community of other students to work with. The point is that you can learn at your own pace, spend more time on aspects you find challenging, and take whatever approach to learning suits you best. Of course, this means you are responsible for structuring your time, and this is an important skill as well. It's a bit lonely if you don't reach out to connect with study buddies (which may be something you do or don't want to do), and you get help from your tutor via messages, so it is not the same as a classroom. You CAN book video calls with your mentor, which is great, but this is for more high-level guidance than everyday learning. The staff are very supportive and encouraging. I hope this review gives you some insight into what to expect, but I can certainly recommend Career Foundry and am very grateful this opportunity is here for me to take this path. If you want to study UI, go for it!",coursereport
670,Careerfoundry,2022-06-27,"After a very good research I choose to study at CareerFoundry and since april I'm making my career transition with them, loving it! They are very attentive and the way of learning by making my portfolio is a differential. My course's mentor and tutor are senior professionals with good teach skills and very supportive. I recommend!",coursereport
671,Careerfoundry,2022-06-08,"Overall my experience here at Careerfoundry has been great. I have been able to complete 2 out of the 6 achievements involved in phase two and really feel like I am being prepared for a future in UX design. I am being immersed in the language of UX, learning the main functions and responsibilities of my position and learning how to imagine myself in the context of a product development team as a whole. I have especially loved getting to know my Mentor. She is very smart and has a proven career in UX, and I really admire her and her decisions in this field. I want to contribute getting to know her and seeking her out for quality advice even after this program. I also loved getting to know my first tutor. We we’re able to connect on LinkedIn outside of careerfoundry and I find it invaluable to see the people teaching me live their lives. I love seeing how they interact in this world.",coursereport
672,Careerfoundry,2022-06-08,"This course has exceeded my expectations. The material is clear and comprehensive, and the resources available to students (mentor, tutor, and career services) really make you feel like you have someone to reach out to when you need help, and you are supported. The self-paced setup is also so wonderful, as you can take the course as slow as you need, or pick up the pace when you have time/if you want to finish sooner. Overall, this course is very well designed and organized, and the material is easy to read and understand.",coursereport
673,Careerfoundry,2022-06-08,"This course is not worth the money at all. Majority of the exercises are all very out of date and they refuse to want to update them. The company seems to like to focus on their UX/UI students more than anyone else, and all the information they have on their slack channels is geared towards them with very little if anything geared towards the developers. The job guarantee is nearly impossible to fulfill as well and is more like a full time job and prevents you from actually focusing on getting a job if you want to be able to get your money back.",coursereport
674,Careerfoundry,2022-05-31,"Before choosing a UX Design Bootcamp to assist me in my career change plans, I reviewed all the options available from Germany and decided on Career Foundry because of three reasons: 1. The curriculum seemed well thought out and organized 2. The website and short trial course had the best UX experience in itself compared to other courses/ schools 3. the career assistance program All three were proven correct. I am very satisfied with my choice and the course as a whole. I did have to apply myself fully to my studies and it was a quick pace (I studied fulltime). My tutor and mentor helped my a lot with their feedback on my projects and tasks. I was able to find a new job in UX within 2 months after graduating. I started job search before graduating and found the support of my assigned career coach very valuable.",coursereport
675,Careerfoundry,2022-05-25,"I've been on the UX Design course since January 7th and have had an amazing experience so far. My tutor, mentor, and student advisors have been amazing resources to find encouragement, inspiration, and motivation to push myself to do more and get comfortable with being uncomfortable. Course materials are nicely paced and I don't feel like I'm overwhelmed with managing my time to accomplish them. Of course, there will be some weekends where I may need to dedicate a few extra hours but I figure that's part of the learning experience. I never feel like I'm left to my own devices and I feel that there are plenty of resources included with the course materials that dive deeper to let me get a better understanding on the topic. I look forward to finishing up and finding myself in the tech field! I trust CF in helping me find a job!",coursereport
676,Careerfoundry,2022-05-25,"My experience with CareerFoundry has been great so far! I am almost halfway through the UI Design Program.

This course has exceeded my expectations, and I look forward to where it takes me after completion.",coursereport
677,Careerfoundry,2022-05-25,The online UX Design courses at Career Foundry keep me engaged and curious.

The mentors and tutors are also extremely kind and provide you with well-written criticism to help you progress.,coursereport
678,Careerfoundry,2022-04-27,Definitely need a curriculum to follow in order to cover all that I would need before starting a career in full stack web development and CareerFoundry has done a great job in providing that.

680,Careerfoundry,2022-04-27,"Career Foundry has been a great experience so far. I really enjoy working with my tutor and meeting with my mentor. I feel like I’m learning a lot and doing a lot of good work to build my portfolio and skill set. I am doing the program part time and working full time as a Pre-K teacher. Completing the course on my own time has been very helpful, I really enjoy the flexibility.",coursereport

683,Careerfoundry,2022-04-27,"I have had a very positive experience so far with CareerFoundry. I started the FullStack program in February with almost zero coding experience. My CF tutor has consistently provided specific, meaningful feedback on each task; his responses are so quick, usually in a couple hours. I've also had a supportive and engaging mentor who has talked at length about his professional experience in additional to offering constructive insights about my bigger achievement projects. The curriculum is fast-paced for my experience level, but also includes everything I need to complete the exercises. The embedded videos are extra helpful for when I'm stuck. If I could make two changes, the first would be more opportunities to practice programming language syntax, but the instructors also share links for outside resources that meet this need. Second, the Slack community for peer support can be difficult to navigate. The CF staff do a lot to promote peer engagement, but I have to search a lot of Slack threads to find students who have posted about whichever task I need help completing; maybe a student discussion board linked to each relevant task would improve peer collaboration. I would recommend CareerFoundry based on my experience so far.",coursereport
684,Careerfoundry,2022-04-27,I choose Careerfoundry to start my UI journey because of the great ratings and reviews I read all over the internet and the possibility to get a voucher for this course from the Jobcenter. I was a little bit skeptical if this course would match my expectations but not only did it match them my expectations got surpassed. I am right now in the middle of this course and the way of learning is perfect for me. I really hope to increase my job chances but if they keep their promise I am optimistic that this was the perfect choice for me.,coursereport
685,Careerfoundry,2022-03-23,Great to have joined this course. It was just what I needed as a beginner. All concepts explained in a very simplified way and the best part is the Tutor and mentor who guide and review your work to further improve it as per industry requirements. Highly recommend this one.,coursereport
686,Careerfoundry,2022-03-23,"A self paced full stack web development program, it has been great for my busy schedule and I find the readings in depth and comprehensible. I feel confident and when i dont my tutor is always there to break things down for me.",coursereport

688,Careerfoundry,2022-03-10,"The UI Design program at CareerFoundry is organised in 6 different sections that help students to get skills on various aspects of visual design and user experience for app and websites. Students can count on the daily support of a tutor who reviews tasks during the week plus an extra feedback from a different advisor for broader projects.

689,Careerfoundry,2022-03-10,"The course content is great and very varied. Some of the instructions are not entirly clear however and can lead to confusion.

691,Careerfoundry,2022-02-17,"I started the UI Design program with CareerFoundry in December 2021, on track to finish by September (I'm doing a part-time track) and I'm loving my experience so far. I'm a nanny with a fine arts background, and really wanted a career change, but I wasn't sure which direction to go. I spoke with some friends with similar backgrounds and experiences who decided to go the tech route (some programmers, some UX designers) with either CF or similar bootcamps. They've since finished their programs and are in awesome jobs now- so I can definitely see myself in their position someday soon! CF's course material is packed with helpful info and tons of resources, and there's some basic UX material in the UI course. My mentor and tutor are both immensely supportive and communicative. I've also been seeking networking opportunities both within CF's Slack community and on my own, which has been a wonderful experience. If you're thinking about making a career shift and UI or UX design seems like something you could see yourself doing, sign up and take the Intro course! If you decide it isn't for you, you can get a full refund. They're one of the most affordable bootcamps, but the quality of their programs is amazing! Plus the job gaurentee also really eased my anxiety about making this jump. I'm working part-time and completing my program, which is difficult sometimes, but my only regret is that I didn't start sooner! I literally have nothing negative to say about my experience. It's a lot of work but if you're determined to learn, I highly recommend CareerFoundry and their wonderful and helpful team.",coursereport
692,Careerfoundry,2022-02-17,"I just finished the Intro to UX Design course and will be starting in the Immersive soon. I have really enjoyed the course so far and I’m excited to go even deeper in the immersive. My tutor and my mentor are both so engaged and excited about what they do that it’s hard to not feel excited every day to learn more. The student advisors are also great; very professional and kind, and overall the communication with everyone has been quick and easy. I researched a lot of other courses before deciding on CareerFoundry and was nervous to take the leap but I can say wholeheartedly that this decision was the right one for me and it’s going to change my life. I have no background in UX and I am still able to quickly understand the course curriculum. I will post another review when I graduate but I highly recommend CareerFoundry already.",coursereport
693,Careerfoundry,2022-02-17,"I'm really enjoying my UX program at CareerFoundry. the deciding factor was the tutor, mentor, and career coach support.

I enjoy the self paced learning style which still allows for helpful and quick feedback from tutors and mentors. I’d definitely recommend CareerFoundry,coursereport
695,Careerfoundry,2022-02-17,I’m enrolled in the UX design certification for the last 9 months. I have no design background and yet now I can say that I can design. The overall course content is very well organized and delivered. The tutor that I’m working with is amazing and super knowledgeable in his field. The mentor truly mentors. What else one can ask for. The course although is on a pricey end but with instalments it’s bearable. I’m rating 3 stars on job assistance because I’m unsure about it as haven’t been through that process yet. But it’s important to mention that I’ve been assigned a career counsellor now. Highly recommended,coursereport

I really enjoyed the course, the support (tutor, mentor, professional mentor, and colleagues) and I can say without a doubt that it's the best investment you can make. In only 2 months after my Bootcamp finished, I found the job I was looking for. It's a dream and it's everything thanks to these wonderful people that strive to help others achieve their dreams.",coursereport

698,Careerfoundry,2022-01-18,"I have been taking the UI Design course since Nov 2021. It only has been 3 months now but I’m learning tons about UI Design. Their curriculum totally makes sense to me and it comes in very smoothly to my head. My tutor and mentor are awesome people who give me pin point advices and suggestions. When I have any questions regarding my tooling issue, UX, UI, and career, they are the people come up to my mind first now and they are very reliable answering my questions. I am satisfied with this course so far and I can’t wait for more.",coursereport
699,Careerfoundry,2022-01-18,"My experience overall was great. I’ve learned so much not only about UX, but the industry as a whole and my potential career path as a new designer on 2022. Learning The Tools: Although my experience was smooth and progressed in a good linear fashion, I can see how it may be slightly different for some others. For context, I came into the program with some prior knowledge about the various tools used to create the fancy phone mock-ups and animations. For a completely new person, there might be a learning curve as CF doesn’t go too in-depth on how these programs can be used. Advice For New Students: Essentially what I’m getting at is that, you have to do research outside of what CF actually teaches. Be proactive in expanding your learning on top of each section. The good thing is they provide many links in each task to expand your knowledge. And I highly recommend you read each one. And on top of that watch CF’s YouTube videos. Course Critique For CF: I don’t have many but the main one has to be with the example project within the course “Fisherly”. It seemed very “half done”. Each example deliverable didn’t seem like it would pass in a real world situation. Maybe it was purposefully simplified to not overwhelm students. But In my opinion, I want to see a seasoned designer genuinely go through the process of making a project that they actually put on their portfolio. Just so that I understand what a well done case study actually looks like, instead of having to find my own examples online. Overall: Don’t be afraid of this review, the positives I have for this course heavily out way the critiques. In all honesty the community and support system within CF are top tier and can make your experience 10x better if you’re proactive.",coursereport
700,Careerfoundry,2022-01-18,"I recently started out the Data Analytics course with Careerfoundry. From the beginning until now[I'm in the middle of the course] I always felt well taken care of, either by my Student Advisors, my Tutor especially and my Mentor as well as other Students within the Community. I started with near to no knowledge about Dara Analysis and 3 month in the course im analysing Data in Excel, creating visualizations in Tableau and prepare presentations. Im overall happy about that I made the decision to go with Careerfoundry!",coursereport
701,Careerfoundry,2022-01-18,I think the CareerFoundry's UX course is great. The self-learning course content is highly relevant and the support from the Tutors and Mentors is very helpful in staying motivated. There is also a large student community so connecting with students with who'm you can collaborate with on tasks and ask general questions makes the learning experience more enjoyable.,coursereport
702,Careerfoundry,2022-01-18,Great experience!. I recommend CareerFoundry to anyone who is looking for a flexible schedule and a community of support. Many thanks for the help I received from my tutor and mentor.,coursereport
703,Careerfoundry,2022-01-18,"I was really hyped about the beginning, and it was amazing. I started first as a private student, but then I got Buildungsgutschein (if you are unemployed and live in Germany, check it out!) and started again, but I could resubmitted tasks that are done so far (which is cool). But I was assigned to another Tutor and Mentor. So the biggest advantage of CF is that it has 2 (later 3) persons that are in constant contact with you: your tutor, mentor and career specialist(that comes later, after you've done 51% of the course). I really really really love my mentor. She is so funny and full of great advices and I think we just flipped. She is telling me about the job preparation, what can I improve, what should I be relaxed about, what can I read/listen to/watch. Amazing person, who always makes my day! And tutor, who I'm in okay relationship. You have 6 achievements, which are divided into several tasks (7-11). They can require from 1-3h until 7-9h to be done. All in all, I like it because I am the one responsible for the time management, for how I'm gonna organize my day, studies, breaks. I really love that. And also, I've learn so much not only about UX but about myself too. The con can be that you are paired with a person that is not an inspiring one to you. But even that you can manage- either say it to Student Advisor (they are there to make everything flow easily) or change your point of view/ expectations. All in all, I would recommended! For sure.",coursereport
704,Careerfoundry,2022-01-18,"I am halfway into the course and loving the experience so far!

Was also looking for a longer Bootcamp (no 2/3 months) so CareerFoundry was the perfect match :) I would recommend it!",coursereport
705,Careerfoundry,2021-12-20,"The course was great! I learned so much. The help from my tutor and mentor was invaluable, as well as the career / job preparation coaching.

The program is flexible, so you can work whatever hours you want at whatever pace you want, which is the big draw for me.

708,Careerfoundry,2021-11-03,"I am super happy I was able to take the UX Immersive course with a Bildungsgutschein from the german jobcenter. During the course you work on two portfolio projects, one is short to get an overview about the process and one is more detailed. This helped me a lot to practice UX methods and get confident with different software. You get assigned to a Tutor and a Mentor who help with tasks, software and provide support when you get stuck. There is also a Career spezialist to prepare for the job application phase and a slack community to reach out for various questions. I would highly recommend school!",coursereport
709,Careerfoundry,2021-11-03,"CareerFoundry has been an engaging and fun experience. The content is highly relevant and easy to do self-directed. I appreciate the examples of student work they include which help me understand if I'm on the right path. In addition, every task is working towards something that could be in a portfolio but broken up into small chunks so that it is not overwhelming and helps keep you motivated to keep working. The tutors and mentor have been amazing! They respond to my questions quickly and give detailed feedback. I recommend CareerFoundry to anyone due to the support, curriculum, and the fact that is all comes at an affordable price that is hard to beat.",coursereport
710,Careerfoundry,2021-10-26,"I started the CareerFoundry program in January 2021 and completed the main UX Design course in July 2021. I completed the remaining courses (specialisation - UI for UX Designers & Job Preparation) in September and October 2021. I don't normally write reviews, but I feel like I have to write a review for CareerFoundry. My experience with this course has been nothing but positive. I started the program because I wanted to execute a career change, and after conducting an extensive amount of research on online courses, I decided to proceed with CareerFoundry. I chose them because of 2 reasons: 1) They focus more on your portfolio rather than the certification (as I have some experience within the creative industry, I know that employers are only interested in what you can bring to the table in terms of creativity, rather than your qualifications). 2) They have a job guarantee (I thought that they must be sure of themselves if they can give you your money back if you don't get a job within 6 months of completing the course). CareerFoundry has helped me discover my new passion for UX design and have helped me land my first ever full-time creative position as a Junior UX/UI Designer. After completing the entire course on 12 October 2021, I landed my new job on 26 October 2021. CareerFoundry has helped me develop a brand new skill set, successfully market myself as a job seeker/career changer, and has given me the tools necessary to create an industry-standard portfolio. The curriculum is up to date, easy to understand, and structured beautifully. It's so easy to follow and psychologically challenges you to go above and beyond on your task submissions by featuring your work to other students (if your work is a great example). I'd say the only suggestion/criticism I have for them is to show more video demonstrations, as there is a lot of reading to do. This might benefit students who have a low attention span and find it difficult to read long paragraphs at a time. Other than that, the course is amazing. I also really like how it presents a timeline of your progress and what you can do to stay on track. The mentors, tutors, student advisors, and career specialists are incredibly helpful and are there for you every step of the way. I am more of an independent student and I don't like asking for help much. I also didn't feel like I needed a lot of help either, as the exercises and tasks were so easy to understand. The only time I would ask for help is when I needed my mentor to review my portfolio, just so it was up to industry standards. All in all, CareerFoundry is an incredible online course and it's no wonder why they are one of the leaders in UX Design online education. I would recommend the UX Design course to anyone who has a creative foundation, high level of empathy, willingness to learn, wants to change careers, and has persistence and drive. I cannot thank CareerFoundry enough for what they have helped me achieve. Best wishes, Alix",coursereport

This was one of the best decisions of my life as I’m learning something I love and getting great feedback and support along the way. Everyone at Career Foundry is super supportive and I would recommend 100% choosing a course with them. If you have the chance to invest on yourself and your education, this is a great place to be, and you can do it at your own pace , which is great too!",coursereport
712,Careerfoundry,2021-10-18,The school curriculum is great. They have a great way of teaching and building your portfolio at the same time. My only complaint is that there are a lot of designer tools you need to master and they don’t really teach you how to use them.,coursereport

714,Careerfoundry,2021-10-18,"From the onboarding, I have to say that everything made sense, and they sent you material before and were able to sign up to learn more about each specific study field. I studied five months prior, but I had no structure and low confidence levels when I taught. It would be tough to pull this off, especially with no help or direction in my portfolio. I think CareerFoundry has an excellent structure for self-paced learners who thrive on being self-accountable and dependable. Because you are in an online cohort and not in person, it is super important to build that relationship with your tutor/tutors. I had Bryce and Vijit, and they always give good feedback and send links to relevant material. Besides that, my mentor Oz is very personable and has a remarkable ability to break down problems or questions for me, and his video feedback is priceless. Lastly, I have just recently started working with my Career Specialist Cheron, and she is excellent and has an insightful view on why I want to pursue specific opportunities. I would say you get what you put into the program.",coursereport

The course does an amazing job of keeping students engaged and I enjoy the way the information and different concepts are presented. I do wish that Figma was presented in the course since it is used a lot out in the field, but maybe this is something students will have to learn on their own as I did.",coursereport

The concept of their course is very useful as I was able to work on a real world project that I can add to my portfolio. Instead of having just a certification to showcase to potential clients, I also have a project with all my deliverables that can better explain my thought process within the UX/UI field in addition.

721,Careerfoundry,2021-09-24,"Definitely recommend. For anyone in a tech role, you're always going to be updating your skills. You can never learn enough or have enough practice. But my course with CF gave me the skill set and confidence necessary to learn on my own, without a college degree. I feel very prepared for the junior data analyst role and for a lifelong career. The skills you learn also match up almost exactly to the job descriptions of junior analyst job postings, with some data science curriculum as a plus.",coursereport
722,Careerfoundry,2021-09-15,"I absolutely LOVED my time studying UX Design with CareerFoundry and honestly it was so much better than I had hoped! I had brilliant mentors and tutors to guide me and I received great feedback throughout, I really doubt I could have excelled this much without all this feedback! The course does its best to prepare you for work afterwards and does a good job considering it is fully online. The course is broken down into manageable chunks and you learn not only core principles and techniques of UX Design, but also bits of UI Design and even a small amount about speaking with developers and how to code! I chose the UI Speciality which i'm super happy about because I finished the course with 3 portfolio pieces! My incredible career specialist Neha helped me; prepare my resume and LinkedIn, create a great cover letter and practice interview techniques. The only thing I would say is this course is no joke, it can be intense at times and even though I took it on a part-time basis, I ended spending about 25 hours a week, worth it though! After finishing my course less than a month ago I have found a full-time UX/UI Designer role, something I could have only dreamed about before all of this. 100% recommend to anyone, it's definitely worth the money!",coursereport

724,Careerfoundry,2021-09-09,"Everything here is to get you from knowing nothing to start a career. Great pace, no worries if you are late on summiting your homework, but this is not for slackers. The course do a great job of giving you everything for you to succeed, specially with the job guarantee program. Only negative is that they don't teach you how to use the softwares you will be using on the job (Adobe XD, Sketch, Figma, etc) rather they guide you to use such tools but it's up to you to learn them at your own pace. I give them a pass just because softwares tend to be outdated with the years.",coursereport
725,Careerfoundry,2021-09-09,"I have had the best experience with Career Foundry so far. I’m a French teacher and have no prior experience with coding, but I’m thrilled with everything I’ve been able to do so far. The curriculum is clear and easy to follow. My tutor and mentor are great and always helpful whenever I have questions or get confused. I haven’t yet gotten to the job search part but I feel very supported and encouraged. I’m so glad I took the plunge and signed up.",coursereport
726,Careerfoundry,2021-09-02,"I think if you are new to the UX design field, need flexible time to learn, you must choose CareerFoundry because its course is very well structured. It consists of an intro UX course, a UX Immersive course, and a specialization course. After learning, you will be proud of yourself can do the UX design. Also, they have a great team to support you. You do not feel alone even though this is online learning.",coursereport
727,Careerfoundry,2021-08-25,"I'm taking the full UX course which includes an intro course, an Immersion course and a specialization course. I love how much they focus on the design process and drilling it in. I also love that you come out with multiple projects for your portfolio. Some more things I love: Lots of mentorship Video calls with mentors Lots of freedom to design your own way Constructive criticism Things I Don't love: It can be hard to talk to student services if you have a problem with a mentor or tutor. They only communicate via email and it can be hard to explain your whole situation and be understood. But they are doing their best to help The first project is only up to the first wireframes. So you need to take extra time to make it portfolio ready I feel they lack some extra resources they do provide some with the instruction but I find myself having to find my own resources for extra learning as theirs aren't always helpful or relevant. Overall, the course is a good bang for your buck and I'd reccomend it.",coursereport

730,Careerfoundry,2021-07-28,"I recently completed my UX design course with Careerfoundry (Get a 5% discount) and, I would like to share the answer to the 5 critical questions that I was looking for before I enrolled in the course. DO YOU NEED A BACKGROUND IN DESIGN TO DO THIS COURSE? IS THIS COURSE WORTH SUCH INVESTMENT OF MONEY? HOW IS THE COURSE IN PRACTICE? HOW’S THE MENTOR AND TUTOR SUPPORTING YOU? WHAT IS THE REAL ADVANTAGE OF DOING A COURSE WITH A JOB GUARANTEE? DO YOU NEED A BACKGROUND IN DESIGN TO DO THIS COURSE Before enrolling in the UX design course with Careerfoundry I was able to complete a bachelor’s degree in Digital media, so I had a good foundation in design. However, I agree with Careerfoundry when they state on their website that you don’t need to have any background in design to do this course as they will teach you all the process from the beginning. The first part of the course is a very introductory project to allow you to get the foundation on UX design. What I, personally, feel is required is, generally, a good knowledge of using the computer and software, even if they are not design related. You will need to be ready to learn all the software that you will need to use during this course on your own. Yes, you can ask for help or support from your tutor and mentor, but learning software is all about practicing by yourself. The good thing is that in most cases, once you become confident with a part of this software, all the rest will get easier to learn. What I feel is more important than a background in design, to complete this course successfully, is to have strong motivation, and the willpower to keep going when you may feel frustrated on some task or won’t feel confident about your knowledge and skills. IS THIS COURSE WORTH SUCH INVESTMENT OF MONEY? Many people have been asking me why I did not do a free or much cheaper online course. I probably could do it, and I believe that it is possible to start a successful career in UX design also with that type of course. However, I felt that the advantage of having a mentor and a tutor to support me, the warranty of an updated and quality proved curriculum, and the job warranty, have been fundamental in giving me the awareness that I was working in the right direction and, therefore, to keep me motivated until the end of my course. The fear that the course I would be doing may not have been enough to get in the UX job market, alongside the feeling that I could have wasted my time studying a course without many warranties, would most likely have stopped me in the process. HOW IS THE COURSE IN PRACTICE? The three different parts of the course are divided into achievements, where each achievement includes an average of 10 tasks to be completed. The fundamental course includes just one achievement, the immersion 6 achievements, and the UI specializations 2 achievements. Each task is estimated to require an average of 4/5 hours in total to be completed, but a few of them need more time. Each task usually consists of an initial reading that generally requires from 30 to 50 minutes. In support of each reading, you typically receive plenty of additional suggested resources if you wish to get deeper into the topic. After the reading, you have a straightforward quiz that needs to be done. Usually, it requires less than 5 minutes. Finally, you have to do your task for the topic. This can be anything from doing some user research, wireframing, or some exercise to help you understand the fundamentals of UX design. You will also get access to see three of the best tasks submitted by other students as an example, so you will have a more precise understanding of what is required to do in that specific task. Most of the tasks you will be doing will be part of the final project that you will include in your portfolio. Overall, you complete at least one different project for each of these phases. At the end you will come up with at least 3 projects on your final portfolio, which is what matters at the end when it is time to apply for jobs. HOW’S THE MENTOR AND TUTOR SUPPORTING YOU? The tutors are usually UX/UI designers with at least a couple of years of experience in the field, while the mentors are typically senior UX designers with plenty of experience. The tutor is the one who will approve all of your tasks and will be ready to assist you in any problem you may face while working on your assignments. This will be done through chat only, where they are usually replying to all of your questions in a few hours.With the mentor, however, the interactions are through video-chat. You have unlimited calls with the mentor, but I don’t think you will need more than once per week. I found myself also going through the course for two or three weeks without needing any call. The mentor will be the one that will approve the final task of each achievement and the one that should help you to orientate in the world of the UX design industry, sharing tips and advice for being successful in this field. Other than the tutor and mentor, I found the Slack community created by Careerfoundry to be another great source of support. That is the ideal place to get connected with other students that perhaps are working on the same tasks as you. It is very helpful, especially when you may need feedback or collaborations with other people to complete the tasks. WHAT IS THE REAL ADVANTAGE OF DOING A COURSE WITH A JOB GUARANTEE? I admit that the job guarantee was one of the main reasons that convinced me to choose the Ux design course with Careerfoundry. This is because it gave me the feeling that I would always have a final winning situation in the end, with either ending up having a job or having done the course for free. Besides being an effective and powerful marketing strategy from the schools, I think the job guarantee is also a great advantage for students who want to enrol in this type of course with the final goal to land a new job. However, from my personal experience, I feel the real purpose and advantage of doing a course with the job guarantee are to give to the students the confidence they are working in the right direction following a solid method that will provide them with the right skills and knowledge to get started to work in the field. Overall this gives a strong motivation and focuses on working till the end of the course. In conclusion, I would suggest students to consider the job guarantee more as a guarantee of the quality of the course, more than a way to have an exit strategy in case they won’t find a job. Pros Job warranty Support from great tutor and mentor Easy to connect with other students on Slack community Final portfolio with 3 projects Flexibility to study part-time or full time Cons Expensive Studying from home can feel alienating and lonely sometimes. You may get a refund from the job warranty but still not have a job If you think you want to study with Careerfoundry click here to get a 5% discount to any of their courses.",coursereport
731,Careerfoundry,2021-07-26,I am currently in the UX Design Program at Career Foundry and I am very impressed with the program so far. I had never done UX before the program and I have learned so much since I started in December. The lessons are clear and well written and I have the best tutor and mentor to help me if I have any questions. Plus the courses are remote and can be taken from anywhere. I would highly recommend Career Foundry to anyone looking to learn new job skills!,coursereport
732,Careerfoundry,2021-07-26,I have really been enjoying taking the ui course with career flu dart. My mentor has been very helpful with tips and useful information for the real world. Both my mentors give me great feedback to improve my work. I do wish the online course had more videos for references and other useful tips. I’m a visual learning and I think more videos would be helpful,coursereport
733,Careerfoundry,2021-07-15,"Choosing between different online bootcamps was a difficult process because there are so many, but I'm so beyond happy I went with my gut and chose CareerFoundry's UI Design Program. The curriculum is very well thought out and allows you to build upon your skills along the way, so many resources are given to you so you can really go above and beyond what is required. I also love how flexible the program is, its self paced so you can move as fast as you want through the material and can take days off when needed. The tutors and mentors I've worked with (and really everyone I've met at CareerFoundry) are so unbelievably helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. They really are there to support and help you and are willing to give you additional time and resources because they are so passionate about the space. I can't say enough great things about CareerFoundry!",coursereport
734,Careerfoundry,2021-07-14,"So far I have learned a lot with the courses, but I must admit that it was a very short start and I often feel bored with the assignments. Some of the tasks are tedious and too simple and feel more like busy work than learning anything new. Of course it's understandable since people are at all different skill levels when they start, but the school would benefit maybe a little from being more flexible depending on previous knowledge of the student. Also, the school seems to concentrate only on XD/Sketch, but I think it would be useful for students to learn a little bit of other design software, such as Illustrator or InDesign. Also, the majority of the learning process is reading long texts. They recently added a function in which there is audio of the text, but since they used computer AI instead of a real person reading it, there are many many mistakes in the audio. I think, the program would really benefit from switching to a video format. Especially since so much of what we are learning is visual.",coursereport
735,Careerfoundry,2021-07-14,"I’m currently passed half way of my course and I’m enjoying every bit of it! I’m a product manager so UI/UX isn’t new to me, but I still learn so much from the course so far. The tutor call feature is super helpful, and it doesn’t have a limit on how many calls I can do. Can’t wait to give another update once I finished the course and see how the job placement goes!",coursereport
736,Careerfoundry,2021-07-14,"I'm currently just over halfway through my UX Design course. The course is nicely structured and great if you are self-driven. The most amazing part of the course for me is having access to my mentor, tutor and career specialist, that's where the value of the course is. I really recommend the course for the structure! You're able to have creative freedom with your course project, I really like how I can try something different",coursereport
737,Careerfoundry,2021-07-14,Career Foundry has been a great and challenging experience. They have really great team. I have a tutor and a mentor.

She was extremely knowledgeable and helpful in providing guidance during my job hunting process - from resume building, optimizing my LinkedIn profile, to salary negotiations. I appreciated and trusted Neha’s background as a recruiter to get the roles that I wanted within a short period of time. My success story would not have happened if it were not the full support of all my design tutors, mentors, and career specialists at CareerFoundry.

The course material is okay but I found the one to one mentorship most beneficial. I think it's worth the price and time, and if flexibility is what you are looking for, look no further. It took me almost a year to finish my course(because of full-time childcare responsibility and my freelance work) and this kind of structured course is perfect for someone with other commitments. I worked with Neha Hurpaul(my career specialist) and together with updated my resume and she guided me throughout the Job Preparation process. I interviewed with 18 different companies and I got my first job as a Product Designer after 3 months of job hunt. If you have self-discipline and determination, I would say go for it!

Offers options to have the chapters read to you as you go along, for me that is a bonus and I take in info much better that way. Highly recommend!

743,Careerfoundry,2021-07-01,"Hello, my name is Szilard and I’m currently on the 1/3rd of the Full Stack Web Development program! Before I started the course I did a little research and found out that the CareerFoundry has the best offer in terms of time and curriculum. This is my first online course so I don’t have any references. My opinion is that the course material is the best you can get in this period of time, I mean 5-6 months, because I am learning full time. The support you have from the CF team is blameless, no matter what kind of problem do you have there is always someone to help! *At the end of the course I’ll come back and edit this review, I’ll write about the job preparation course too!",coursereport
744,Careerfoundry,2021-07-01,"Having just finished this course I have to say that as a beginner the course was paced nicely and the information was there, with many references to go even further and get more information. The examples from other students was a nice help, but sometimes these examples were blank, whether this was due to the example being removed and not put in I have no idea. The course as well was very much geared towards using Sketch with only a little assistance for using Adobe XD and nothing at all for Figma which did make things a little harder for me as I do not have a MAC. The mentors and tutors have been excellent, answering questions, giving pointers and forcing me to find the answers with hints and questioning. All in all I would recommend this course to anyone.",coursereport
745,Careerfoundry,2021-07-01,"I have been in this course for almost three months now, it has been truly an amazing experience. I love the self paced aspect of this course. Additionally my mentor is very helpful and resourceful!",coursereport
746,Careerfoundry,2021-06-24,"I'm almost done with my web dev program, and I have enjoyed my time as a student at CF. Some of the highlights include how understanding and helpful they were when I had some personal issues that made studying full time difficult. They were very supportive and offered me help along the way. You are also assigned both a tutor and a mentor, both of which will review your material and help you out with almost anything. I have gotten so much out of my interactions with these two, and I feel like this is a keystone in the CF student experience. I haven't finished the course and made full use of the job assistance program, but it looks really good. I am currently doing the job prep where we are putting together our job profile, optimizing job materials, etc. But it sure has helped me out more than any previous ""Resume writing 101"" course I have attended. This is much more extensive and helps you out in a more tangible way. I don't have any strong issues with the program. Yes, I have stumbled across some parts of the curriculum that were poorly explained or outdated, but the CF staff make an effort to try and update their curriculum continuously. And I don't think that the perfect curriculum exists as you have to learn how to synthesize multiple sources of information as a web dev throughout your career anyway. My tutor has been a great help but I have experienced being stuck on problems and waiting on help for days at a time. This hasn't been too common, but it has happened nonetheless. As opposed to a physical boot camp where you have an instructor at hand to ask direct, pressing questions, I can't count the number of times I have sat for 24 hours waiting on responses to various questions. This is maybe the only really frustrating part of the course, as the response time for requests can end up taking a lot of your time. Also, in terms of studying remote, you as a student have to make an effort to network and find a study buddy on their slack channel in order to not grow disconnected. This is not CF's fault as this is simply a default for anything remote, and they do make an effort to encourage us to be more interactive, etc. Just be aware of this. Overall, I'm glad that I did it, and CF was a great fit for me since it allowed me to be flexible with my own schedule as opposed to being sat in a classroom from X am to Y pm Monday to Friday. And the course price was a GREAT value deal!",coursereport
747,Careerfoundry,2021-06-18,"I found an article on LinkedIn that addressed Graphic Designers on how to learn UI/UX. I think it may have actually been a CareerFoundry article! I decided to look into it and wanted to learn more. I was feeling like I wasn't going anywhere in my career and the industry in which I worked was starting to decline (Newspaper). I ultimately chose CareerFoundry as my bootcamp to learn these new skills and I'm very happy that I did. The curriculum is wonderful. You are first given a quick intro to the course and you learn how to use the tools and some basic fundamentals. Most of the software you'll need is either free or discounted (since you can use your CF invoice to prove you're a student) The mentors and tutors I had were excellent. Quick response time and very resourceful and insightful. You'll learn a lot of the fundamentals, skills and more advanced stuff as well. The course gives you what you need to understand how to take the reigns and learn other things on your own once you're graduated. Also you get a career mentor (if you choose to do job prep) and mine is incredible! Made a lifelong friend. She was always encouraging and helped me out tremendously. I was able to get a job 3 weeks after graduating. That was applying to at least 5-12 jobs a week. I think you have a better chance if you already had some design experience. Either way I'm very happy that I've learned better and more modern skills to help me grow my career.",coursereport
748,Careerfoundry,2021-06-15,"I have a design background with graphic and web experience and I was looking to get back into the work force with new skill sets. I did a lot of research for bootcamps but this one seemed to have a very comprehensive program. I also looked on the website and saw that one of the graduates had exactly the same background as I did (Fine Arts/Digital Arts) and so I looked her up and emailed her directly about the program. Her email was so encouraging. She took the time to respond to all my questions but everything she said felt honest as she throughly praised this program saying it was the best decision for her and her family. I signed up and found out she is a Tutor! So I asked to have her for my Tutor and now still staying connected through her consulting business! Now looking back I had no regrets whatsoever with CareerFoundry (except maybe not being able to do it full time because the community is amazing and I did not participate as much as I would've liked). However, the program is geared towards anyone and everyone who is serious about switching gears to become a UX Designer. I was surprised to find that a LOT of folks are mid-career looking for a change. Now that I am in the work force, I realize 1) How enormous and wide this speciality really is and how it truly embraces so many different kinds of skill sets - ""Researcher, Designer, Developer, Engineer, Coordinator etc"" and 2) How this job description works for literally ANY industry out there - everyone and anyone can use these skills sets and finally 3) everyone IS looking for these skills sets! They are realizing how critical these skills sets are and how valuable. I absolutely LOVE my job now. I never really connected fully with graphic design or just with web design. I'm also a professional artist so I have a lot of problem-solving skills that I intuitively wanted to utilize in a job environment - I had no idea that this job is setup perfectly for someone like me. This job is highly collaborative though - I have understood that you must work with a lot of different kinds of people understanding not just your user's insights but your stakeholders too etc. During the program, all the tutors and mentors were EXCELLENT. They had so much experience and so willing to share them, and I still feel confident I could call them up (which I have done so recently) to ask real-world questions from them etc. They have all been so generous with their knowledge etc. Where else could I find those real connections? I could have participated a LOT more with the community but you have that option as well. Their community is thriving with all sorts of CareerFoundry staff members ready to help as well as newbies to the program that could easily make new friends, etc. and it's amazing because we're all over the world. I really appreciate that viewpoint too because being headquartered in Berlin just gives more of a richness/diversity to the program as an American. The course was very logically setup with enough instruction with enough pace, not overwhelming but organized enough to keep me interested and pushing through it. But all of it is based on ""tasks"" to get things done and in the end goal is to ""produce something,"" for your portfolio and that is worth the entire program. And to be honest that's only way that I learn so I was able to actually complete it. But ALL the skills that I learned, I am using daily in my current job. I got hired as a UX/UI Design Lead for a software company that works with DOD projects here in the US. My 90+ person team is developing an Air Mobility Program for the 618th AOC here at Scott Air Force Base. I am the only UX Designer supporting 8 software development teams, working in Agile/Scrum environment, etc. And because ""UX"" is relatively a new industry, my co-workers actually don't know what a UX/UI Designer really is or what they do and how they can help shape and contribute to the entire vision of the product for their users etc. I came into the role finding out my predecessor was not a ""designer"" actually but probably was a gifted UX ""researcher."" However, that did not setup the program very well and so I'm now in the process of reorienting these teams to provide a cohesive, integrated application from the design perspective, adhering too UX design standards, etc. for the entire program! It's a lot of work but I am loving it. Truly so much potential! And just getting started! Absolutely have already recommended this program and want to become a Tutor myself to support this exciting and fast-paced growing community. Finally excited to do my work everyday! Thank you CareerFoundry!",coursereport
749,Careerfoundry,2021-06-15,I had decided to go with CareerFoundry because it's comprehensive and super flexible. You will get a tutor who reviews your assignments and a mentor who reviews assignments at the end of every achievement. It's a self paced course so you can make your own schedule. A lot of study material with videos will be provided and you can book calls with your mentor whenever required. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to start learning UX design.,coursereport
750,Careerfoundry,2021-06-12,"The lessons, coursework, and projects are great! And the fact that I get a tutor and a mentor has been very beneficial as in past bootcamps I only had a mentor and it might take him 2 or 3 days to approve an assignment or get back to me with an answer to a question. My tutor always gets back to me very quickly with advice or approvals or helpful answers. My only concern is that neither tutor or mentor are too heavily involved in my projects, and they often times forget or don't know details about my project that I thought they would have known.",coursereport

After long comparisons, I decided to choose CF. It's super flexible and it's self-paced. It's based on self-study. They have course content you read, some chapters have videos, there's links to external articles. You get a tutor and a mentor. Tutor reviews your assignments and mentor reviews the assignments at the end of each achievement for a portfolio review. Why did I choose bootcamp when I could have saved money? The fact that I get a curriculum to keep me on track makes it worth the money. I love how self-paced it is. I started in February and my graduation date is December but I'm more than half way through and will be on track to finish a couple months before December. So far, I have no regrets!

752,Careerfoundry,2021-06-11,"The whole enrolment process took 6 months. That should have been the first red flag but I was excited so I ignored it. The level of mentorship/tutorship is way bellow the expectations. You'll have to almost beg them to look into your stuff and it always feels rushed and careless. See, the tutors and mentors have a real 9-5 job, and CareerFoundry probably pays them pennies so naturally you will be at the bottom of their priority list. If you are thinking you'll have someone explaining everything to you and will go through your code with you, let me break it to you but it's not gonna happen. You'll be completely by your own for the most part. In fact whenever my tutor answers to one of my questions, he asks me if I ""googled it already"" and then send me a stack overflow entry he got from a quick search. The curriculum itself is alright. Think of it as a compilation of the free resources online. Definitely not worth that much money for the material alone. I think you are better off learning on YouTube and Google by yourself. It's easier to follow and free. My general feeling is that the course is way too expensive for what it is. Unless you have prior experience or don't need any mentorship whatsoever, then I'd NOT recommend this course to anyone. Specially if you are paying from your own pocket.",coursereport

I had some previous experience in the field of software development and I was looking for something to boost my knowledge and I think that it was the right decision to start a course with them. The CareerFoundry curriculum is very well organised and complete. When you are studying on your own there is a lot of information out there and you usually feel overwhelmed and don't know how or where to start. In this school they have a complete program from the very basis that is going to guide you to succeed your goals as a web developer. Also your Mentor and Tutor as well as the student advisors are always there for you to answer any question you may have.

754,Careerfoundry,2021-06-02,"I started my course in Jan 2021 and 6 months in, I can say that I have learned a lot! My favourite things about the course: - The curriculum is well defined and structured. Each topic is explained clearly, with context and examples. When using tools, you will have a tutorial to follow on the side - Tutor + Mentor feature is helping me progress and understand more than what it’s explained in the course. Moreover, I get repeated feedback, support and help with whatever hurdles I come across - Resources and examples: each chapter has a task you have to submit. You always have a breakdown of things you need to include in your assignment plus examples of successful tasks. This helps a lot if you don’t know where to start from or tend to overthink stuff. Improvement points: - This is purely subjective, put some parts of the course would be more helpful if they had video explainers next to them",coursereport

It's great to be using the course content and putting what I've learned into practice all the time with the course project. It goes from one steady step to the next and allows me to feel that it is a continuous process building from one lesson to the next.

The best part of the program is the access you get to professional mentors and your career mentor. I found the career mentor to be especially helpful as I began my job search. Five months after starting the program, I landed a senior UX design role. I believe that recently graduating with an MBA played a big part here, but I also couldn't have done it without the portfolio that I built in the CF program. CF is a good program for people who are highly motivated to put in work, inside and outside of the classroom, to make their dreams a reality.",coursereport
757,Careerfoundry,2021-05-27,"Honestly, this course deserves full marks in every category. I was skeptical at first, but once I started on my first day and was able to interact with others, check the curriculum and even jump into the course - I loved it. You are supported every step of the way and the tutor, mentors and specialist genuinely help you and go overboard to make sure you are confident and ready for the professional life. I would 100% recommend it (and actually have been since I started haha) Benefits: - It's a community, I was able to connect with people from all over the world that instantly click with me because we are all going through the same career change phase. -Community help, that means any questions, bumps, even emotional breakdowns you may have.. are instantly met with answers, and support. I was able to ask awkward questions in regards to salary and how to deal with recruiters by so many individuals with similar experiences... -The course is so detailed, and so informative that I felt very prepared in my interviews and was even asked once by a senior design how did I learn all this in less than a year.. - the mentors.. That alone should be in a category on its own. They are amazing. I was blessed in every course with amazing mentors that responded so quickly to any question I have. Some even went beyond and would schedule emergency calls with me if I needed help before an interview (even on their family day!) and they really made it a point that my success is not graduating - it's finding a job I like and maintaining it. Their goal is your future success. Cons: - I wish there were more social events in which they would help us meet up if we're in the same city. There are some groups that do that but mainly students organized it themselves. But this is very minor and more of an added value.",coursereport
758,Careerfoundry,2021-05-20,"I started the UX Design course in as I need a career change when COVID hit. As with starting anything new, there is always this uncertainty-factor; Will this really be something for me? Will I be able to commit to studying again for 6 months? etc... What I really liked was Careerfoundry's free short introduction course where you get an email every day for a week with a brief introduction on the some of the UX & Design principles and some ideas on what the daily life of a UX professional looks like. This definitely helped me in making the final decision to choose UX Design. Now the courses itself are well thought out and put together in a logical way. I had a great tutor guiding me along the way and who was available to me whenever I had questions about a certain topic. In every lesson we got familiar with a new concept, workflow, design process and at the end of each lesson, a task given to immediately put this new knowledge to test. I really like this practical, hands-on and project based way of studying. At the end of every chapter (Achievement), your mentor, a UX professional with years of experience, gives feedback on your results from said chapter. I firmly believe that the guidance and support of both my tutor and mentor have played a crucial role in finishing the UX Design course. Additionaly, you are also added to CF's Slack community, a great place to talk about anything design and even more importantly, give and get feedback to fellow students! At the end of the course, you have a solid understanding of the design thinking process and all steps that come with it, you will feel comfortable using design software such as Balsamiq, Sketch, Figma, XD, etc.... and most importantly, you will have created a beautiful portfolio piece about the project you decided to design. There's also a Job Preparation course which becomes available to you upon 50% completion of the course. As a career changer or when you're looking to get your first job with little to no experience in the professional world of design, this is a great support to prepare you for job interviews, map out your career and career preferences and polish your portfolio. If you've got a problem-solving attitude and you can deal with getting all kinds of feedback (this is somewaht at the heart of every design process!), I can highly recommend CareerFoundry's UX Design course!",coursereport
759,Careerfoundry,2021-05-20,"I am really impressed and extremely satisfied with CareerFoundry's UI Design Program. My course was divided into 6 Achievements with an average of 9 exercises per module, and from the start I could already notice that I would be learning real and relevant skills. The course is planned in a way that each exercise gives you a theory lesson plus a task to practice the theory you've just learned. This gives the student a sense of moving up and evolving throughout the course and also to really feel that they're understanding what is being taught. I was also glad to see that all the subjects and content are up-to-date and there's a lot of external material for the students to consult to better inform themselves about the concepts that are being explained. Plus, they're system of learning and working on tasks makes the students feel more confident as the course progresses, and the resulting portfolio feels like an accomplishment the student can be proud of. I also have high praises for both my mentor, my tutor and my career specialist. All of them helped me better understand the concepts and the tasks, gave me relevant and motivational feedback and helped me feel more confident by the end of the program. Last but not least: CareerFoundry's Slack Community was the cherry on top of the cake. I've met several other students and alumni there, expanded my network, was able to exchange precious knowledge and took part in several webinars with valuable industry insights.",coursereport

I will say that the initial sets of assessments were very basic and a little bit frustrating to have to go through as I did not feel they taught me anything. In the end though, it is a good course.

From support and understanding with organising payments, the tutors and mentors for this course, I have so many options in terms of asking for help and clarification, I have access to students also undergoing the same course, they remind me of things I forget that are important for my study journey, career advice, the whole 9 yards.

I went from a non-design background to landing a full-time digital product designer internship within 6 months. My mentor experience was incredible and I am grateful for the feedback, encouragement and industry trips I received from both my tutor and mentor. I chose the course partly because of the self-paced approach. You truly get out of it what you put into it. My biggest tip: Make friends with fellow students via the active Slack group and LinkedIn! I've met incredible people within the design community and CF changed my pandemic year...for the better. Also, remember that this program is just a launching point and it'll take networking, volunteering, side projects and hard work to go the extra mile in the job search.",coursereport
769,Careerfoundry,2021-04-21,"I am currently a student at Careerfoundry and it's one of the best decisions I've made. I did a career change from Interior Architecture to UX Design. I was nervous but excited to start my journey in tech. I researched so many bootcamps, but I chose Careerfoundry. Careerfoundry provides a comprehensive curriculum: Intro to UX, UX immersion, Job Preparation, and a Specialization course. The course takes 10 months to complete, yet people manage to complete the course in 6 months. But if you're a beginner, I encourage you to take your time and grow, as there's so much new and indispensable information. You will get a Mentor, Tutor & Job Prep Mentor - The team is helpful, you'll get lots of support and guidance. You also have a whole cohort with other students who will be on an exciting journey with you. So, get well acquainted and exchange UX tips. I chose CF over other schools due to the price, support, and job guarantee. When looking for a Bootcamp, aim for those with a job guarantee. The tech industry is competitive and getting a tuition refund - if you don't land a job in 6 months is paramount. ""Popular"" boot camps will charge you over £10K and not even guarantee you job security (You know who...) - Don't fall for it. One thing I will say about this course is effort and determination matter. On this course, GIVE IT ALL YOU'VE GOT. The journey is not easy, and there will be times when you will get frustrated. Be prepared and realistic. But this is a part of the process, it will be rewarding when you graduate and become successful. Like all things worth having, it takes hard work. So, get out there and make your mark. Good luck.",coursereport

It’s platform is well done, it encourages you to keep going, by splitting the course into manageable bits. The job preparation course is what really makes the course stand out for me, in the end you want a job, and just some nice portfolio case studies most likely doesn’t get you the job you want. The profile prep, interview prep and guide on the job journey is totally worth the money. And on top of that, you have a personal tutor and a mentor for your coursework. self study needs dedication and self discipline, if you have that I think you would be well matched with CF.",coursereport

Even though it's online, which can be difficult at times as there is a huge learning curve, they have created an uplifting and supportive community (on Slack) where everybody wants to see everybody win. I've connected with different students all over the world and been partnered up with a mentor (one of the reasons I enrolled in CF) who answers any questions I may have about the industry and helps me with my projects. I definitely like the flexibility I have with this program (I work part-time) and I like how they take you through the process of UX design work where you actually learn while you're working on a project. The material itself is easy to read always followed up with a task to practice what you learned. UX design is cool work, very meticulous though. So if you have patience, a keen eye for detail and persistence, then this would be a good fit for you. Good luck!",coursereport
776,Careerfoundry,2021-03-30,"I had heard about CareerFoundry and it always seemed like a promising path to take; but at the time I did not have the financial or time resources to sign up. After a few years, CF was still in the back of my mind and during the pandemic I decided to finally take the leap. Although I admit that the first month had some bumps (mentor had not shown up to the scheduled call..(two times in a row) for example), I decided to keep on going and hoped that my faith would be restored in the program. I am glad that I stuck it out because I am now writing this review after having my very first UX interview scheduled later this week. I truly believe CareerFoundry does its absolute best in order to be as relevant as possible in the fast-moving design/tech industry and this is reflected by the course material. The program structure was perfect for me because although it was a CHALLENGE to keep the morale and quality work up, the end result is extraordinary. You have a polished portfolio ready to show-off to future employers and you have a community of over 10K individuals around the world who you can discuss and share this new adventure of career-changing. The model of having real people interactions as your support system throughout the journey was what made it possible I think to achieve this milestone. The material you learn is curated in an enjoyable way and the tasks are applicable to real-world scenarios. I now feel confident that I can tackle whatever problem comes my way. The only advice I would offer (which I am sure the team is already aware of) is improving the technical material on the software side for interaction design (Figma.Sketch etc). I was lucky to have tutors & mentors that truly loved what they were doing and wanted to see their students succeed. I'm excited for my new career! Thanks CareerFoundry! (**Advice to incoming students (especially working students!): set aside time for physical and mental breaks, take care of yourself first, try to interact with the community on Slack and build new long-lasting relationships, don't take shortcuts, each deliverable you submit is a piece to your final portfolio!) I went with the UX Design Program with a UI specialization. This specialization was definitely the right choice for me, if you feel like you need a bit more hands-on practice with visual design (typography, visual hierarchy, color theory) this is for you! I was very weak in this area coming from an analytical research background, so this helped me polish my knowledge and technical ability. If you are on the fence about the decision (like I was!), I'm open to answer any questions you might have for peace of mind/positive support! Feel free to connect and send me a message on Linkedin! :) Happy learning!",coursereport

Even though, I am not a particularly good online-only learner, I made it through the course. It is all about getting into a routine and setting a manageable goal on how many submissions you want to do within one week. A total of roughly 80 submissions sounds a lot at first but it helps you break the pile of content into small chunks and it gives you the feeling of achieving something 80 times :) And what amazed me the most is the progress I am seeing comparing submissions from different points in time.

779,Careerfoundry,2021-03-17,"Overall I am extremely happy with choosing CareerFoundry. I enrolled in the UX Bootcamp in September 2020, and it took me a while to get used to taking an online course. Not easy to sit down and study on your own, right? What I liked about CareerFoundry was having a tutor and mentor to talk to. This was a huge asset for a distracted person like me. So, the first thing I did was that I started booking weekly video calls with my mentor to get a sense of how it is to be a UX designer. As a result, I got more engaged with the curriculum and finished my first project by October and got my Intro to UX certificate. The UX design program in CareerFoundry includes three sections: · Intro to UX: you design an app from scratch with an overview of the user research, wireframing and prototyping· Immersion: you will get a chance to design another app from scratch. This time you learn much more details· Specialization: you will choose your specialization from existing courses and move further to become a professional UX designer In addition to this, once you have passed half of the program, the job preparation course will be unlocked for you (if you are eligible for the course). In the job preparation course, you get a chance to work on your resume, cover letter, LinkedIn profile and creating your elevator pitch. You will have a professional career coach for this course too. Moreover, you will be connected to other students and your peers in Slack. You can find a study buddy, get feedback on your project, get help from others, help them on their project, and share your thoughts and concerns for job applications later on. To sum it up, I felt very supported by CareeFoundry. It was like they were taking me step by step toward my new career by teaching me all the tips for being successful in finding my first job as a UX designer.

Even though the Team replies to emails very quickly, it happened once or twice that after exchanging a couple of emails my question remained unanswered (or the answer was not clear enough). I believe that if I had a chance to explain my issues in a call, my problems would be resolved. Some group tasks involving CF students would be great. Before signing up for the course I really hoped to have some actual ""classmates"", which would be motivating and just help to network. More video tutorials or diagrams/illustrations? More visual content would help a lot - not everything's clear just by reading a text. Slack-based student community. It is great, but as CF moves such a basic thing as students' community to a platform of CF's choice (Slack), it would be nice if they also provided a premium for the CF students. That's all that comes to my mind!",coursereport

Apart from excellent content of the course that is broken into small achievable goals, prompt input from tutor, regular guidance from mentor helps. The student advisors and onlife CF community makes sure that you do not get into your shell. CF, from time to time keeps a check on the pace at which you are learning and generously tweaks your timeline too.

I was learning web development on my own before I decided to enroll, but now that I've made it near the end of the program, I know that there is no ways I would have made it to the level I am at now on my own. Their mentoring and feedback have been great and it is that human interaction that made me want to join their program. I have a tutor and mentor for web development as well as a mentor for career-preparation and they all have been incredibly helpful and have gone beyond what my expectations. With much information on the internet I knew that I could learn anything I wanted for free. The problem with that is it's difficult to know what information is worth learning and spending your time on. CareerFoundry's curriculum and mentoring have really kept me on the right path and I feel that I have learned much more efficiently than I would have if I was still trying to do this on my own. Compared to other bootcamps I researched, I felt that CareerFoundry had the best value and I really liked that they emphasized the mentoring and feedback because those have been most important to me.

That includes a Slack community, tutor, mentor, and student advisors. Along the way it has been hard at times, but the layout of the course is easy to follow. It let's you know what pace you are at and gives you some freedom. It consists of reading a chapter and doing a project at the end. So you will be learning a lot of hands on skills. My mentor and tutor have been outstanding and role models. Cameron and Jayneil, thank you so much for your hard work. It is up to the student to schedule calls and follow up if they need help. So you need to be some what of a self starter. I usually am a lazy guy and I was able to do it. So don't give up. It took a long time to pick a boot camp but I am glad I chose Careerfoundry. The website was the first one I found when randomly researching UX bootcamps. The price was right in the middle and it influenced my decision greatly. Luckily they did a good job at selling the program. I have yet to do my specialization program at the end of the Immersion course, but I know it will be a good experience.

I feel extremely happy studying with CareerFoundry. I read the course with joy as it's written in a very understandable, simple and even fun way. Are you a TOTAL beginner like me? then this is just the perfect guidance, really. I feel I have been learning so much and really build a great portfolio that I can't wait to share when I start applying for jobs. Another thing I find great is the Community at CareerFoundry with other UI/UX, Web development, Data Analyst and more students, currently studying or already graduated. We can give and receive feedback on our work, which is absolutely great and sooo valuable! In these times in 2020 it's more difficult to go places and be very social spending time with others, but since I am doing this course, I gained two study buddies that became my co-work buddies and great friends at the same time. We learn from eachother, network and have a breakfast, dinner or a good cup of coffee together as well. Once again, I feel in great hands at CareerFoundry and I would love to help others and recommend who want to change their career or expand their knowledge in one of these fields.",coursereport
798,Careerfoundry,2020-12-07,"""Designer"" title is already an attractive word for your CV hangs down. That means that you may be able to help in making a difference. But if you want to move from being desirable to be required all you need is to enrich the communication with the whole team, and that means the development team too. I am about to finish my course with Career Foundry (CF)and I couldn´t be happier with the decision I made by choosing it. Now that I have met the bowels of development is not that I will be expert building things by my own but I am ready to take to next level any product with my team as I know how far we can go. Talking the same language is way far important. Even though I have been able to create my own portfolio from scratch, I have learnt HTML, CSS, an introduction of JS and much more things I didn´t expect to learn but CF is really professional covering whole skills of the student and they know how important soft skills are in the professional field. I can say they don´t miss any detail. I would either add I feel quite lucky having the tutor I have, it is really important you connect well with your tutor so they can push you to go further and CF ensure you have such a connection to double-check you are taking the most of your programme.",coursereport
799,Careerfoundry,2020-12-05,"More than worth having done the course. A very good overview of all topics and with the practical relevance - excellent. Tutor and mentor have always helped very well. I never thought that the online would work so well. Since I haven't been looking for a job for so long, I can't say too much here yet. But maybe it won't be that easy in times of Corona. But overall never regret having taken the course and aiming for a job change.",coursereport
800,Careerfoundry,2020-12-05,"Prior joining Career Foundry (CF), I thought I don't need such a course to enter tech industry. With my 10 years experience, I thought my knowledge, skills, professionalism would be enough to switch from Brand Designer to UI/UX. But, after hitting the rejected by more than 100 different tech companies, I decided to join CF. That stage alone wasn't easy because there are so many online/offline course for UI/UX Design Program. During the program you will have your own Tutor and Mentor where they will monitoring, giving you insights and feedback to support and make sure your work is meeting industry standard. I know for some of you and including myself at first, ""giving an emotional support, positive thoughts and blablabla, it's such a cliche notion that nobody affected and leading to toxic positivity"". But, believe me, I'm a skeptical, bitter and self-driven person turns out really appreciate the emotional support that I didn't believe I would need such a support from all of them. The staff even sending email to me and making sure how I'm with the progress. One thing maybe that could improve is the payment format for the tuition fee. For some of us, 3,5K euros could be hard to pay, maybe there is an option to have an installment format that we could monthly pay, but it's just an idea. I'm pretty sure the back office have thorough discussion about this. Anyway, I guess that is all from me, I know it's a long review, it's just showing how I'm fully satisfied with the program and thanks to them, my mindset and skills are expanding and now I got a job because of CF team and the career specialist that keep pushing me. Shout out to Jan, George, Rafi and other CF staff!",coursereport

I was thinking about getting into UX Design by completing a Bootcamp for a couple of months prior to COVID-19 hitting. Once everything shut down, I thought it was the perfect time to start working on my career change. This course is 100% online and super flexible. I highly recommend CareerFoundry to anyone who asks. I've already learned a ton about UX throughout the program and I'm excited to continue to learn. You'll have access to a tutor and mentor to help you through, which is such a good perk for me so I can get professional feedback on my project.",coursereport
803,Careerfoundry,2020-11-04,"I will start off by saying that I was skeptical of deciding to enroll in CareerFoundry’s UX Design program. I did a ton of research online about whether or not to take a Bootcamp-style course that could potentially change my career. Let me just say, I am SO glad I decided to take that leap and enroll! Within the past few months, I have gained an incredible amount of knowledge regarding everything UX (and then some!). Every Exercise has been so thorough, yet easy to understand. But what I value most is the guidance I have been receiving. Student Advisors are always so quick to help with any technical problems, and my Tutor gives me great constructive feedback on my assignments. Most of all, I am very grateful for my Mentor. She’s critical, but in a good way. She pushes me to be the very best I can in order to succeed in this competitive industry. Plus, she has given me so much advice on job searching, interviewing, portfolio creation, and networking. Overall, if you’re thinking about changing your career to UX Design or gaining new skills, I would highly recommend CareerFoundry.

First I was sceptic about how applicable the content would be and how professional my Tutors and Mentors will be, but after the first week, there were no doubts left. I am an established designer already and it worked perfectly for me. I received great professional support and the challenges were both perfect for beginners but also for established professionals. I would do it again!",coursereport
805,Careerfoundry,2020-10-28,I took the UI Course with CF as I wanted to get into this field. While I had some prior knowledge in graphic design (from learning in private) I wouldn't say I had an advantage. The course was demanding but so well structured and guided that I had no trouble at all. The only thing about the curriculum that I would improve is the guidance in regard to the portfolio. I personally had no problems with it because I have some skills from before that came in handy here but I know I would have been a bit lost if I wouldn't have had these. What I especially loved were the connection to the tutor and mentor which helped immensely.,coursereport
806,Careerfoundry,2020-10-14,"I don't have any prior knowledge about HTML, CSS or JavaScript. I am a UI design graduate from CareerFoundry back in 2018. I had a very positive experience with CareerFoundry that is why I chose to take this course with them to gain an understanding of Frontend dev. skills. The course is for 2 months with access to 1 mentor that supports and guides you through the whole process. The course is well structured, has many examples and resources. It provides the basics and you end up with creating a portfolio-website from scratch using the above skills. The content is well written in a simple language that is clear to everyone. One thing I would have liked to see is an active Slack community. Currently, there isn't one but you have the support of your mentor if you get stuck with anything. I hope they can build a community where the students can share their thoughts, issues and also recruit participants for user testing purposes. I fully recommend CareerFoundry for your next learning venture.",coursereport
807,Careerfoundry,2020-10-08,"I'm just over half way through the UI design program and can highly recommend it if you're looking to get into UI design as a career change. There's a lot of support from your tutors, mentors, career specialists and course advisors! Throughout the course you have a chance to build up a portfolio while developing your skills, which was a really important factor when deciding which school to go with.",coursereport

In each task I feel that I learn many things and that I am slowly building my career. They always give us extra material to read. My mentor is also very kind and our conversations are always enriching. I also started the work course, the teacher seemed very nice and ""down to earth/ with the feets on the ground"". I definitely recommend this course. Before starting it, I had read the comments of the people here, so now I am happy to leave one myself.",coursereport
809,Careerfoundry,2020-10-01,"Less than a year, I was looking for a new opportunity to change my job for months. I was disappointed about all those years that I did design projects and wasn't satisfied with what I had as a job. I'm over 30 and a ""very conservative person"" to make new decisions and change things in my life. The first time that a friend suggested me to look for UX courses, I started exploring and ask some friends in Toronto, New York and Berlin to give me a suggestion, where to study and what to do. That was impressive that none of them knew each other, but all suggested to start with CareerFoundry. I booked three calls and asked many questions. After the second call, they even recorded a video and explained all my questions in it. That time I felt the big difference in how they care about people. One of the excellent options was I could pay in ten months, and that wasn't that much pressure for me. Still, I wasn't sure if I can finish it and was worried if I drop this course like several times that I dropped my design university courses. I said to my student advisors, tutor and mentor about my most significant problem, ""lack of self-confidence"". And I could improve this feeling in the first month, and I resigned my job to focus/ practise more on what I learn. That was impressive that usually during a day for several times, I asked many questions from my tutor (Moritz Oesterlau from Germany) and he answered all of them one by one or corrected my assignments with examples, different online sources, videos, etc. For several times he even created a video while reviewing my project to show how should I do the task. Beside Moritz, I also had a fabulous mentor (Piet Alberts from South Africa) that helped a lot and showed me how to invest my time in the right way to have a professional result. It was awesome that all students could book 100 times their mentor for an hour video call. I had to study 15 hours a week, but day by day, I feel greater about how I learn and have this much progress; After a while, I spent 10-12 a day to study, reading UX books or watching tutorials. My third mentor (Marion Sénéchal from Switzerland) joined the team in the middle of course. Job guarantee wasn't only a word to get more students. I almost made ""all the materials"" for my CV, Linkedin and website from zero. (during all these times, I had great supports from three student advisors who asked me every week if I feel good or bad about course. The last point I want to mention is after you finish all courses (job course too), every two weeks you have a video call with your job mentor and explained what you could do for getting job offers for six months. During this time if you get an interview before your next appointment, you contact the school, and they ""immediately"" book a special time for you (with your mentor or if it's not possible, with another mentor) and you work on the essential skills that are needed during the interview. As a conservative person that is 30+, I highly recommend CareerFoundry to change your life and have your ""new career"", not ""a job"".",coursereport
810,Careerfoundry,2020-09-25,"Hours of instruction: 853. That is a lot of time devoted singularly to one course of study. For me, pretty much every day over the last 6 months. One can't say it was just a superficial look into the world of UX. Though, from my studies, it's clear it is just the tip of the iceberg. I feel that the Career Foundry course and the exercises we were required to do have given me a good, real world foundation into the world of UX Design. An online course requires a large degree of self discipline (something I admittedly struggle with) but I was able to work through it and fall into a rhythm that helped me get through. The information provided seemed up to date and relevant to the real world and constant contact with my tutor and mentor (both current professionals) helped reinforce that. I found both of them to be top notch, always giving me precise feedback and suggestions on how I can improve my work. The student advisors were always helpful and provided quick responses (within 24 hours) to any organizational questions I had. Their Slack student community was also a plus, providing peer review, anecdotes and support when things got tough. It's also a great source of networking. Negatives? I suppose the online format can be a challenge as there is no instructor on a zoom call, for example. Lots of reading and tasks to perform every day. It can be a lot to juggle. I found the Career Foundry website and the messaging a bit wonky. Ironically hard to navigate and the tutors/mentors didn't always get our messages. I'll see once I start working in my new field if it was enough to get a foot in the door. Did I learn anything? I'd say so. I only knew this subject matter peripherally through my current job. It will be up to me to practice what I've learned through self-directed challenge so I can really absorb and internalize it. I would recommend this program as it is well organized and logically put together. Each exercise builds off of the knowledge you'd learned before and concepts are repeated so that you don't forget. Only time will tell if it is enough for me to transition into this new career.",coursereport

CareerFoundry course helped me to find myself and my passion, also the course curriculum is fully rich, appropriately comprehensive, and self-paced, and supported with an abundance of resources for every step along the way which helped me to build my skills and guiding me to work in a career which I really love. CareerFoundry community is a great supportive place with a positive and encouraging learning philosophy, during the course you will be surrounded by a well trained and professional team including mentors, tutors, student advisors, and the whole team who work to help you step by step to reach a professional level and prepare you for the job, also there is a welcoming community on Slack where it's easy to reach out and connect with other students. As a previous student and a UX tutor now at CareerFoundry, I extremely believe the UX course with CareerFoundry is the right choice for you and your future and will help you to find your passion.

812,Careerfoundry,2020-09-13,"Back in November of 2019, I realized that my current profession is not for me. So I started doing a research on how to use my base education divert to more exciting profession. After much research and countless phone conversations with bootcamps. I decided to proceed with CF. The course is structured as the following: 1. Intro to UX where you learn to create a sketch prototype. This also acts as the stepping stone for the next section. 2. UX Design immersion. This is where you learn the meat of UX Design, from lo-fi to final polished product design 3. Cherry on top where you get to specialize in one of the following: Voice Design, Web Development & UI Design We have a tutor, mentor and career advisor. 1. Tutor: Works with you to ensure that your assignments are in line with product development. Sometimes, I wish the mentors could be little tough on the students to nudge them more. I prefer someone little bit tough to get more out of me, but that's just my personal preference. 2. Mentor: This is where I talk to my mentor about my product and walk through my rationale on why I choose certain design decisions. I'd highly suggest getting in regular contact with your mentors to showcase your progress. They usually have suggestions and/or questions. 3. Career Advisor: I haven't had much exposure with him as I'm still trying to finish the course. Because of what I learned so far, I feel like I've made the best decision. I learned many new concepts and how to tinker with ideas to create an exciting product. In addition to the supports given to you by CF, you also have to be motivated to make the career transition and learn something new. I cannot judge how other bootcamps are structured. But I've learned a lot from CF and ready to use my knowledge to venture out to a different career path.",coursereport
813,Careerfoundry,2020-09-08,"I want to leave my review for the ""Introduction to Frontend Development course"" , which is part of the Full-Stack Web Development Program. My experience so far has been awesome. What I enjoy about CareerFoundry is the fact that it's fully flexible, so you can manage your own time. I also appreciate the help I received from my tutor and mentor, who were able to give me insight into bad coding practices, industry knowledge, as well as helping me when I wasn't able to proceed on my own. Although the program is remote, there is a community of students who I can connect with on the Student Slack Channel, where there are not only web development specific task-help channels, but also career advisors, who always give you helpful tips. I recommend CareerFoundry to anyone who is looking for a flexible schedule and a community of support :)",coursereport

I love the mentorship and guidance that CareerFoundry provides. I am glad that they started offering an intro course so that students can decide whether or not they are interested before continuing on to the full immersion courses. Based on my experience in the intro course, I am deciding to continue on to the immersion course as I feel it will be well worth it.",coursereport
815,Careerfoundry,2020-08-22,"After doing plenty of research around the various bootcamps (and deciding that giving up my job wasn't an option) I went for the CareerFoundry Full Stack Web Development Course. My main reasons for choosing the course were: It was remote and self-paced - This meant I could work it around my full time job. The reviews I could find of the Web Development course were good. The price made it an affordable option (at the time it was £2500 although I believe this has now increased). The material focused on JavaScript and a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack which is a up-to-date approach. You are given a tutor and mentor throughout the course who both work in tech, you also get a career coach when you complete the course. The Job Guarantee was transparent. Many bootcamps offer a 'job guarantee' but the CareerFoundry one felt like it was written to reassure students of the effectiveness of the course rather than providing so many hoops to jump through no-one would ever qualify for a refund! The Learning Platform & Content As the course if fully remote you complete your bootcamp using CareerFoundry's online platform. This platform is easy to use and shows you goals (such as how many sections you need to complete each week). The majority of the lessons are text-based and are laid out really well, each one has a step-by-step task at the end and these seem to get less prescribed as time goes on requiring you to put some of your new skills to good use and learn all about problem solving too. Typically your tutor marks most your work and provides feedback and a pass/needs more work and your mentor marks the final project of each section...you also have Skype calls throughout with your mentor too. The content as a whole is excellent and I found that I learnt a lot, there's also lots of 'if you'd like to learn more follow this...' links which enable you to go deeper. For me, the pace was spot-on and other than the Redux section which completely confused me I found the whole thing was explained and presented really well. The great thing about having a tutor is that when you get stuck you can reach out to them. The Extras The Full Stack Web Development course also offers some extras beyond the material of the course itself. Mentor/Tutor - Both of these people are there to help you and already work in the industry. I ended up changing mentors halfway through but both were really good. My only piece of feedback for CareerFoundry would be that some more guidance for both students and mentors around what these calls should entail would be really helpful for making the most of them. Slack - CareerFoundry offer a Slack community for students past and present. I found that I didn't really use this as the majority of the discussions were around the UX/UI courses rather than Web Development but they were nice to have. Career Course - Halfway through your main course you gain access to the career course. This course talks you through things like telling your story as a career changer, helps you write a CV and cover letter, shares good places to apply for jobs, helps you create a good LinkedIn profile and offers some interview advice. As part of this course you have a mentor who offers feedback on your submissions and can tailor their advice when you start applying for roles. My career mentor was excellent and I certainly owe some of my success coming out the course to him. Summary Overall I would certainly recommend the CareerFoundry Full Stack Web Development course. The communication from CareerFoundry was great, the course content was really good and they constantly related the content and principals into the workplace which made you feel like you were preparing to put your coding into practice as you went along. I also felt like they didn't try and spoon-feed you everything but helped build your confidence in reading documentation, Googling and learning new things (skills that have really helped me as I've continued my learning after the course).",coursereport

Also there is a welcoming community on Slack where it's easy to reach out to the school, career counsellors, and other students for help.

825,Careerfoundry,2020-05-07,"The UX Design Program is an intensive, and concept heavy course, with lots of helpful information for anyone wanting an introduction to the UX methodology. I'd suggest having some basic graphic and graphic software knowledge before you decide to apply for the course to be able to finish your tasks in the estimated time, especially if English is not your first language. There's a lot of reading, research, writing, and you'll need to learn using software or graphic language mostly all by yourself. I don't think this is necessarily bad, it's a normal studying process, but it can be stressful to meet the deadlines while having to do some extra research on the side. Overall, the course meets my level of satisfaction, and the whole experience with CareerFoundry is a positive journey.",coursereport
826,Careerfoundry,2020-05-06,"This type of online bootcamp is really dependent on how great your mentors/tutors are, and I was lucky that my mentors were super hands-on and were not hesitant to give me constructive criticism. The courses itself had some issues with flow and lessons not matching the assignments (at least for front-end dev specialization), but I am aware that they had just recently changed the lesson.

I started my studies in June 2019 and I am super satisfied with my decision. The articles are clear and easy to understand with extra resources about the topic. The tutor who is assigned is helpful and ready to answer all of the questions I have. Their advisor team is super nice and they even check up on me regularly about how I am feeling with the course. The physical distance does not affect the quality of the studies as there is a great communication flow between the students and teachers and we even have a huge slack community. I had one bad experience with one teacher but everything was sorted out nicely, and feedback is always welcome. The goals are reachable even beside a full time job, and you can ask for more time if you are sick, or having a holiday. I had a small graphic design background but believe me you do not need any. You just need some imagination and creativity but you won't be lost if you dont have any design background. I did not even finish the whole course, but I already got promoted within my company just because the portfolio I made and because of the knowledge I received from Careerfoundry.

Hiring managers, CTO, Co-Founder - KNOWS BETTER. 😊 Let go if something takes too long and let Universe do work for you! 🥳 There were 2 companies, which contacted me super fast with hiring managers interview phone calls, which went very well but the process of recruiting was slow (big companies). There was also a positive outcome by networking event open for me but due to the present situation was put on hold. In mid-time a very high level of professionalism recruiter found me on LinkedIn, call me immediately with an email with descriptions. All process took 7 working days from phone call to confirmed career offer with my weekend away in mid-time (4 days, why not to take a break from it 😎). Altogether from finishing the Job Preparation course, it took less than 3 weeks in a career search after graduation at a very easy, relaxed phase. I could start earlier but I needed to finish some projects and get into New Chapter, New Begining, go shopping etc 🙂. I and my boss established a date of start together on mutual agreement, New Moon, 24th of March as we both are into those type of stuff, which is even cooler. 😁 I also suggested or more even required to hire Junior Developer as part of the Dublin team. The great guy was chosen who click with us, similar mindset and interests count so much and we all started at New Moon.

830,Careerfoundry,2020-03-05,"I am so thankful for CareerFoundry. The UX Design Certification online gave me flexibility to keep working and the interaction with my mentor (a Senior Designer 7+ years of UX industry experience) was invaluable. The curriculum is extremely thorough and well designed. Additionally, I had a great experience with the job prep course and the Career Specialists. Sami and Jennifer were an amazing source of support! Everyone I interacted with at CareerFoundry was helpful. They have a great staff as well as amazing tutors and mentors. I enjoyed interacting with other students and alumni through slack and have made friends through the course as well. My advice: be prepared to put in the work and then additional work after you complete the course. Networking is essential. Be open to feedback and apply it. Use all the CareerFoundry resources to your advantage while you are in the course (and after). UX Design is very hard field to break into but the CareerFoundry program gave me the design training, resources and job preparation/career advice to get an awesome entry level UX job (far better than I imagined was possible for me). CareerFoundry is worth the investment. It changed my life and I am so thankful and excited about my new career!!!",coursereport
831,Careerfoundry,2020-02-26,My experience with career foundry has been great! One reason I decided to take the UX design course with them is because of the good communication and extra help from mentors. There's also a strong sense of community.,coursereport
832,Careerfoundry,2020-02-21,"The course was informative and helpful overall. I did find it overpriced for what it is, and expected a more in-depth learning experience. A big downside to me was not having any idea about how other students were doing and therefore not being able to ‘chart’ my learning in comparison to peers. Likewise, the tutor’s feedback on my work had no score so I never really found out how good I was doing and how much better it could be. Each tutor has their own opinions as well, so obviously to get tasks approved it has to meet their standards or expectations, and not necessarily those which are universal. Coming from no background in design though, I did learn a lot. Of course, further research is required if you want to learn in more depth. Lesson tasks are not repeated (you do it once and are expected to learn it) and there doesn’t seem to be much of a flow between one lesson and the next. The last two achievements of the Immersion course felt random and didn’t connect to each other properly, and the lessons themselves weren’t thorough. I felt like some lessons in the Immersion course were wasted on irrelevant content, some could have been more properly explained, and others could have been combined to one lesson instead of two or three. Each exercise does show three examples of other students’ work for that lesson, which is a good guide if you didn’t really understand firsthand what is expected. Starting my first job soon, I don’t feel confident enough in my knowledge, especially since I won’t be working within a UX team but rather alone and am going to have to figure a lot out for myself. It was hard for me to find friends or students to keep in touch with from the slack channels, because everyone seems to keep to themselves and has not much interest in maintaining friendships or acquaintances. The slack career channels are a bit discouraging and all the channels in general are heavily monitored by the school admin, which in my opinion discourages communication between students. Of course, doing the course was useful to me. I finished it 3 weeks earlier than planned, and also got a job within two and a half weeks after graduating which is a very short time. I also got a big jump in salary from what I was earning in my previous line of work. The field is much more competitive and hard to get into than is first advertised by the school though, which comes as a big shock when you are knee deep in the course versus when you begin and have a lot of high hopes. The course does what it says but beware. A lot of the job postings are looking for people with a background in tech, design or psychology. None of which I have! They also take preference with those who have some kind of degree in those areas. It’s a highly competitive field and finding a job is no easy task.",coursereport

The curriculum is great, they cover a lot of ground and it is truly an immersive experience. It can get easy to get side tracked, so make sure you figure out a schedule as there are no due dates for course work but there is a time period which they expect you to complete the course in.

838,Careerfoundry,2019-10-21,"I have finished the UX Immersion course and want to share with you about the experience. I have only heard about UX design about a year ago, by accident. When I started the course I was totally clueless about design, technology or business. I guess I just needed to learn something new as even if my work was very rewarding I was feeling kind of stuck and without growing a lot. Anyway, I am so happy I enrolled for the course. It was difficult I must say, I was always googling new words and everything was so new and hard to integrate with my previous knowledge, probably because I had no previous knowledge on the subject. However, the course has a great structure, offers basic information but also links to more advanced knowledge if you want to dig deeper. The tasks are also very much hands-on - which is the best way of learning - through doing. My tutor and mentor were incredibly supportive along the way and sort of feeling sad upon completion that there is not going to be a weekly email exchange for too long now. I will miss it. The slack community is also so great and diverse. People from all over the world and from different work backgrounds discuss there so openly and friendly. Even alumni still hang around to offer support and guidance to current students or just participate in conversations - I really liked that. I think CF very much has a ""family"" feeling. The only thing I have struggled with was to respect the timeframes they advised. It always took me longer, maybe twice or three times longer if not even more. However, don't say I've said it, but I even got 2 free months extension to help me finish the curse in time. ;) Shhh...! (I don't really know how this works but it was great for me as a young mum on a support worker's wage) Please get in touch if you want to know any more details. I will be happy to share. You can find me on Twitter @andreea_nesu . Best to all!",coursereport
839,Careerfoundry,2019-10-17,"I started the UX design course in May. So far I have been enjoying the course very much. It is well structured and students can learn UX design from scratch, no knowledge is needed before starting the course. I would like to write down some pros and cons. - Pros The course is very flexible. Students can do this course either part-time or full-time. I think it is a great advantage for people who are students or have jobs. As I am a student and have a part-time job, I do this course part-time. Usually, I just submit two tasks per week and I am supposed to finish this course by the end of January. My tutor is very dedicated and responds pretty quickly. Every time I submit my assignment, my tutor will decide to approve this or not and gives me detailed comments. I found this system very helpful. The course structure is well thought and very practical. Students are supposed to design a web app for a portfolio. I am enjoying this process and found this very useful to find a job. - Cons The first half of this course seems to be too general. The course is for people who never learned anything about UX. So, for me, the beginning of this was too theoretical and not so interesting. It was a bit shame that I could not touch design tools until the middle of this course. I don't know how to interact with my mentor and it is difficult to change a mentor. Aside from a tutor, students are paired with a mentor, who is supposed to support a student. But I don't know what to consult with my mentor as all I need to do is to proceed with the course...Also, although I wanted to change my mentor, it was not easy because all mentors and tutors are paired, so if you want to change a mentor, you need to change a tutor too.",coursereport
840,Careerfoundry,2019-10-17,"I'm just over half way through the UX Design course and I am thoroughly enjoying my experience.

CareerFoundry did a great job of pairing me with a tutor and mentor that work well for me and keep me motivated and on track. The coursework is a lot but I'm learning so much - and the course is flexible enough that I'm set to graduate ahead of schedule!",coursereport
841,Careerfoundry,2019-10-16,"I am currently halfway through the UX Designer program, and it's been very intense, and sometimes a little hard, but after each assignment in the Achievements, I feel like I'm building upon my knowledge. Then when I finish a whole Achievement, I'm shocked when I'm pulling together my portfolio for that Achievement by what I've accomplished. I am just starting the Job Preparation course and that's been quite an eye opener in regards to learning how to organize my time with goals, create strategies for motivation, and even ways to stay positive while going through this career change. And that's above and beyond building my portfolio, writing my resume, learning how to articulate how to interview for UX Design positions with confidence, and even target employers and apply for positions I'm interested in. My Tutor has been amazing at guiding me through each Achievement. Sometimes, I need to make corrections to an assignment, whether it's missing something or just needs tweaking. I'm given a clear direction on what I need to do. In the same regards with assignments that come back approved, she still gives me resources to further my knowledge. I have only spoke with my Mentor once online, but she reviews my portfolio that I build at the end of each Achievement, and gives me amazing feedback. My Job Prep Career Specialist is guiding me through the whole process to prepare myself for this new career. I'm looking forward to working with her for mock interviews and having her teach me how to interview to GET that job I want. I look forward to applying my user-centered approach, creativity and detail-oriented work ethic to make digital products easier and more intuitive to use, and I have CareerFoundry to thank for this. If you're looking into a career change, whether it's UX Design, UI Design, or Web Development, I can tell you with great confidence, you can't go wrong going through this program with Career Foundry!",coursereport
842,Careerfoundry,2019-09-17,I really enjoyed the course and the material. I thought it the UI course was very well structured giving you a good understanding of how everything is connected. The course also includes your basic UX as you will always come across that. I did the course fulltime in 4 months which is a good amount of time but it is still a tightly run ship. I worked as a designer beforehand so it was not all new stuff but I believe some prior experience is very helpful for the UI course. Something that is also very helpful is the online community which you stay part of afterwards. So there are plenty possibilities to ask questions or get support which is a lifesaver when changing jobs.,coursereport
843,Careerfoundry,2019-09-16,I'm the kind of person that needs structure and deadlines to get my self into gear.

845,Careerfoundry,2019-09-12,"AtI'm currently enrolled in the UI Design course at CareerFoundry, and I'm almost halfway through. So far, it's been a very positive experience. Student advisors, tutors, mentors and fellow students respect each other and are very supportive and helpful. The lessons are interesting and suitable for people with or without previous knowledge or experience in, for example, graphic design. Instructions for tasks are clear and there is a step by step increase of complexity as the course continues. Fast feedback from my tutor and mentor lets me work on the course at my very own pace. There is only one real deadline, and that's the 6 month mark. By then, you have to be finished with every task and achievement. If you fail to do so, you can buy an extension to get more time. So it's really all about discipline and keeping yourself motivated. At first, it looks like quite an investment. And it sure is! I thought about starting the course for a few weeks, before I finally made the decision to go for it. You invest in your future and skill set, so in contrast to going shopping and satisfying materialistic needs, you don't immediately get something in return. You'll have to be patient and willing to learn, and then, I'm sure, it'll pay off when you start a new and exciting career.",coursereport

A lot of additional links are offered for more in depth reading and you'll have access to your course even when it finished, so it's always possible to come back and reread stuff.

I was also pleased to see that there was a short section about design strategy, I understand this itself is a whole lesson but it was good to have an introduction to this. I noticed I did not use the right side menu options with mail, and help that much later on in the lesson, but asked all my help through Slack community, I would rather have quick access or an index to other lessons there. Thank you to my tutor Thea who shared a lot of extra links with every assignment and my mentor Javier with all his knowledge and examples of real-life work and Emir for helping me to prepare for a job his knowledge and help was more than helpful.

851,Careerfoundry,2019-08-18,"Only one month after finishing the UI Design course, I landed a job as a Junior UX/UI Designer in Berlin. Having crossed paths with CareerFoundry (CF) was the best decision in my Professional Career. I have a background in Communication and Media Design. For two years I worked designing graphics for museum exhibitions. However, I was always curious about UI. A friend of mine was taking the UX course and he recommended me to talk with a CF Agent, to discuss my possibilities since I was unemployed and they offer collaboration with the Federal Employment Agency. From the first phone call, I immediately felt connected and welcomed. The information provided about the course was completely transparent and clear, so I enrolled for the in the full-time UI Design course. I was somehow resilient about studying online since I like to be around people and it demanded the same time as a regular job. Nevertheless, the support and advice from my tutor, my mentor, and the CF team, made me feel always accompanied. I was also fortunate to attend events at the headquarters in Berlin to network with other students. However, there is an active CF Slack community and no matter where you are, you can always connect and seek advice. The contents and exercises are very well structured. The approach of creating portfolio-ready projects helped considerably for the job search. Even if I had already design training, I believe that anyone can follow and learn fast. One month before finishing the UI Design course, I started with the Job Prep course, which I truly believe is the key to finding a job. My mentor gave extremely useful advice to improve my Portfolio, my Resume and prepare for interviews. I consider that my experience in Communication Design helped considerably to land my current job as a Junior UX/UI Designer. Although at CF I learned the tools and practices for the current demands in the tech world environment. I extremely recommend enrolling in the course and discovering a new world of possibilities!",coursereport
852,Careerfoundry,2019-08-15,"Overall the experience was fine. In the beginning I felt really positively about it — as someone with no design background, I wanted a fair amount of hand-holding, and my tutor was wonderful, very responsive and helpful. But towards the end I grew frustrated with what I perceived as lessons written by CF as being somewhat ""phoned in"" — I spent the vast majority of the time searching the internet for answers that should have been expanded upon in the course. Another major point of frustration for me was the estimates for time it would take to complete the tasks for each exercise — again, as someone with no design background but also a high level of perfectionism, I was averaging 3x longer than the estimates, so it made it really difficult to plan my time. I also wish we had the opportunity to work with real clients during the program, as I'm trying to navigate that now as a freelancer and unsure of where I might run into pitfalls. I do like the Slack community they've built, and have found that the people who work for the organization — tutors, mentors, career advisors, Slack channel moderators — are all really friendly and helpful, and I'm grateful to all of them for the guidance and resources they've provided me with so far. Ultimately, I'm glad I did it, but if I had to do it all over, I personally would pick a program that offered an in-person program, as I think, as a career changer, I would have benefitted more from immediate feedback and asking an instructor questions during a lesson.",coursereport

I spent over six months applying for UX jobs and never got a single interview. They have a career coach but they did not really help much. They gave common-sense advice that did not help with the job search and any meaningful way. Because I was a little late meeting with the job coach (they weren't helping me) I was denied the job guarantee. Most of the jobs require that I found required a Masters degree at least.

855,Careerfoundry,2019-08-07,"DISCOUNT LINK for this course, and ALL courses at CareerFoundry This course is an absolute must if you want to survive as a UI, UX, or UI/UX designer, and if like me, you struggle to sit and teach yourself HTML, CSS and Javascript. The real value with this course is the access to the online tutor. All of the information that I learned and the information that ACTUALLY stayed in my head, was all from being able to ask someone a question, and get a direct answer back. I didn't know that this is how I absorb information the best way possible, but it is. I landed a UI/UX designer role not long after completing CareerFoundry's UI designer course DISCOUNT CODE FOR THE COURSE and I truly thought my skills in design would save me from any embarressment - trust me - knowing how NOT to design things that cannot be built by an engineer has been far more valuable. You will earn the price of this course back in no time, not just in terms of salary, but in terms of reducing STRESS when you're in the job. And, if anyone reading this is going into any form of tech design (web, UI/UX, product, interaction, multimedia), make your life easier and get engineers on your side by showing you've taken the time to understand how what they have to do to build a site page or component, works. Believe me, you feel a lot more confident in your abilities and life will be good again! Another HUGE thing about this course is - you build your own online portfolio as a part of the course. I have interviewed at several tech companies who have asked me in the interview to walk them through my portfolio (my projects), and they LOVE it when I tell them I coded my own site. In every UI/UX job advert, you'll see in the requirements ""an understanding of HTML/CSS"" so completing this course allow you (and them) to confidently check that skillset off their list of desirable skills before offering you the job. Finally, the job guarantee that CF offers....worth its weight in gold. The careers advisor (Sami) helped me write cover letters, plan my CV/portfolio, and taught me how to research salaries. We covered interview techniques, and hunting in the job market, which is backed up by their job guarantee! Paying for a private career advisor alone is more than the cost of this entire course.

My tutor was by far the best resource for me in terms of absorbing the information. I learn better from asking direct questions and having someone walk me through the answers.

I haven't studied for the last 10 years and I have absolutely no knowledge about UX whatsoever. I was skeptical and scared that I did the biggest mistake of my life. As of now, I'm about to finish my UX course and I've learned tremendously. I can do stuff, I had no idea about still a few months ago. CF gave me the fundamental knowledge to start a career in the UX field and I'm so grateful for that! The course is extremely well structured, perfectly adapted for people starting from scratch. Every task provides examples of what they expect from you and the whole course is based on projects, so you apply what you've learned right away after each task. Additionally, you get support from the student community, your mentor and your tutor, so it makes learning online easier since you're not alone. Besides that, you get an amazing job preparation so that once you finish the course you know what to expect and how to behave and speak during interviews to land your first UX job. In a nutshell, every single minute spent on this course was definitely worth it and I can only recommend it! Btw: It was such a rewarding experience that I've decided to enroll in the UI course as well ;)",coursereport
860,Careerfoundry,2019-06-14,"A few months ago, I was a reader as well as many of you right now searching through the best course for you. The price, other reviews, and job guarantee were my signup triggers, and I am very satisfied so far. The content is rich and structured. Student advisors are always in touch with you, the mentor and tutor are great ( means they are supportive, you will get quick feedback etc.) I started a few days ago with Job preparation, but I am sure things there are going great as well. I can recommend the CareerFoundry as you will work on real projects, and you will have a ready portfolio for job searching.",coursereport
861,Careerfoundry,2019-06-13,"I am halfway through the UX Design course now. I have to say, I learned a lot already. I really feel that I am ready to go out there and use my knowledge. I am doing this course full time. And it really is like a full-time job. I feel like I am not only getting prepared to be a UX Designer but also to become a freelancer. The course is well structured. It starts with a fast-paced UX introduction with a quick run through all steps of Design thinking and some important methods with a practical project. Followed by a big project with 6 modules, where you dive deeper into the whole process and different methodologies. I really like the CF community. In Slack, you have the possibility to help each other which sometimes is really helpful and motivating if you get stuck. For people living in Berlin, you even get the possibility to meet fellow students. CF invites for productivity workshops or speed networking events or offers the possibility to go to job fairs. I am really happy about the regular Skype calls with my mentor. He is really knowledgable and motivating and has helped me in difficult times, and gives great advice. I can absolutely recommend this course.",coursereport
862,Careerfoundry,2019-06-13,"I'm halfway through my course, and I must say that it has been really great so far. The material and tasks are very informative and well structured. And as it has a lot of small tasks (with an estimated time for completion) it's very fun and motivating to constantly complete new tasks, plus my tutor and mentor have given me great and thoughtful feedback! I couldn't be happier at the moment. Conserning my lack of rating the Job Assistance, is because I haven't started on that yet.",coursereport
863,Careerfoundry,2019-06-11,"After thoroughly researching the various different courses available, I decided on this one as it was advertised as a course which would enable its students to build an e-commerce site from scratch. I work for my family business who were in need of a new website and this course appeared to offer me the means of building one. The first third of the course concentrated on front end development; HTML, CSS and a little jQuery and Bootstrap were used to build a portfolio website. The remaining two thirds was the main project: an e-commerce website built using ruby on rails. This course is advertised as not needing any previous coding experience but I'm afraid this just isn't the case. Thankfully I had already completed several courses on Udemy, Code Academy and Free Code Camp before starting this course because I otherwise would have been completely and utterly lost. The instructions were often vague and I spent hours and hours scouring Stack Overflow and Google trying to find where I'd gone wrong only to find out a key step had been entirely omitted from the instructions, or was explained in the next lecture. The course promised a fully deployable e-commerce site but unfortunately all it did was scratch the surface of how to build a simple site; nowhere near a fully useable one. There was no admin interface built (although that was an optional extra project with no instructions), no shopping basket/add to order etc. Now for the pros. My tutors and mentor were all lovely and very helpful, although I was assigned to two or three different tutors/mentors initially. I had two tutors leave during my time on the course but was offered extra time to make up for this. The tutors on Slack were also very helpful even though I was not assigned to them. The Slack community were also very helpful where they could (especially when it came to errors in the instructions). I fell pregnant whilst doing the course, and CareerFoundry were very supportive. Not only did they give me an extra month to finish the course out (beyond the two month built in flexible time), but they also allowed me to put the job prep course and job guarantee on hold whilst I had my maternity leave. On the whole, I definitely did learn a lot on this course; primarily the reality of being a developer - spending most of your time searching for code solutions and debugging your code! However I felt that for the cost of the course (£3k at the time I did it) the content was very poorly thought out and put together and often backwards in order causing hours of needless headache. After I completed this course I took a ruby on rails course on Udemy for £11.99 which was far cleaner, concise and much easier to understand. From what I've read the job prep course and the support you receive after when looking for a job is superb, however I was lucky enough to land a job off my own bat based on other websites and projects I'd built prior to the course. I finished with the impression that this course has been an add on/afterthought to the certified UX course. It seemed hastily thrown together, and it didn't hold much/any weight in my job interviews. My advice: either do the certified UX course or spend a lot less money and get much better courses on Udemy and the like.",coursereport
864,Careerfoundry,2019-06-09,"I enrolled in the Certified UX Designer course in hopes of paving a new path for myself. I was working in the fundraising industry and was looking for a new challenge and a new career. This course with CF has not disappointed. Fundamentals set me up with a holistic job preview for what lay ahead for me in UX design while creating a foundation of confidence for the successive achievements. Along the way, my tutor and the online Slack community have supported me, helping combat imposter syndrome as a newcomer to the industry. The course continues to be engaging and informative as I try my hand at other tasks I hope to repeat as I grow in the field. I strongly recommend CF for students who are ready to be immersed in a collaborative, challenging and extremely interesting and motivating educational environment and launch their career in UX!",coursereport

I've been familiarizing myself with industry terms that I'm sure will come in handy in a professional environment. I'll update my review nearer the end of the course, but so far I have nothing to criticize. The only thing I might have wished for is an app so I could more easily access course material on the go.",coursereport

My employer has been very supportive of my choice, which was a bonus. The course provides a thorough overview of the UX design process. The clear focus on practical exercises is really what boosted my learning curve. My tutor and mentor were great: Very experienced and skilled. They provided the right balance of valuable, constructive feedback whilst staying supportive and encouraging when I got a bit lost along the way.

868,Careerfoundry,2019-05-30,"Overall, the Certified UX Design course with CareerFoundry was a great experience! The online curriculum and platform allowed me to continue working full-time while balancing my responsibilities as a busy parent. I would not have been able to make a career transition without this type of flexibility. It definitely was not easy and there were many late nights. But looking back over the last year, I am amazed at the amount knowledge I gained and work produced into a portfolio that I am proud of. The support and feedback from my mentor, James and tutor, Kim were invaluable and a key ingredient to this as well. I cannot imagine going through the course without their expertise that comes from thier real-world working experience. They also challenged me in ways that made me into a much stronger designer. The one piece of advice I would give to new students, is to try and read ahead on assignments and discuss them with your mentor before completing the work for each one. Sometimes your mentor will want you to complete coursework a little different than the online instructions just because it will help make a stronger portfolio piece. So, reading and discussing assignments ahead will save you time from back-tracking and making revisions after turning them in. If you are considering signing up for this course, I would not hesitate. But,understand it does take a lot of time, hard work, and determination. It's not easy, but well worth the investment!",coursereport
869,Careerfoundry,2019-05-29,"Wanted to say how good an experience I had with Career Foundry. I took some convincing to try something new, but after a lot of research I'm so glad I chose this particular course. The curriculum was laid out in logical steps, starting with learning the software, building your knowledge of design theory and UI/UX, then ended with a strong emphasis on building a professional portfolio. I knew the course would be tough, but any time I felt stuck or had an issue their support service was right there to help. You also have access to the Career Foundry Slack channels, to reach out for help from your peers on the course. Finding a job afterwards was obviously hard, but you do have access to regular calls and help from a career specialist to point you in the right direction. Luckily I got my first UI Job after 3 months (and about 60 applications...) so I'm proof this course can work for anyone interested in changing their career! Special thanks to my course tutor Henrietta for all the critique and advice, and also my career specialist Richard for all his help after I finished the course.",coursereport
870,Careerfoundry,2019-05-18,"Overall my experience taking this course was very good. The CF dashboard is really well designed, and the content and materials are really good. After finishing the course you can really get a very good idea of what the UX Design role is about. And because most of the companies that look for Ux professionals do not really know about the discipline and role, you can really grow and make an impact in the IT world. You will finish the course having an interesting Portfolio (after submitting all your tasks) that can help you to land your first UX designer job. I strongly recommend this course to everyone working in tech, also those like me that want to go more into frontend development. The only downside of the course is that mentorship is based on Skype. My personal feeling is that the professors are overwhelmed by the amount of revisions they need to take care of. Unfortunately, the feedback was not so deep and personalized as I expected. In my opinion, this has nothing to do with the quality of the mentors/tutors. Mine were great! Is more about the whole 100% online course system. So to summarize: I’d recommend this UX course to everyone, including web developers and marketing people or even product managers working in It!",coursereport

872,Careerfoundry,2019-05-15,"I went with CareerFoundry after looking into three (Tradecraft, Springboard, and General Assembly) back in June 2018. I went with CareerFoundry because at that point, I came with no experience (just eagerness and determination!) and wanted the job guarantee, which Springboard did not have at that time. I have to say this was the best decision for me at that time because now it is May 2019 and I am very confident I have the skills necessary to transition into a UX career. There are weekly Skype calls with a mentor, the ability to specialize in another skill (learn more UI, learn VUI, or a bit of front-end coding) to add an extra piece to your portfolio. The purpose of these UX programs is not the certificate of completion, per se, but more so you leave with a portfolio that you're proud of showing to the design community and for job applications. For anyone who is still on the fence, I recommend talking to people who have already graduated from the courses and are either searching for a job or already have a job.

I really appreciate the nice gesture and the fact that he is really trying to help students achieve their goals. Thanks, Martin! My tutor- Carlo and my mentor- Margarida are amazing too! They are both highly experienced in the industry and they are always there to help. I requested for Carlo to be my mentor in my Specialization course too and it was certainly the right decision! He's been really helpful; not only that he makes sure I am on the right track, he also gives advice based on real-life experience and examples. I truly believe I'm in good hands!

I learned about CareerFoundry through a Medium blog post and went down the rabbit hole from there. I signed up for a short free course to get a sense of how the information would be presented, then chatted with one of the school's advisors. Within a month I was enrolled. Here is what I love: - Career Foundry partners with SkillsFund to provide loan options. This was a selling factor for me. I applied, was approved, and now a pay a decently low rate to learn not only UX/UI but Front End Development as well. - You get a mentor. My mentor is Maria and she's amazing. She is patient with me and blows my mind every time we meet. You have the ability to meet with your mentor however frequently you desire. What is great about this, is that they work in the industry that you will be transitioning into. - You get a Tutor. My tutor is Johnny and well, he is a lot in all of the good ways. Johnny will ensure you fully comprehended the lesson and will provide all the feedback your heart desires. He has high expectations and does his due diligence to ensure your work is up to par with where it needs to be in order to be successful within this industry. - You get access to an advisor and the CF slack community. - The material is presented exceptionally well. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to keep up but it is self-paced. - I haven't even finished the course yet and I already landed a job doing exactly what I want to be doing. I really can't speak highly enough. I am still completing my way through the course but I learn so much that is applicable to my current career. I am able to apply the methods in real time.

I could then focus on the courses, and realised that the course is designed with ample time to work on the tasks. Even before finishing the courses, as a UX Design student, I noticed a huge increase in responses I was getting from employers.

881,Careerfoundry,2018-12-03,"I have a Bachelor in Communication Studies and English is still a big obstacle in my career. So when I realized that I can not become a journalist in my new residence country, I start looking around for other options. I did my research and I start thinking about programming and web development. I had no idea what is what and what do I have to do, so Google became my best friend for the first weeks. I started several free tutorials but without having someone to show me and a real path to follow, it was pretty hard to do it. This is how I decided to register for the Career Foundry Web Development course. I was amazed by the structure of the course: you have around 10 assignments for each unit. At the end of each assignment, your personal tutor is going to review your work and give his feedback. At the end of each unit, you will have a video feedback from your mentor, reviewing your entire work and suggesting you any improvements. In the beginning, it was hard as I knew nothing about web development but slowly-slowly, with a lot of work from my side and a lot of patience from my tutor and mentor, I went through the entire course in less than 6 months, meanwhile working a fulltime job. I knew nothing about websites, how are they made or how they work, but the course thought me everything: a bit of front-end, a bit of back-end and hocus-pocus: at the end of the course, I had an entire portfolio that I used at my interviews. At the end of the web development course, I had a job preparation course where I learned a lot of tips and tricks specific for this field but also practice for job interviews. My career advisor was amazing and she helped me to overtake my fears and to be confident with my new skills. Less than 6 months after I finished my course, I've got not one, but two job offers. One of which was an internship from a company where I was dreaming to work at, but with a year before I wasn't able to pass their coding interview. Now, not only that I got the internship, but at the end of the internship period (4 months) I received a permanent, full-time job offer from them. Web development is a competitive field and the learning never really stops. I am so proud of myself to say that I am a developer and I suggest to anyone who wants to change their career to follow their dreams and to start learning. Career Foundry is definitely a very good start and teaches you not only the basics but also some advanced techniques. Plus, you have their full-time support both for assignments and job preparation.

882,Careerfoundry,2018-10-24,"Certified UX Design: As a career changer with a degree in Graphic Design, I am very happy to have taken this course to become a Certified UX Designer. I thoroughly enjoyed the learning experience with Careerfoundry. During the course, I designed a Task Management app, by conducting a case study to define users and pain points. I learned tools such as sketch (and others) from scratch and greatly enjoyed this learning process. At times the course was a test in perseverance, but the step by step approach to the material really helped me to stay on track, together with the advice from my very helpful and positive tutor and mentor. Both of them readily gave me feedback and support, whenever I needed it, material to read up on, work with or in order to understand certain concepts in more depth. It was a pleasure and an honour to work with both. Furthermore, it was valuable to have such an enthusiastic student community, that provides useful advice and support. Job Prep: This course I took after the completion of my UXD course and I can really recommend it. The course not only gives you valuable advice on writing the essential application material such as your CV and cover letter. It also helps you introspect on your transferable skills and the broader picture of a job-hunt process, as well as encouraging you to design a professional portfolio website. That way it structures your 'job-hunt phase', which is naturally not always easy. I continue to stick to the structure in this course throughout my current job search and have had several interviews already. I would like to add, that the calls with my career specialist were really valuable, as she gave me great advice, adding the perspective of an HR specialist. This experience I wouldn't normally have had the chance of gaining. Also, I would like to mention that all CF career specialists are very helpful (and continue to be, even after course completion) and always get back to me with advice and feedback on my interview material, great links and video sessions. In total, my experience with CF has been a very positive one. I took my UXD course from Jan-Aug 2018, Job Prep from August to September 2018.",coursereport

By the completion of the course (if you are already an intermediate developer) you feel that you can develop a simple application and can control many important parameters related to frontend and backend and this make you happy like adding a plugin and modifying website by modern tools. Career advisor helps you in preparing your CV, LinkedIn, and other social profiles. They really help with job applications and interviews. students learn a lot about polishing resumes and importance of social contacts. job preparation exercises are excellent. Cons: This course is not for beginners. Job guarantee is a trap. They have not mentioned the term and conditions for the refund on the Job Guarantee page. ( https://careerfoundry.com/en/job-guarantee ) rather this is mentioned somewhere on the website. ( Please read paragraph 15 https://admin.careerfoundry.com/en/terms ) This course does not prepare you for the job market as a developer with PROGRAMMING skills. In the job market, most of the companies are looking for a candidate with sound programming skills(even for junior). You can develop web apps without being a programmer by watching Udemy courses. but in the real world, the demand is opposite because the companies are looking for more of a programmer type candidate with the knowledge of developing tools. Its like (70% programming and 30 % other tools) In my humble opinion, an average student cannot learn all skills required for a job in six months (programming and developing tools). Hence Job guarantee and the course do not meet the reality. 1. The course does not show the ability to prepare students for programming skill with tutor assisted exercise. 2. Terms and condition should be mentioned properly without moral corruption.",coursereport
890,Careerfoundry,2018-06-15,"I came across Careerfoundry through another colleague who was also about to enroll in the course. The website really spoke to me - I was feeling stuck at my job and had no sense of where I should go. I decided to speak to CF's Career Advisor (Sam), who helped me to set aside my anxieties / fears of changing a career. I am so so glad I made this decision. I signed up for the UX certified course (June 2017), completed the immersion course early (Feb 2017), and spent 2 months prepping my UX portfolio and interviews. I applied to a total of 15 jobs, got 7 call backs and 2 offers. It really was a dream come true for me. Careerfoundry is an amazing platform to help you go through this transition - learn new skills and get into the exciting field of UX. I know CF foundry tries very hard to offer the best support and have the best mentors from the industry but it doesn't always happen in real life. My UX course mentor and tutor were both incredibly amazing. Always reachable, helpful and got back to any of my inquiries really fast. However, my experience with my UI specialization course was the complete opposite. The mentor was not very engaged with the course, didn't offer much feedback (ex. your design is perfect, on to the next) and also wouldn't read my comments properly). Though I had unlimted Skype call with him, I really didn't see much point in calling him, as he really wasn't helpful at all. This is why i only gave a 4 star under ""instructors"". Careerfoundry would be the perfect platform for you if you are looking into changing your career and start working as a UX designer. As long as you are motivated and wiilling to dedicate the time and hard work, it's going to pay off. I was working 40 hours a week while studying UX on the side so it was extremely tough but i am glad it's all worth it in the end.",coursereport
891,Careerfoundry,2018-06-07,"I started learning web development course on Nov 15, 2017 and graduated on Mar 27, 2018. I found a job at GTA area on Apr 19, 2018. It's not web developer, but network administrator. The course is well designed and I think I'm a qualified junior web developer after completing the course. However, it's still not easy to find a job by just completing the boot camp. Most jobs require degrees or years of experience. The only opportunity is small start-up companies with low salary, but you cannot expect too much as a rookie. Right? Career foundry helps me in multiple aspects. 1. Job guarantee reduces my anxiety which is the biggest headache for me. 2. The community of mentor, tutor, career coach and other alumni makes me feel that I’m not working alone. 3. Although my job is network administrator, my skills in web development helps me to win the job. (1) In order to configure the Linux environment to run Ruby on Rails, I learned linux system and I was experienced with virtual machine, SSH connection etc., which is useful for a network administrator (2) Interviewer asked me some details of my web development skills. Basically my web development skill let them believe that I’m a fast learner and I understand how to make different software work together.",coursereport
892,Careerfoundry,2018-05-16,"I wanted to change careers from graphic design to UX design. I joined CareerFoundry and loved my experience with them. I was paired with a great mentor. He was very helpful, understanding, patient, and empathetic. He helped me learn the ins and outs of UX and prepare and practice for the interviews. They have a great team of career specialists too who help you with the interviews and give you tips on your job search. Almost a month after graduation, I got my first UX job in a well known company. Career Foundry makes learning UX fun and you get to work on two portfolio pieces during the course.",coursereport
893,Careerfoundry,2018-04-23,"The course was pretty well structured, the exercises provide you with a pretty solid portfolio as a beginner. I got offered a job as a UX designer even before graduating, based on the portfolio that was randomly found by someone who was looking on Behance. Of course it will not teach you everything you need to know about UX - there's not enought tiem for that - but it will give you a great fundament to start.",coursereport
894,Careerfoundry,2018-04-19,"Preface: First off, I have to say that almost everyone I know these days is ""thinking about learning programming"" or ""learning programming on the side right now"". They mention weird words like React and Node.JS, or Rainbow-Trout-Power-Language, whatever it is they try to assure you that whatever you thought is the right thing to learn is wrong, and that their flavor of the week is more important. At the end of the day, Career Foundry got me to actually learn the programming languages and also develop projects - and there is a lot to be said for action vs. talk. Why I liked the course: First off, the way the course is made, you actually have to finish it, otherwise you suffer a financial penalty. This to me is perfect, because bootcamps that say you can take as long as you want, are not really there to help you get into the industry rather than fulfill your fantasy of 'kind-of' learning a programming language. This is just my opinion of course, but I really needed a timeline where I had to complete things, as my life is too busy and without an externally motivated deadline, it would likely slip. The course content itself is pretty good, it gets you through the languages as you build up projects in the course. To be honest, you can learn anything on the internet for free, but why Career Foundry was nice is because they sequence the learning in a way that makes sense. When learning web dev, there are inevitable times when you require knowledge from a more advanced topic to explain a simpler one. CF gets around this quite well by giving you disclaimers like, ""don't worry, we'll explain this later"" and then they ACTUALLY DO explain it, unlike the last season of the TV show LOST. The best part of the course though is that someone grades every assignment (pass or fail). I once had my assignment rejected because the code wasn't formatted nicely. The code worked fine, and met all the objectives, but looked ugly. While this may sound frusterating, this is the most real world example of something that is really important which you can lose sight of just coding on your own. Finally, the job prep course at the end I would say is one of the most valuable parts of the course. Learning a new skill for me is relatively easy compared to the daunting task of looking for work in a new skill, fighting against your own biases about you not being ready enough etc...The job prep course was a lot of work, and I somehow didn't know you only had a month after you are done your main course to finish it (which I think could be boldly articulated at the start of the course that you need to finish it by the date - this got confusing for me as the date was changed a few times). But those things aside, the work you put in really sets you up to look for work. It's tough, and at times gruelling, but I have never been so confident in my resume and cover letter writing skills as I am now. I had multiple reviews of my resume, with minute changes on things such as the structure of sentences and wording - which are all things I would have not caught if completely on my own. I guess it was nice to know that by the end of that, I was ready mentally to look for work. Things I would improve about the course: There were a few times the course content had errors that caused a lot of rework. I found the best way to check if this was the case was simply by looking at the student comments on the lesson. Sometimes there were multiple of the same comment and that helped save me from falling into the same trap. I would suggest CF should go through the comments on each lesson to help find these issues. I submitted a lot of course feedback of as many errors as I could find, but sometimes you don't have the time I feel at the end of each unit, there should be a mandatory project that fores you to have to apply the principles on your own (instead of optional). I really don't like the approach that you are just 'done' the unit one you get through each assignment and feel like this would be a great opportunity to weave in things like interview coding challenges etc... I experienced a lot of variance with the tutors. I personally feel you should have a mini skype call where you introduce yourselves to each other at the start of the course, as at times it just feels like someone is copy pasting ""Great work! You clearly met the requirements etc..."" vs. actually giving you feedback. Since the whole course is online, these opportunities to make things feel a bit more connected I feel shouldn't be overlooked. Things I would tell myself now after finishing the course: Don't get over confident at the start of the course, it is designed to be easier at the beginning. Eventually you will run into a lesson which takes an insane amount of time to get right, and you need to be okay with that. Remember, your tutor has to approve your results, and sometimes you will go back and forth for a few days on one lesson, while other days you will complete two lessons in one day. Really begin with the end in mind, and don't plan to use the portfolio made in the course as your own professional one. That is just an example project and in my opinion makes a lot of design decisions that may or may not make sense for you. Pick ONE (not 100) other resources like Ruby done the hard way or Object Oriented programming books, and make a goal of completing some of that content with each lesson. The course is not going to teach you everything you need to know (no course will) so you need to get used to self learning now. The job prep course is a lot of work. Don't underestimate it, but also realize it is making your life 10 times easier than it would be on your own. If you put a lot of effort in that course at the end it will pay huge dividends.",coursereport
895,Careerfoundry,2018-04-15,"I decided to change career from marketing to UX design and enrolled on the UX course. Although when I finished the course I felt that I still was lacking a lot of practice in the field, I got a very good knowledge of what a UX designer should do and know. In order to get more practice the course shoud be longer because some skills they just need practice and time to be developped. Also the course prepared me on how to present my work and my creative processes to potential employers, which I think has been very useful. I also found very useful the active student community, I have got great help from it. For example, I got to know other fellow students who have ended up helping me a lot on my portfolio and job application documents and it has been a useful source to start networking. And last when I finished the course I got good couching from CF team on how to do my interviews and landed up on my first UX job through the CF network only one month and a half after I finished the course.",coursereport
896,Careerfoundry,2018-04-12,"Firstly, I would like to congratulate CareerFoundry for such an affordable program in getting started in web developement! Due to the U.S. market and my location, I was not able to procure a job in 6 months yet they did honour their job gaureente, as always make sure one reads the terms and abides. However, the program itself prepared me for a subsquent local in-house boot camp and now has the pleasure of calling myself not only a full-stack Ruby on Rails web developer but as an upgrade to software developer upon adding the .Net (C#) stack. With the work of the CareerFoundry team has been able to position myself for growth and future success within the tech space by providing me with a module to prepare me for the current and future job market along the main course. I am forever grateful for CareerFoundry team for allowing me to get a good start on my training as a developer and thus happily satistfied. The only thing missing is a JS framework like Angular, React, or Vue was taught which would have enhanced ability to get hired.",coursereport
897,Careerfoundry,2018-04-09,Bad experance. The course does not get you ready for interviews. You will be tested. They will not help you pass. That is hardest part of getting the job. Their terms and conditions protect their butts from ever having to give a refund and they will find every excuse in the book not to give it to you and stop replying when they run out. I recommend just buying a book like cracking the code interview and avoid this program at all costs.,coursereport
898,Careerfoundry,2018-03-24,"I wanted to change careers to UX Design and chose CareerFoundry for my training. Although based in Berlin, the course is 100% online (I am based in Canada). What is great about the course is you get to work through some great and important information about UX Design, then send in a task to your tutor. With the UX Immersive class I did, I was assigned a tutor (to check my activities/tasks) and a mentor (to do a portfolio review at the end of each 'achievement'). This is what I loved the most about the course. I got so much great advice and encouragement from my tutor and mentor during this course, they were always around to answer my questions and offer me feedback on the tasks. I think I have grown so much now as a new junior UX Designer to the industry, then when I had first started. The CF slack group was also awesome, so much great advice and help from other students and tutors/the career services team. Whats so great is that everyone at CF wants you to succeed, and do everything in their power to mak it possible. They have updated the curriculum since I first started and now include extra video tutorials and quizzes, which I think is great. Even without them though, I enjoyed the course structure.

900,Careerfoundry,2018-01-29,"I took the UX Designer course last year in January 2017 and graduated in June 2017. My goal was to gain as much knowledge as possible, not just certificate. Therefore I spent weekly more than 20 hours studying and preparing for the assignements. It worth it. The course itself is really well organized and you always get the sense of the progress, even after small achievements. Next to studying I practiced on one real project. It means sometimes I was running after people to get interviews and user feedback. Was an exciting and interesting time. I loved the huge community and the support from my mentor and tutor. They were fast and always there for any questions. Actually thanks to my mentor I got my current position. One Manager in my network was browsing randomly on LinkedIn when my mentor reposted my ux portfolio. The manager contacted me and after few months I got a UX position in one of Switzerland leading bank.

901,Careerfoundry,2017-11-27,"I have been stuck in a rut for so long and was wary of taking a boot camp style course because I am easily demotivated. My CareerFoundry course was completely different from any online course I had taken previously. Although I found that my tutor sometimes was very set in their ways, in real life as a UX Designer you will have a client expecting you to create to their liking. It was so motivational to work with a mentor in the field. My mentor helped me in my interviews, I truly felt like I had a whole team rooting for me. I would definitely recommend this course if you want to change your life with something you are passionate about and do something you love. I never dreamt I could be working as a UX Designer after a 6 month course (I took 8 months due to being a mom and working freelance). CareerFoundry not only prepares you for a career but they help you in the whole process towards applying to jobs and interviewing which is extremely important.

902,Careerfoundry,2017-11-13,"To Make a Long Story Short The UX Designer course at CareerFoundry helped me to evolve my career and to land a job as a Junior UX Designer within three months after I finished the course. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is really interested and willing to make some serious effort. This is not a taster course and you should really be convinced of what you’re doing since you invest a lot of time and money. If you just want to learn more about the basics (so that you can decide better if this is the right thing for you) then you might be better off with the cheaper and shorter UX Fundamentals course offered by CareerFoundry, too. My Personal Professional Background I studied Interface Design as a specialization field of Industrial Design in Germany. After that, I worked as a freelancer on minor complex projects (mostly graphic design) and at a small Start-Up as an Interface Designer. When I began to feel stuck in my career I took some time off to reflect on my very own skills, needs, and motivations. I deepened my knowledge and became even more fascinated by UX. Also, I discovered that I already was (or at least wanted to be) a UX Designer but there were some parts missing. I enrolled as a student at CareerFoundry to close those gaps. My expectations were high. The Course It started quite easy and flat but after just a few lessons it became harder and really rich in content. The schedule was tough and after some time on the course, I had to realize that I wouldn’t be able to finish the course within three months. I put high standards and demands on both myself and the quality of my work. I had to extend the course timeframe which was no problem. My mentor and tutor cheered me up and encouraged me since my submissions have been excellent. The course content has been quite comprehensive and well curated. In real life probably no employer would hardly pay for all the steps taken in the sketched design process but it’s good to have a broad understanding of many different design methods and strategies. The topics that have been taught are not CareerFoundry exclusive. Indeed, you could manage to find and learn everything online for free. The big difference is the very good didactic conditioning and the chunking into lessons and tasks. You will apply what you’ve learned on a real project. Any submission will be reviewed by your tutor (day-to-day tasks) or your mentor (final task of the block) providing valuable feedback. They responded very quickly. I came to know my mentors and tutor to be very committed and I hope we will keep in touch. They have a great attitude of sharing their knowledge and experience. I never felt like I was bothering them and always felt encouraged. Feel free to watch the project showcase on my behance profile: https://www.behance.net/gallery/54800867/Project-Showcase-Taskly-Task-Management-App After The Course When you finalize your course you can optionally take the Career Change Achievement. I would highly recommend this free extension to anyone who is going on job hunt. The lessons give you some very helpful tips and kind of guide you through the first time of your job search. They help (force) you to reflect on yourself and your newly acquired skills. In the end, you will understand yourself a lot better and you will be able to articulate your goals and your strengths in a polished application package. In my personal case, this led to a job offer after three weeks of searching and applying!",coursereport
903,Careerfoundry,2017-10-17,"A joined CareerFoundry's UI course at the beginning of 2017. I had looked over a lot of other courses before starting before deciding CareerFoundry was the best for what I was looking for. I would say that overall, my experience was good! I really enjoyed my mentor and tutors. Occasionally throughout the course I had a few questions that I couldn't find good answers to by just perusing the web. When I reached out to my mentor, I was able to get great answers and hands on instruction until i finally understood. That alone was invaluable to me. As I was approaching the end of the course, I started applying at UI jobs around the country before eventually landing a position at a startup. Occasionally in the interviews, I'd recieve a question that I wasn't sure how to answer - this was, again, where my mentors and tutors helped. Talking with them gave me the confidence to keep applying. I would say that much of the content found throughout the course wasn't exactly mind-blowing or game-changing; it could be found throughout the web if you knew where to look. But CareerFoundry has collected it and given good tutorial of how to get your feet wet into UI. In my opinion, this course won't teach you to become a great designer - but it will help you get into UI if you already know how to design and just aren't sure how to make the transition forward. If that's you, I'd recommend this course! (Btw, I'm now making double my old salary at my new job. Thanks CF!)",coursereport
904,Careerfoundry,2017-10-06,"I took the iOS developer course starting in August '16 and graduated about 6 months later. I have to say that it was a good course and I am now an iOS developer having completed the course within the required 6 months. I thoroughly enjoyed the content and found the exercises to be clear and generally easy to follow. One criticism of the content is that sometimes while searching for answers I would come across almost exactly the same content in free articles. This didn't bother me too much because, for me, the key to this course was the support from a tutor and a mentor. I had tried many times to learn programming on my own using only free resources in the past but it never came to anything because I would get stuck and not have anyone to ask advice from and so lose motivation and interest. The difference with this course is that you do have someone to ask for help if you need it in the form of your tutor, but you also have a community of others who are going through the course and you can also ask for help from them. Generally my tutor and my mentor were very responsive to my questions and quite knowledgable about the exercises and potential solutions. They were both very nice, supportive and helpful however on the odd occassion it did seem like my tutor might not have been through the exercises in full detail. Once I had completed my course I began looking for a job and at this point I felt like maybe the course had not fully prepared me to get my first developer role because I was not getting any responses to the job applications I was making. I also felt like CareerFoundry was more geared towards finding jobs for the web dev/UI/UX graduates simply because there are substantially more people doing those courses. This may have been true however I realised that I had to be persistent and also to continue to develop my skills while I was searching for a job. Eventually, with the help of Sami at CF (who is brilliant) I was able to find an incredible job doing exactly what I want to at a company that does some really exciting stuff. Sami helped me to position myself in the market and to understand the value I could offer to potential employers, rather than just feeling like a novice with no skills! As part of the process for applying to the job I currently have, I was asked to build a mini app and was able to use some of the knowledge I gained doing the course so the content is definitely relevant in the real world. Overall it is a good course because of the tutor/mentor and community aspects. As with any course there are some weaknesses, however you will get out what you put in and if you are willing to put the time and effort in it is possible to find a job as a developer after graduating.",coursereport
905,Careerfoundry,2017-09-06,"I would honestly not recommend this program. This company is a startup and has changed it's curriculum since my graduation 6 months ago. I have a formal degree in art and took the UI design course. Pros -Affordable (the price is cheaper than most bootcamps) -Community (They had a strong online community) -Assignments (You did get good assignments that would help you learn) Cons -Little job placement help (Most of the people I met from CF haven't found jobs, It's been 6 months and I haven't found one either. Most of the job placement help was based on the HQ in Berlin. I also expected them to have relationships with companies for placement which I don't think they have) -Written tutorials (There were plenty of written tutorials that could have been more clear, or were lacking a short video explanation. It's 2017 I was very disappointed that there wasn't a single video tutorial.) -Little to no portfolio help (At my time of graduation there was little to no help to tell you how to make a portfolio that would land you a job, they would just tell you to make a portfolio...) All in all most of the information could be learned on Lynda, Coursera, or Treehouse I thought. If I could do it over...I don't think that I would. The idea that you can pay a few grand and spend a couple months learning to become a designer is a larger one, but have realistic expectations. Google around on medium to see what other designers say. I think that it usually takes years of training and most importantly: WORK EXPERIENCE to land a great design job.",coursereport
906,Careerfoundry,2017-07-06,"A fantastic course. Quick advice is to really use the guide of how many assignments you need to finish a week and not fall behind. With my busy life with a full-time job and young children, it was difficult not to. However, the course made it very easy for me to catch up when I could and my mentor and the student advisors were super supportive and accomodating. I really felt like everyone was there to help me succeed. The Slack community was also incredibly helpful. Being a marketing professional with not much formal education in art and design, this course was extremely educational not only with learning about the world of UI design, but also art theory and training in design, which I really enjoyed. The adminstrators are always changing things so you can be assured that it is always up to date and they also work with feedback to improve it constantly so the course just gets better and better. It is not an easy course, even with someone who has a bit of a design background such as myself, but it is incredibly rewarding. Every time I would see another student's work, I would be a little discouraged and think that I would never achieve something like that. But it also drove me to push myself harder to succeed and I ending achieving much more than I thought I could. I learned to use others work as inspiration and I think it made me a much better designer. If you put the work into it, you will do well.

The staff is responsive and flexible to student needs often changing tutors based upon schedules and needs. It's as simple as a request and following up.

908,Careerfoundry,2017-02-06,"I finished a web dev course at CareerFoundry in about 5 months with 20 hours learning a week. I had no previous experience in this field, except 2 courses at Codecademy. Before everything, here is my opinion about their mentorship: you get a tutor and a mentor, the tutor approves your excercises, so it is a daily communication, the mentor helps with bigger issues and gives you feedback (video review) after each achievement, and there are 4 of them. There are also 4 skype calls with him. My mentor was helpful and answered usually in 1 day. My first tutor probably left CF at the middle of my course, but that was a good thing as she did not do much, only approved all of my tasks without any helpful review or suggestion. My second tutor was the opposite, he was extremely helpful and always gave me extra information. Thanks Judah! So CF promises you could be a web developer after a course, if you follow all the instructions, learning schedule etc. I just finished a course, so I don't have a job yet, I am doing the Career Achievement, which is their help to do a career change and so far it is very helpful. The course content was professional, detailed and understandable, they provide a lot of external links where you can learn more. So basically they give you a really good base knowledge and if you are interested you can build on it. I would say you could be a web developer if you carry on learning and working after the 6 months. I guess it is realistic to get a job you love in 6 months after the course, if you keep working hard and creating more and more projects.",coursereport

Despite the course being advertsied as a UX Design course it was great to have some exposure to some UI in the later stages of the course, which again put me in a great position for future portfolio work and interviews for my first design based job. Allison also had some great advice at the end of the course for trying to secure work. I did find it quite frustrating after the course when CareerFoundry (not Allison) offered to help and advise me with my job search and getting into a career. There was a brief exchange of emails before they stopped replying all together - I even mentioned this in my feedback to them soon after the course was over with no response.

It's a lot of information and it's good to digest it!",coursereport
923,Careerfoundry,2024-12-12,"I have rather enjoyed much of the course. Even though I'm a full time employee at a hospital, married, and have a two year old I've been able to make it work due to their flexibility. Only thing I really found was a pain point was when we had to use large datasets that my computer couldn't handle it. It would bring my machine to a crawl after ever minor change. Which mind you I have a rather beefy system to do my IT job. Not sure if maybe there is a way to use smaller sets, provide virtual labs, etc. Outside of that I'm enjoying it.",coursereport
924,Careerfoundry,2024-11-06,"I completed CareerFoundry’s UX program in March 2024, but despite applying to hundreds of positions since then, I have not gotten a single interview. Following the program, I sought feedback from an experienced design professional, only to discover that my portfolio was considered below industry standards—even though it had been approved by CareerFoundry mentors. I also participated in their 6-month job guarantee program, but unfortunately, I still did not secure any interviews. When I requested a refund, I was informed that I was ineligible due to a lack of “proper documentation” and because I had not met with my mentor every two weeks. This was challenging to accomplish, as my mentor had personal issues that led to canceled calls, and my full-time job made rescheduling difficult. I was also told that I needed to check in with my mentor biweekly, but he would regularly not respond to me, or get back to me days later so what was the point of checking in this often. Reflecting on the program, I feel that CareerFoundry’s job guarantee and strict policies seem designed to attract students rather than prepare them for success and realities in the design field. About two-thirds of the way through, I started noticing a lack of detailed instruction on essential design topics like accessibility, spacing, color, and typography. While these topics were mentioned in assignments, they were often too vague to apply effectively. I gained far more insight through my own research and guidance from industry professionals than from the program itself, leaving me feeling misled. When I requested a phone call to discuss the refund, I was told CareerFoundry didn’t have enough staff for a conversation—a surprising response from a company centered on UX, where user insights should be a priority. At this point, I am genuinely disappointed with my experience in this program.To anyone considering CareerFoundry’s UX program, I would advise looking elsewhere.",coursereport
925,Careerfoundry,2024-10-30,I've been in this course since July 2024. I've enjoyed learning to navigate Excel and Tableau thus far.

I am in the UX Design program and in the beginning I was scared because I’ve never had any experience in like web design or graphic design so I thought I was going to struggle and fall behind. Boy was I wrong, Every task they give you gives a detailed explanation on the history behind what you are learning and how it has evolved. The mentor and instructors are super helpful whenever you are stuck on something and give great feedback on when you complete an assignment. I would definitely give this experience so far a 10/10 I feel more motivated knowing I have a good support group backing me up and I’m having fun learning new things.",coursereport
928,Careerfoundry,2024-09-20,"So far, my bootcamp experience has been a lot to take in. At CareerFoundry, they provide numerous tools to help you succeed, but it’s up to you to make the most of them. The content is thorough, and the tutors always respond to my questions and review my work within 48 hours. My mentor does the same and takes the time to assess my work, offering valuable guidance. With over 10 years of industry experience, I make sure to listen to her advice.The bootcamp also offers a Slack channel, which is quite active. However, the forums on the CareerFoundry website are not very lively, at least for my program. With so much information available, it can be challenging not to feel overwhelmed. I find it easier to manage by taking it one day at a time and doing my best.Although I am only halfway through the bootcamp, I am optimistic that I will secure a job and start my new career soon after completing it.

My tutor John has made me so confident now in troubleshooting my own code, something that was very daunting at first. Everyone else that I ever came in contact with from the careerfoundry team were also very helpful and always messaged me back in a timely manner, often times the same day.

933,Careerfoundry,2024-08-16,"Pros: CareerFoundry offers excellent tutor and mentor guidance, with timely and constructive feedback that significantly enhances the learning experience. The course content is thorough and covers a wide range of digital marketing skills through well-designed projects. Cons: The AI Explain feature doesn't always function properly, and while the yellow highlight tool is a helpful addition, it can be buggy and sometimes doesn't disappear as expected. Suggestions for Improvement: 1. Communication with student advisors and the Bildungsgutschein team could be improved. The current system, relying on Zendesk tickets or email, is slow and feels overly administrative. Implementing a chat feature within the portal for these purposes, similar to the chat features for mentors and tutors, could streamline communication and make it more efficient. 2. Additionally, Achievement 2 in the course could benefit from restructuring. It should be divided into two separate segments for SEO and email marketing. The current structure feels overwhelming, with tasks that are too demanding and could lead to burnout. Breaking it down would make it more manageable for students. Moreover, allocating a small budget for a paid keyword research tool would ease the process, as most free tools lack the necessary features to perform comprehensive keyword research.",coursereport

The flexibility of timing was also a big reason I chose CareerFoundry over other bootcamps and that is working very well for me now. I'm able to work extra fast during less busy months at work to account for later busy periods. My only slight criticism would be that as the texts are quite long, it would be nice if there were a more equal mix of reading and videos.

Definitely recommend.",coursereport

975,Careerfoundry,2023-07-23,Perhaps I didn't look into it enough to fully understand how I would learn however I was expecting more engagement rather then reading and completing task after task with only a mentor and a tutor to assist.

I got a job in UX after only two months of starting the course. While I already had some previous training and experience, having the course listed on my CV helped me to get noticed by recruiters. The mentor and tutor I was paired with are friendly and encouraging. They helped me prepare for my interviews and checked in to see how I was doing. The student community is also very welcoming and always ready to help. The only downside so far is that some of the external links they suggest as optional/further reading are old/outdated. Also, the lessons could do with more media, like videos, animations, etc. They are heavy on text which might be easier and cheaper to update but is not quite as engaging.",coursereport

1010,Careerfoundry,2023-03-29,"Read the small letter of the Job Guarantee, you're most likely not to get your money back. On one hand, the Career Specialist recommends being smart and searching for interesting jobs that will be fulfilling, yet, the small letter states that there's a min of 5 applications a week to apply, plus direct contacts and assistance to UX events. Networking outside of Germany or US is almost non-existent and the job offers inside their platform are mostly for these two countries. My teachers were good, yet, other students complain a lot about what the mentor said vs. what the tutor said so feedback is confusing. It also won't take you five months, especially if you are working full time, so calculate about a year if that is your case. And, don't expect a lot of incoming jobs inside their platform to look somewhere else if that's your case. Overall, the content was good, but I expected more and their messaging is very deceitful.",coursereport
1011,Careerfoundry,2023-03-26,"I am currently doing the UX Design Immersion course with CareerFoundry. I have been enjoying the programme so far and feeling that I am on track to be a UX Designer! What I like most about the programme is that the curriculum is very structured, breaking projects into small, more digestible chunks. It has enough theory, in the meantime very hands on and practical. The course contents are concise enough to learn overview of new topics, at the same time, there are plenty additional reading material to go deeper into certain areas of interest. I feel confident that I am preparing for my portfolio whilst learning all the new knowledge and techniques. This is an online course. However, each of us is allocated with a mentor and a tutor, and there are plenty interactions with them, including video calls which we can schedule with our mentor. I enjoy the interactions with my tutor and mentor; in fact, everyone whom I have interacted with at CareerFoundry are friendly and helpful. I also find the learning platform very easy to use and it gives me the structure to know what I am aiming to complete/ learn, and what I have achieved. There is a Slack student community - personally, I haven't spent much time on the community so far. Recently, I joined a live design workshop with other CF students, which I find very useful and I hope there will be more of these organised. I'd considered other bootcamps when I was making the decision. One of the reasons why I chose CareerFoundry is their career support; I will be able to access to a career advisor once I have completed more than 50% of my immersion course, which I am looking forward to! Overall, I like CareerFoundry's curriculum and the fact that it provides the flexibility for me to learn at my own pace, and still knowing I can reach out anytime for support from my mentor and tutor. So far, I am glad that I've chosen CareerFoundry to start my UX Design journey!",coursereport

Right now, I've finished the Intro and Immersion course already and applying to internships, so I can't give you an accurate gauge on how well the course prepares you for a job, but I can say that the course teaches you very thoroughly the things you need to know, and the work you are asked to do is a good reflection of it. Of course, like all education, what you learn doesn't always represent reality, but it sets the right foundation for your future. Along the way, you'll also have no less than 3 people helping you (tutors, advisors, and mentors) so don't worry too much about working with the material alone.

1038,Careerfoundry,2023-01-05,"I can not say enough positive things about my experience with CareerFoundry. From the start of the course I felt incredibly supported by my tutor and mentor who were always available when I needed clarity surrounding the material I was being presented. Further, this is a major career change for me, but the material is very easy to comprehend. As a former teacher, I really like their project based learning style where you are able to go through 15-30 minutes of reading, take a brief assessment, and then complete a project to deepen your understanding. If you are driven to learn independently with the assistance of others when you need it, then this is the course for you!",coursereport
1039,Careerfoundry,2023-01-03,I love Career Foundry because I am able to work at my own pace which is great for those looking for a career switch while still working full time. They match you with a Tutor who is very responsive and gives constructive feedback. 10/10 recommend,coursereport

The curriculum is great and it is really fun to learn, since you are taking what you learn and practice it in a task right away.

I highly recommend the program.",coursereport

Her friend had done this program, and after doing some research, I found this program to have the best qualities that I was looking for. I haven't completed the course yet, but I have been able to work with an industry professional (who I look up to greatly). She has been incredibly helpful in solidifying my designs as well as encouraging me to strive to create higher quality designs with each iteration and each project. I feel very comfortable with my tutor, who grades most of my assignments, as well. He's very kind yet instructive, and I feel like I am able to learn something new each time he reviews my assignments. He also has an abundance of resources that have been helping me along the way.",coursereport

I like that material of each lesson is very well built and structured. After each lesson there are plenty of additional things to read and watch on the topic. The most important part in my opinion is that I, as a student, always have support of tutor and mentor. This is so valuable for me as for a person who is changing career and meets a lot of challenges on my way. Having good feedback helps me to improve my skills and gives me more confidence. I'm glad I have professionals who are always here to help and cheer me up. Even though I study on my own I don't feel alone at all.

1058,Careerfoundry,2022-11-15,"I already have a design background and degree and soo excited about this program. I did enjoy the UI program itself and completed it in January 2022. Unfortunately, if you hope to find a job after this program (intern or entry-level), it's not as easy as they make it out to be and after being told how good my work is and I won't have any issues finding a role in this field. I suggest completing the specialization course if you want any chance of a course refund ( part of their Job Guarantee policy) if you do not land a job within the allotted time frame. That is one thing I regret not completing, the animation specialization was not written as well as the UI course and I lost interest as it was too confusing to follow. What it comes down to is, you will just not be job ready after the UI program unless you have a contact that helps you, it comes down to who you know basically. Currently, I am working in a completely unrelated field after being told that I do not have enough experience over and over after my final interview rounds. Not sure if I will even try again for UI as much as I was hoping it just became quite discouraging especially after you invest your time and money into something with hopes of landing a job.",coursereport

I have only had 1 issue regarding my mentoring, but it was resolved in a timely manner by my student advisors. I can confidently recommend this course to anyone looking to enter the design field or to further increase their qualifications.",coursereport
1061,Careerfoundry,2022-11-07,The course has been fully in depth into each step of the UX design process and UX design career as a whole. Having the mentors each step of the way has been a nice tool and good practice. The course gives you all the tools to learn UX design but it is on you to learn new softwares and eventually build your profile up enough to show to potential employers. I haven’t finished the course fully just yet but so far I’ve enjoyed it!,coursereport

The thing is sometimes the coursework does not match the tasks itself. I'm only talking about the UX Immersion part of it. I don't think many programs will be perfect, but I think CareerFoundry hires great mentors for the students to feel confident in applying to jobs. I not only learned and am learning fantastic UX foundations, but also I'm learning a lot about myself as well. It's been a great ride. Moreover I highly suggest the Voice Specialization course because it's such a new area and CF actually offers it.",coursereport

Tutor & mentor do amazing work to keep me on the right track. My only concern was about the way of describing achievement 2.1 statistical analysis, it needs more examples than context to understand ( i had to open other channels to get it right). Overall, i love the course. Thank you:)",coursereport

While also incredibly exciting and thrilling overcoming all of the challenging obstacles that get thrown your way. What makes getting through those obstacles possible is the incredible and patient help you receive from your Mentor and Tutor. So far on my journey the most beneficial and valuable element is the advice and hands on knowledge I receive from my Mentor and Tutor team.,coursereport

I always feel so much better after chatting with with my tutor or mentor when I get stumped on something. I feel very lucky to get to work with them. It is a breath of fresh air to work with those who are enthusiastic, pleasant, and helpful. The classes are constructed in a great way, I never feel like I am wasting my time. Solo projects can be put into your portfolio and every task is teaching you fundamentals of the industry.

I can't wait to see what the future holds!",coursereport
1071,Careerfoundry,2022-10-14,"The course is comprehensive. It is laid out in a way that helps a newbie like me build a foundation and eventually become a pro with practice and hands-on coursework. The best part is my tutor Leon who goes through your homework in detail. The mentor is also helpful until he left the company mid-way, and I had to start the mentorship with another person. There is a slack support network which is good when I have questions and need help doing research and testing. One thing I would pick on is to allow more leeway and time to finish the course. The course must be finished within a year, but for a first-time working mom like me, it’s impossible to complete it on time. To extend the programme, I must pay a hefty extension fee after I have used up the free extension period. I would appreciate it if the extension fee was not so expensive.",coursereport

I get excited to work on my tasks, submit them and hear back from my tutor with his opinions! I also love that my tutor is in the field I want to go into. He gives me insight to how I will utilize these skills in the real world!",coursereport
1073,Careerfoundry,2022-10-13,"Even though I have already worked with data and developed Power BI dashboards, the course is valuable since visualization is an integral part of the Data Analytics process, but you need to execute other steps, previously and after. · It is appropriate for someone who is not an expert in Excel. A specific module is dedicated to it, and you will learn how to make grouping and summarizations (among other valuable functionalities). · It indeed provides you with the basic concepts of Data Analytics that are the foundation for the next steps in this journey. · I would say it is a practical, self-guided and tutor-supported virtual course that will give you a better understanding of the world of Data Analytics.",coursereport

I started with limited UX knowledge and the lessons started out with very basic (yet helpful) information. Then it gradually dived deep into UX. I never felt lost nor overwhelmed. My tutor is fantastic and provided quick feedback on my assignments. My mentor has provided with some steps I can take to reach my goals as well. Overall, CareerFkubdry has exceeded my expectations.

1080,Careerfoundry,2022-08-18,"I am near graduation in this Bootcamp. Honestly, to say, I am very disappointed. Of course, not everything is too bad, so I will also list the advantages of doing this course. - The curriculum for Data Analyst is well beyond the standard. You do not learn even the basics of Statistics. Regarding learning the core course, they do not focus on teaching you algorithms - essential for learning programming languages, like Python and SQL. You need to teach yourself on another website to learn something properly. If you want to learn SQL and Python, Pandas, for real, you need to get help from other sources. - Another issue is teaching Excel and Tableau. The learning is very superficial, you cannot learn well Excel and Tableau. There is a lack of videos and even descriptive material for you. You need every time to watch youtube for learning something important. I guess there is a lack of videos because they want to save storage space in their cloud server... - Mentors: In a technical aspect they are good - however, one of my mentors seems to lack of understanding technical skills. Despite this, they are not too bad. The only problem regarding mentors is, that you maybe need to wait a lot to let them to answers your messages. I found out that they only answer fast to you when you submit an exercise. If you just write a message to their mailbox, you can wait for about a week to receive an answer. I guess they have an internal indicator regarding this. So every time I need a fast answer, I just post a new answer to an exercise. However, they have advantages: Since they have everything on the internet, you can do this course at your pace. This is a good advantage when you do not have time to be in a Bootcamp (or you can't because you work or you need to attend classes) They also focus a lot on presentations. This in fact their strong point. The feedback regarding the presentations is also good, so I guess their focus on this helps you to communicate your results to stakeholders. However, sometimes they focus too much on convincing you to make PowerPoint presentations and you start to wonder if it is useful for a Data Analyst to make them all the time. I guess this is because they seem to be very strong in UX design courses - it seems to be their core competence - but I guess the person who designed the Data Analytic course does not understand the daily tasks of a Data Analyst course or just understands about UX design. I am saying this because even portfolio examples are only focused on UX design - there are poor portfolio examples as a Data Analyst. Finally, regarding the job preparation course. If you are in Europe, you can have trouble - the focus in doing your resume, for example, are much more regarding a Marketing piece, like the resumes in the USA (and maybe to a startup in Berlin) than the Eu standard. So, if you are in the USA (or Berlin) you won#t have any problem. However, resumes in the EU have their own standards, and this can lead you to be ditched if you have just made a boot camp rather than a Master's or training in informatics (or Math, in the case of Data Analyst) Another problem in the Job preparation course is the lack of training regarding you to answer technical questions. Does everyone know that in such a technical role as a Data Analyst employers question you some technical questions (for Ex. What is descriptive Statistics? what is the variance mean? what is a string? and so on). Since there is a lack of training on this, you need to look on the internet to see questions regarding this matter. Some employers even let you make a test in code (sometimes Excel, Tableau or SQL, Python). Since everyone seems to have a good portfolio on Github and Linkedin, a lot of good companies before hiring you allow you to make a test first. The course does not give you a clue on this. But they focus on you to build your portfolio (even if you do a Data Analytics course) I guess this is because of their focus on UX design. For sure they marketing someone who was hired by a good company, but remember, this can be in another country (not in Germany, for example). Sometimes this person was hired because he already had good technical skills, so just need to remember that. Summing up, I guess you can do this course if: - Do not have time to attend a Bootcamp - you just need to improve your skill in your job - you know the basics of programming and Statistics and math - You finished your Informatics Masters and need to polish your skills - you do not have much money to attend a Bootcamp. - you have no clue on how to advance your career as a Data Analyst, despite having a good technical background - you want to be a UX designer ( I guess they are really strong on this) However, do NOT attend this course if: - You never programmed before - you do not desire to be a UX designer - you lack technical aspects of IT - you do not have good Math or algorithm background - you are not comfortable or good as a storyteller - you need to find a job in the new career fast - you are not confident in Excel or Tableau This is my experience. For sure this is not a too bad course; they just need to update it. If they had more videos on technical topics, I guess this could be an excellent course (better than a lot of boot camps that exist in the world) Remember though, that despite the market is in need of a lot of Data Analysts, the market is saturated with fresher boot campers who know nothing about anything. This can even be a problem in your resume.",coursereport

Although the subject is difficult and requires a lot of study, I feel that through YouTube tutorials I am able to understand better. It is a lot of money that one invests in the program to be constantly requiring external sources to understand the subject matter. I don't think that at the end of this program I will be prepared to find a job with the skills I have gained. At least from my personal experience, this is not the best way for me to understand and learn the subject matter.",coursereport

1086,Careerfoundry,2022-08-15,"CareerFoundry's Full Stack Web Dev course is well thought-out and walks you through understanding and utilizing some of the popular and in-demand technologies. The lessons do need to be updated a slight bit to adjust to the changes in more recent updates to said technologies, but they give you a good feel for each of them regardless. But what I appreciate the most is the amount of support you get from the mentor and tutor they assign to you. If you get stuck, you can always reach out to your tutor for help to get you unstuck. The career assistance is optional, but I would greatly recommend opting in to make the most of what CareerFoundry can give you. You would be given a career advisor and you would walk through some tasks to help you prepare for that job hunt after you're done with the technical learning. All in all, I feel like I have learned a lot more than what I would have if I had studied most of these on my own. I would recommend this course, though I would first get a feel for some of the basics in HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript to get a good start in the course.",coursereport

The course work is laid out in parts as you build your app. Each task leaves you wanting more. Would really recommend CareerFoundary!,coursereport
1094,Careerfoundry,2022-08-15,"The Careerfoundry Full Stack Web Development course has been a pleasure for me so far, I'm less than 2 months away from graduation and I'm glad I chose this school. The way that the course is designed has made the experience very positive for me, the fact that you can go at your own pace and don't need to attend any video classes was very helpful for me as I sometime struggle in a classroom. Instead of video classes you get video calls from your mentor and IM's with your tutor, they almost always answer on time and the Mentor was especially helpful. The course covers a lot of subjects but in a somehow brief manner, you then can choose which subjects you want to improve later on. I haven't started the job preparation course yet so I won't be reviewing it.",coursereport
1095,Careerfoundry,2022-08-15,"CareerFoundry is one of the best decisions I've made in a long time. From course work and the way, my Mentor and Tutor treated and correct my course work inspired me to do better and Job Prep make me feel more and more prepared for the field of UI as I get through the course.",coursereport
1096,Careerfoundry,2022-08-15,"So far, my experience has been great! I would gladly recommend CareerFoundry to anyone who wants to study UX Design. The learning material is thorough and well explained, the community is diverse and I've got great support from my tutor and mentor. I couldn't have asked for more!",coursereport
1097,Careerfoundry,2022-08-15,"During my 5 months online studies, i really like the course material and learned so much. However i think there is a room to improve. Here are some suggestions; - Tutors acting like AI. It’s nice to have them but there is no personal connection. We never have a video call with them. Their reviews feel like standard templates. This made me feel distant my self from the person and i’ve never ask any questions or replied their email. - Sometimes i felt lost during my course, as i didn’t know what i’m gonna do next. I wish there was an intro video in the beginning that explain what tasks i’ll be doing and how they all gonna connect in the end. - I’d like to see more video content.",coursereport
1098,Careerfoundry,2022-08-15,"Nice online course for beginners in the Data Analytics field. Great flexibility, as you can choose when to work on the course, perfect for full time employees.",coursereport
1099,Careerfoundry,2022-08-15,"This course so far has been amazing. I didn’t have high hopes going in, mainly due to my past experience with online courses. Careerfoundry managed to exceed them all. Learning experience is easy, simple and enjoyable. I get constant support from my tutor and mentor and have my questions answered. I’m also very happy for the job preparation course. Have been enjoying it a lot so far",coursereport
1100,Careerfoundry,2022-08-15,"Highly recommend. Thanks to CF I’ll start a new career in a field that I have never heard before. I can work part time, table care of my daughter and study in the meantime. I like it! I’m learning so many new things and I can easily manage my free time. What to say? The best choice",coursereport
1101,Careerfoundry,2022-08-15,I chose CareerFoundry to do my UX design course after analysing many options online and compare the pros and cons. I can say that the course exceed my expectations and the great value comes from the guidance from my tutor and mentor that makes my learning experience 300% much better! I 100% recommend to anyone in doubt!,coursereport
1102,Careerfoundry,2022-08-03,"The CareerFoundry Bootcamp has been a great experience. I succeeded in finding a job as a UX designer 2 months after completing the last course. During the course, I learned a lot about UX Design, UI Design, and UX Research. I still use the course content for my daily business. My instructors have been supportive and experienced but I felt like the personal connection has been missing. My tutor doesn't even answer me anymore. The only downside is the remote setting - you work and study almost completely by yourself. I only talked to my tutor once a week, which can let you feel lonely - depending on the person. Overall, the course was great. Especially the job preparation course has been a huge help.",coursereport
1103,Careerfoundry,2022-07-28,"CareerFoundry was the best online learning experience I've had. The platform was easy to navigate and assisted in being able to focus on the content rather than how to use the classroom. The mentors/tutors I was assigned were great to work with, and always very informative and encouraging. I have, and will continue to, recommend CareerFoundry to friends and colleagues looking to improve their design skillset or make a career change. It has been a life changing experience for me that I am so thankful I took a chance on!",coursereport
1104,Careerfoundry,2022-07-13,"Very informative material with detailed step-by-step instructions in every exercise. I'm switching my career, so such detailed explanations on the material being studied is very important for me. Before enrolling, I've drilled through 10+ online schools and courses, looking for what they offer and CareerFoundry was the winner. Highly recommended to the beginners in data analysis.",coursereport
1105,Careerfoundry,2022-07-13,"I am very happy with the online course, as it is self-paced and there is a lot of information to review and practice. I am also very happy with the assignments. Sometimes I would like to receive quicker or more detailed feedback on my assignments, but on the other hand this gives me the opportunity to look for solutions as I have to do at work.",coursereport
1106,Careerfoundry,2022-07-13,"I was a little skeptical about doing an online course at first. I did a ton of research on what the best approach would be to learn UX before I signed on with Careerfoundry. There's plenty of self-taught paths you can take, multiple online bootcamps, and university courses. It was overwhelming. I found a review for Careerfoundry that really appealed to me though. The course offers a ton of resources to help you succeed. There's job placement assistance, you're assigned a mentor and a tutor, and they have an engaging community of students eager to learn and share ideas that you're encouraged to be a part of. The mentor and tutor components are really what sold me though. I have direct access to professionals in the UX industry which I think is huge in terms of career transitions and helping you prepare for real world UX job scenarios. Overall, I give Careerfoundry 5 out of 5 stars for being the complete package course.",coursereport
1107,Careerfoundry,2022-07-13,"I recently finished the UI Design course with CareerFoundry. I chose it for its practical approach. During this course I was working on several projects, and I am using three of them in my professional portfolio. I also appreciate the support of a mentor and a tutor during the course and the job preparation phase. I would wish for more contact with my peers, the course is fully online and although there is a community of students on slack, it can't fully replace the team experience. Thus, I am currently working on a collaboration project with students I met through the platform.",coursereport
1108,Careerfoundry,2022-07-13,"I am quite satisfied by my experience with Careerfoundry. In my opinion the curriculum is very complete, while also giving you a lot of tips to further learn more about certain topics/tools if wanted. You get a tutor (who reviews your tasks) and a mentor (who reviews your final achievements for each section). The meetings with my mentor were generally very useful, giving me an expert's insight on the topic I was studying/about to study. However, I have to say that the few times I had a specific problem in my code and got stuck it was often difficult to get real, practical help from my tutor or my mentor. I had to ask multiple times until eventually I solved the problem(s) on my own. But then again, that's what coding's all about! Overall, I absolutely would suggest this program!",coursereport
1109,Careerfoundry,2022-07-13,Im more than happy with my experience so far at Career Foundry. It’s a good balance between working on my own and having the support and feedback from my tutor and mentor. I can highlight recommend!,coursereport
1110,Careerfoundry,2022-07-13,"I would recommend CareerFoundry to anyone who is looking to consider a career in the UX field. It will give you an overview and an idea about the field and also will equip you with the skills and knowledge that are required. Among the few things which I want to highlight includes the support from the student advisor community,mentors and tutors and the very active Slack community! Self paced study can get quite overwhelming but CareerFoundry has got your back!",coursereport
1111,Careerfoundry,2022-06-28,"Careerfoundry has a very well thorough & well-paced curriculum. I’ve learned so much in my UX design bootcamp with them already and I am only half way through. My only note, is that this bootcamp is truly a solid foundation for UX knowledge, however, it is super important that you conduct some independent studying as well on top of your CF coursework. Go to meet ups, go to design workshops, socialize with other UXers for the best possible learning experience!",coursereport
1112,Careerfoundry,2022-06-28,"It is my first time doing a course online, and I find the one from Career Foundry very organized. The mentors and tutors are very encouraging and engaging, which I feel is important when you do a course online. What's great is that it is certified and can be paid fully by the Agentur für Arbeit in Germany.",coursereport
1113,Careerfoundry,2022-06-28,"I am doing the UX Design Course as a full-time student and currently about a third of the way of the course. I find the course to be extremely well structured. So far all of the course material has been very well laid out and I had no issues understanding my course content or any of the tasks. The Slack community has been helpful to connect to other students at my level. Most challenging is the pace of the course (as a German student my course is paid for by the government, which comes with a strict deadline) and the complexity of coming up with an original app idea and its structure. It's a great challenge though and I am learning a ton.",coursereport
1114,Careerfoundry,2022-06-28,"I'm a total career changer, so it's not always easy for me, but the CareerFoundry team is there to help and advise.

1115,Careerfoundry,2022-06-27,"I love how each task of this builds upon the previous, it helps to what the entire process of designing is. My tutor is amazing and gives clear and concise feedback, and always gives resources in addition to his critiques . My mentor is so encouraging and helps me know I’m actually progressing. I’m happy I made the investment in this course.",coursereport
1116,Careerfoundry,2022-06-25,"I had a terrible experience with their full stack web development program. There are much better programs out there that are more up to date on their materials and are less expensive. It seems like the only program of theirs that they care about maintaining and supporting is the UX program, but the coding program was unacceptable. Tutors that are either unavailable, don't care, or dont know how to explain coding, projects that are so out of date that all of them have broken within a few months of completing the program, and a program that makes you jump through absolutely ridiculous hoops to try to get a refund, which it doesnt seem like ever happens. This program was advertised to be able to complete in 8 months part-time, which is IMPOSSIBLE unless you have a very very low workload or job that doesnt require a lot from you. They also advertised that they have great tutors and mentor who support you throughout the program....I had 5 differrnt tutors and 3 mentors due to the absolute lack of support from previous ones, and some of them being rude and insulting when you ask for help. This program talks the talk with how supportive and amazing it is, but absolutely does not walk the walk. And the fact that their projects are YEARS out of date is ridiculous. I wish I didn't spend thousands of dollars on this program, as well as be forced to pay $500 per month for extensions due to tutors being unavailable to help, projects being obscenely put of date, and it being near impossible to complete it in the given time frame. Don't waste your time or money!!",coursereport
1117,Careerfoundry,2022-06-20,"The UX Design course fully meets my expectations so far, all is understandable and well structured. The course material is really well structured and understandable and each exercise is always a comfortable length. I really like the tutor and mentor system, I have two direct contacts who answer all my questions and support me on my way. I feel very comfortable with the course.",coursereport
1118,Careerfoundry,2022-06-10,This course is jam packed with new information. I didn't know anything about UI Design before starting this course with CF. As I traditional graphic designer the transition was very smooth and everything is explained really well for beginners. I really liked the feedback and support you get from your Tutors and Mentors.,coursereport
1119,Careerfoundry,2022-06-09,Career foundry has honestly been a big positive change in my life . This program has helped me understand ui design and other aspects of IT and how they all relate!

Overall I've had a great experience with this course; The instructors are friendly helpful. The course schedule is very flexible. The skills I'm learning are very practice. I also want to mention I got a full-time job as a Graphic Designer/UI Designer before I finished the course. One of the interviewer knew of CareerFoundry which I think helped me get the job! I highly Recommend this Program.",coursereport
1122,Careerfoundry,2022-06-08,"I am halfway through the UX Design program and am really enjoying it. I find that it really is a ""you get out what you put in"" type of deal with a great framework. I knew I needed a program that would provide me with a learning structure because self-study was not working for me personally. I think you *can* learn everything here on your own, but it has been very helpful to have a mentor and tutor to guide me in addition to the structured coursework. Overall, I am really happy I enrolled.",coursereport

The way course is set up prepares you got a job search quite well. Its super nice that they mold you into targeting your specific career needs and goals. That helps a lot to be specific and strategic with breaking into the industry. Overall, great way to get the basics and learn the ins n outs. One wish is that it somehow incorporate design programs into the learning process :) otherwise grat school!",coursereport

1126,Careerfoundry,2022-06-08,"I am currently taking a CareerFoundry UX design course. I am happy that we have tutors and mentors who review our work and answer our questions. It’s good that the course provides tasks after each reading material. These tasks helped me learn and progress. However, the reading information isn’t great, and I have to do a lot of extra reading. Sometimes the task doesn’t include the information I need for the task. Also, I think the structure of these tasks could be better; I feel frustrated a lot of the time. I would love to have more examples from designers than they have. ( they provide some examples, but those are so rare, and the project that they showcase changes all the time) * they do great with dealing with student’s issues and giving extra time if you have a good reason.",coursereport
1127,Careerfoundry,2022-06-08,"The course itself is intensive and covers full stack, which is perfect for me. I’m haven’t decided if I want to do full stack, front end or back end and this gives me the chance to cover all my bases. I have come across some communication issues with my tutor and sometimes wonders if he really checks my work, however my mentor has been incredible. I find our Skype meetings extremely productive, motivating and overall helpful. I would recommend this school to friends and family.",coursereport
1128,Careerfoundry,2022-06-08,Course is very clear and straightforward. Mentor and turor are very helpful. A lot of tools for the students to plan and succeed. Very flexible too. But you need Microsoft Office if you don't want to use the Google spreadsheet.,coursereport
1129,Careerfoundry,2022-06-08,I thoroughly enjoyed completing every task throughout the course.

1133,Careerfoundry,2022-05-25,"CF has been a great experience and investment for me so far. I’m about 5 months in, and have found that the curriculum has been direct and relevant and the tasks do a good job of helping you focus on building skills that are most relevant for building a portfolio and starting a job. The availability of a mentor and tutor were big selling points for me, and both have been really helpful. If you’re someone who needs accountability to stay on track or is having a hard time figuring out what to focus on and how to build a portfolio, this is a really great option.",coursereport

There are many options for online courses in UX design and I am so lucky that I found CareerFoundry as it is the best fit for me. Since I have experience with other online courses I could say that CareerFoundry is unique in its ability to maintain engagement and keep you motivated to continue and stay on course. My online tutor and mentor are always there for me and most importantly the student community.

Some of my highlights: I love ¨learning by doing and knowing by experience.¨ My tutor gives valuable feedback that always helps improve my proposals The mentor is experienced in the sector and shares knowledge sync to the job market.

1154,Careerfoundry,2022-04-27,"Intro to UX is a fantastic investment. It provides structure to a broad, evolving career field and makes it easy to gain valuable skills. The course provides a series of lessons and corresponding tasks that help students gain hands-on experience researching and designing an app. While there are some leaps between lessons, the course provides ample resources to help you fill in all the blanks and create something to be proud of. Additionally, their network of tutors and mentors provides invaluable advice every step of the way. I now feel confident in my understanding of how researchers and designers work and I have vital experience to begin my career transition into UX design.",coursereport

The program is well structured providing you with a lot of content and external resources to expand on the topic you are on. It is project based and is designed to take you through the various phases of UCD where each exercise will build upon the previous one to the completion of a final project. Reviews are quite prompted and the tutor and mentor are very available in my experience. (This may vary depending on who is assigned to you). I haven't had any problem learning remotely through their platform, I actually prefer this option over relocating to a new town and live in a Uni Campus (more expensive). Overall, I am happy with it and I do recommend it to others. Hope this helps.",coursereport

1157,Careerfoundry,2022-04-27,"I've been doing the UX Design programme with CareerFoundry for six months and it's been great so far. I'd say their main strength lies on the human factor, as you are assigned a personal tutor, a personal mentor and a personal career mentor that help you develop your skills as you go along with the course content. Additionally, the Student Advisors are always available to help with any questions and are very active promoting additional resources, such as the school's Slack channel, onboarding webinars and so. The course is structured to allow students to keep their own learning pace, so I'd say it would be a good fit for those who need some flexibility on their studies. Overall, I can see I've been learning a lot in these past few months and look forward to the next achievements.",coursereport
1158,Careerfoundry,2022-04-27,"Overall, Career Foundry has been quite an amazing boot camp. It’s project based so you are constantly practicing what you learn from the reading prompts, which helps everything stick in your mind. Additionally, there are no tests or scores- you just keep refining and submitting an assignment until your tutor approves it. Having a mentor who has direct industry experience is probably the most valuable part of Career Foundry. They are able to fill in the learning gaps and teach you how to apply your projects to real world situations. The only reason this course got 4/5 stars is because there isn’t much opportunity for real-world projects. If you want to do something for an actual company, then you have to make those opportunities and connections on your own.",coursereport
1159,Careerfoundry,2022-04-27,"It's a great course. I'm learning a lot - although I would be happy if my tutor and the course materials always said the same thing. The course sometimes doesn't give me the information I need or want. Sometimes information is left out. The way I see it is this: if I have to look at other students' work in order to complete a task, then there's a problem. Looking at other students' work should be optional and it shouldn't have to substitute course material that is not clear or easy to understand. The other problem I've been having so far has been in trying to keep up with deadlines. The course always seems to be ahead of me no matter how hard I try. I wish there was more time to get projects done. I'm happy about the content and what I'm learning though. I don't think I ever would have found the information I'm getting at CareerFoundry if I would have tried to find it by myself. But I think the best thing about it so far has been my tutor. It's great to have somebody who can work with me throughout the whole process and give feedback on my work. I would recommend taking CareerFoundry courses instead of going to college. I've learned more at CareerFoundry in just a few months than in the 3-4 years I went to college for graphic design. Maybe it was just the college I went to - who knows. But that's my advice to anyone who is considering bootcamp or college.",coursereport

I had ZERO prior experience, and so far, CF is a great break into learning programming and the necessary skills to land a job at the end of the course. I was beyond grateful for the help of the student advisors (working with financial aid), course planning, and mentor support. Additionally, the peer Slack community is a fantastic support system for a newbie like me.",coursereport

1162,Careerfoundry,2022-04-27,"CareerFoundry offers an outstanding program in UX Design. I come from a very different background, accustomed to a different way of thinking and working, but the thorough, well-structured and practical curriculum is clear and easy-to follow, making me feel confident every step along the way as I acquire new knowledge and skills as a UX designer. CareerFoundry has devised an exemplary support system to ensure student success. Every student has a dedicated tutor to give assistance, guidance and feedback on coursework, as well as an experienced mentor to provide feedback, insight and context into both coursework and real-life applications of UX. I have been fortunate to have two excellent tutors and two outstanding mentors. (Changes in circumstances led to changes in my tutor and mentor assignments. Although I was reticent to change at first, I soon discovered that CareerFoundry has a large pool of talented and experienced professionals who are dedicated to supporting students along their learning and career path.) I always look forward to video feedback from my tutor and live exchanges with my mentor; they never fail to provide practical feedback, clear and concise explanations, constructive criticism and sincere encouragement. Remote, self-paced learning can bring challenges with it, but CareerFoundry has built a system that optimizes learning and minimizes the sense of distance. With remote work being more and more common since the pandemic hit, it is an added skill to be able to organize one's time independently as well as to communicate and collaborate from a distance. A very user-friendly digital framework offers a dashboard and various communication tools for students to connect with staff, tutors, mentors and one another. The network of students and faculty is international, with participants from all across the globe, which makes for exciting opportunities to make new connections and gain new cultural insights, in addition to the already rich education on offer. I especially value the freedom of the self-paced curriculum. On some days I may feel organized and motivated and on others I struggle with time management. Either way, helpful guidelines in the course dashboard keep me on track. A responsive team is always available to answer questions. It was crucial for me in selecting a course that I be able to fit it into my life, instead of the other way around. The CareerFoundry UX Design Program more than fits the bill.",coursereport

That said, I won't deny that it's a lot of new stuff to learn. I sometimes struggle with the time constraints.

I think my mentor is great and is very supportive and helpful. It is up to you to schedule your calls with the mentor so keep that in mind.

1178,Careerfoundry,2022-03-23,"My background is in theater and teaching and because of the pandemic I began exploring other avenues of work. Friends working in the tech industry suggested I look into UX Design and after reading ""The Design of Everyday Things"" I was hooked. It took a little time to choose (there are a lot of online bootcamps) but Career Foundry had amazing reviews as well as a job guarantee which really sold me on it. I've loved the freedom to remote online learning. If you have the time and patience it's a wonderfully free way to learn. On top of that there are a lot of resources that Career Foundry offers to keep you engaged and not feeling so lonely. These include slack channels, meet ups, and most importantly mentors. My mentor is a working professional in the industry and I've learned so much from our weekly chats. Beyond that the curriculum itself is robust and to the point. The goal is to practice what is preached and not read a thousand articles or listen to hours of lectures. Everyday I feel more and more prepared to speak and practice this new craft I'm learning. The only component missing in the curriculum is group work, I hear about how this job exists in the framework of a team but there's no chance to really feel what it means to work alongside coders, product managers, etc. Lastly, I can't speak to the job assistance because I'm not there yet, but I have high hopes and confidence that Career Foundry will help me go the extra mile.",coursereport

It started with the loss of my grandfather, I couldn’t focus on the course and was given an extension at no charge while I was grieving. Next was my wedding, I was busy planning and grieving at time same time (I was wishing my grandfather could have been there). For the next few months I struggle to remember some of the earlier material. However with the help of my mentor and tutor I was able to get back on track and make good progress. Then came the loss of my dog. I took a few days off for that as I felt with her passing. I was able to get right back into it again with the help of my mentor and tutor. Now most recently I am dealing with the loss of my father. He helped me get started with this course, he paid for it and believed in me. CareerFoundry gave me another extension and now I am very close to finishing. Now I can fulfill my Dads dream of me getting out of the field I’m in and start something better.",coursereport

I started studying at CareerFoundry 3 months ago and so far my experience has been satisfactory. I have a mentor and tutor who are available to give me feedback, plus there's a network of students on Slack who can help you with your assignments, information, and even motivation (there's a really cool Study Buddy program available). I really like the flexibility of the course, which allows me to study without having to affect my work hours.

Definitely something I can recommend to anybody!",coursereport
1191,Careerfoundry,2022-03-10,"I'm nearly halfway through this course, studying full time. So far, the tutor and mentor support has been excellent, with speedy and constructive responses to my coursework submissions (usually within a few hours). I think there is a limit to the number of hours you can book with your mentor, but it's nearly impossible to reach this. I've found the mentor sessions invaluable for understanding how the course content fits into a real-world scenario. Your mentor has a good awareness of the course structure but their job is to be there for your inevitable questions about the industry, UX concepts, job searching, and portfolio development tips. There is also an elective Job Preparation course, which becomes available once you're halfway through your main course. I'm not quite there yet, so can't comment on this. One thing I will say is, with additional reading, there is a lot to cover so good time management is vital for this course. I am aiming to complete the course within 5 months, and currently, I'm on track to do so. It can be hard when tasks require user input (friends/family) as working around their availability can put the brakes on. To get decent results, I suggest you have around 15 people you can reach out to, with about half of those being reliable, go-to people for interviews, and the rest at least prepared to jump on to a 3-minute online survey or digital card sort. CareerFoundry give you a heads up when you have a task that requires user participation but, if you're studying full-time, you might prefer a little more info and sooner so you can prep your friends.",coursereport

I'd like more visual elements to the teaching side, this is a personal opinion as I am ADHD and struggle to read so much online.

1228,Careerfoundry,2022-01-18,"I've just completed a 10-month part-time UX Design course with CareerFoundry and although it's been tough at times, all in all it's been a great learning experience and I'm glad I went through with it! The course itself is well-structured and quite hands-on. It's made up of smaller reading tasks which you have to directly put to practice in an exercise. I found this very engaging and it kept me learning and thinking about UX even when I wasn't working on the course material.",coursereport

1232,Careerfoundry,2022-01-18,"WOW! I have learned so much the last six months, that I don't even know where to start. Getting to know the fundamentals of UX Design through theory and also through practice, I really enjoyed every step of the way. In practice, I have learned how to make a digital prototype of an app idea, what the process is, what tools to use in order to make it, how to organize it and save time and ask for & receive feedback. I enjoyed it very much and am very thankful for the course and the mentor that supported me. Thank you very much! I would recommend it to anyone interested in starting a UX Design career! :-)",coursereport

Every chapter ends with a task which is great because you get to put what you learned in practice. The chapters are easy to understand and follow. The support I get from my mentor, tutor and student advisors is amazing. What I am also looking forward to is the job prep, where they help you find and get ready for a job after the bootcamp which a lot of other bootcamps do not do.

I am nearing the end of the Tableau work (10 exercises) and I feel confident I could make a Tableau dashboard in a professional environment. My mentor and tutor provided have also been great and been readily available for any questions, whether that be the course material or the industry of data analytics itself.

What I like the most about this program is that every single thing that is covered, is linked to a project that I need to create and submit for review. Then I get feedback on my work and anything I need to change or work on in more detail. The only thing I would like to see is more videos embedded in the lessons. Sometimes it is easier for me to watch a video and then repeat the steps because this way I know (visually) where and how I need to do things. When I read things and it is more difficult to translate words to a visual that I need to figure out on the program that we are working on...

I was interested in the CareerFoundry course specifically because you have access to mentorship, and that made all the difference for me. My tutor went above and beyond, and I felt consistently supported by the entire team, program and all of the resources they made available.

My tutor and mentor are both amazing in answering my questions on time, making sure I'm understanding the material and providing other resources to explore. The only issue I've had is that some of the lessons are a little vague in their explanations of concepts. Examples that have been chosen to illustrate certain concepts are oftentimes very different from each other and can be contradictory, so it can be confusing understanding which is the more right way to do things.

At this stage I am progressing through the data immersion exercises, and currently completing the visualization exercise acquiring skills in the use of the Tableau platform. I have found the hands on tasks at the end of each exercise to be helpful for strengthening and retaining skills in each domain; the tasks have been engaging, and most encourage the use of critical thinking skills based on the information learned from the exercise. My tutor has been responsive and encouraging, and has provided further support and resources on the occasion when I may have overlooked or misunderstood something in the exercise. My mentor has been similar supportive and to date has provided detailed feedback pertaining to submissions. The exercises also provide examples of other students work for reference, which has been helpful at times when I have gotten confused with a task.

1292,Careerfoundry,2021-10-15,"I signed up for the Full Stack Web Development program as I already graduated from CF UI Design program with great experiences (though no job in the end). I have to say, although their design program is worth it, the development one is just the opposite. First of all, there is a great distinction in CF team behavior to you depending on if you pay on your own versus if your course is paid by unemployment agency. When I was paying on my own, the team was cordial and I managed to change my mentor with no big explanations. However, now that I am studying through unemployment agency, even though I do not have positive experience with my tutor, all my feedbacks are in vain. Some things that bother me the most: - Complete lack of support. I often lose 2-3 days on one task jsut because my tutor is not availabe during normal working hours. I have to stay logged in until midnight in order to try to communicate to him. He is responding to my chat messages only briefly and often this is not enough to solve the problem. Actually, he has been of zero actual support to me, only giving out links that I can (and do) find myself. Imagine solving one task whole day and then trying to resolve some issues until midnight (because your tutor has better things to do than to tutor you) and even that is not helping because he replies maybe once in an hour!! This means I am sitting endlessly in front of my computer trying to wait for a single reply, which then usually consist of brief sentence with a link to stackoverflow, youtube or whatever!! - Consequence of this total lack of support is that I have to pay for extra tutoring from external people. Yes, that is correct. Because as AfA student, I have no time to waste and I cannot wait 2 days for my tutor to communicate with me, for the tasks I get stuck on I have to pay another person who can tutor me and explain me what is the issue. Yes, you do get mentor calls, but they are LIMITED. You only get 12 calls for the entire course of 50 tasks -and trust me development is hard!! When I asked Student advisors if it is possible to get extra calls, they flatly refused. They do not care about student's opinion at all, when you are not the one who is direclty paying them. - Curriculum is OK and you do learn a lot, but it is expected that you will learn JS from zero to hero in 3 weeks or so, then React in 2 weeks, etc. This is impossible in such a short time, therefore I am paying additional courses on Udemy so I can keep track with the curriculum demands. I found better support on Udemy actually, because when I post some issues there I get sensible and helpful reply from course leader, which is usually not the case with my tutor. - My tutor (again him, yes) is often rejecting my tasks even though I did the same as other students did (as a student you can see 3 approved examples made by other students as a guideline). We all get same tasks and same curriculum. I do not understand why I need to do more than others (for some tasks)!? When I asked my tutor how come I need to do X and Y which other students did not do, his response was that maybe their tutors overlooked this (!?). I have 3 references of same solution, so how can it be possible that 3 tutors made the same overlooking mistake for 3 different people?? - My mentor was initially non-responsive to my messages (would only accept call requests), but he did change his behavior when I pointed this out to him and is now much more helpful. However, I still have only 9 calls left with him and more than half of the course to go, so I know I will not have enough calls with him until the end of the course. Then I guess I will just have to pay to someone else if I get majorly stuck (my progress is watched by the unemployment agency so there is no leeway), which is of course not mentor's fault, it is the limitation of the course itself. In comparison, when I was paying on my own, I think I even unlimited calls with. my mentor (or at least much more than here - but this info I should double-check as I graduated already some time ago from the first course). All in all, while I know that I will make it through this course because I did learn some basic development before on Udemy and some initial knowledge helped me to progress faster in the beginning, I would not recommend this course for Bildungsgutschein students, nor for beginners. Getting feedback as a beginner developer is extremely important because many things can go wrong that are beyong your control (especially when you are facing the topic 1st time in your life) and I am extremely disappointed by how they treat me as a student. And yes, I did send my feedbacks to their Feedback team many times and I also leave review and feedbacks after each lesson (maybe that will help other students if not me).",coursereport

For most of my life, I liked to paint and design, that is why I thought that it would be a great idea to become a UX designer. I had no appropriate skills and decided to join the CareerFoundry UX design course. The course program was very profound, lectures are understandable and my mentor was always ready to help. But in the middle of the course, I realized that it is not the career of my dreams. I realized that I prefer working with people much more than just working with the computer. So I've dropped out, but I the course itself was marvelous. I recommend these guys, if you want to start a new career in UX.",coursereport
1294,Careerfoundry,2021-09-16,"After doing extensive research on finding a program best suited for me, I came across CareerFoundry. The program offers both a tutor and mentor specifically for you, and I love both my tutor and mentor assigned to me. I like that the course lets you go at your own pace but shows you the deadline it should be completed by for each section. The curriculum is in-depth and easy to understand, considering I knew very little about UX Design. I'd absolutely recommend CareerFoundry to beginning and mid-level aspiring UX designers!",coursereport

The curriculum is very well organised, I was skeptical at first when I knew it was online but when I started the course I felt involved in the course more than ever, there's so much to learn and to practice that you don't feel the time pass by and you just want to finish one task and start another. My tutor and mentor are people who you look up to they are always there to help, give advices and guide me through my coding journey. The Student advisors are very welcoming and they always keep contact through encouraging emails. I encourage anyone who is interested in coding to take Full-Stack Web development course at CareerFoundry you won't regret it!",coursereport

It's not only easily accessible and can be done from any corner of the world, but its program is covering if not all, but the most important topics of UI/UX design. I love the way the course is organised and planned. The platform can be tricky sometimes, but it's very well-planned and easy to use, compared to many other online education platforms I've tried before. Daily you have a team of course advisors, mentor and a tutor behind you, ready to help you to solve all your queries. But the most important, I think is the course program and its coverage. You end up getting most important info that will help you in your career. Here everything depends on you, but many of my friends or course buddies ended up landing a job, not even finishing the course first! It tells something about it, right? Check it out for yourself and good luck!",coursereport

My mentor Sam has been so encouraging, I really appreciate his feedback on my achievements (the bigger portions of the project that he reviews). I would highly recommend CareerFoundry to anyone who needs the flexibility of online learning and is unable to attend live discussions. They have a HUGE slack community that is always at the ready to connect and offer support as well. The student services team has been very easy to communicate with about my timeline concerns when I had a family emergency. Overall, I am very happy thus far. I can't wait to finish and go through the job preparation section of the program. I have a good feeling that it will not disappoint.",coursereport

I am happy to know I've made the right decision with my career change, and I am proud to have gotten this far, and I look forward to working as a designer. CF student advisers are responsive, supportive, and thorough. They helped through a difficult time and made me feel confident about moving forward at my own pace. I have yet to start working with my job counselor, however the first meeting went very well. Something that I have been struggling with is my outlook on the support and response from my tutor & mentor. Starting was fine, however further in the course I found that the feedback on my tasks seemed generic, and perhaps copy pasted, as one time my feedback had someone else's name on it. My mentor has been great, however it would be nice if mentors were able to kind of check in with their students, outside of the call. It creates for a little more motivation and confidence, especially for someone like me that is brand new to this field. Overall, great experience so far, perhaps something to consider would be students per mentor and tutor so that they could be more thorough and be able to connect with their students on a more consistent level. Thank you CF, you've given me the opportunity to create a better future for myself, and for that I am very grateful!",coursereport

What I really like, that there is a practical exercise after each theoreticall block, which gives me a better feeling that I am learning by doing and not just from reading the material. What I miss is technical details how to be better in visual design. This I might have to catch up from online tutorials. Regarding my tutor and mentor, they are really helpful, always ready to answer my questions. And they motivate me, which is important when you are a career changer.",coursereport

The guidance, support and patience is immaculate and I am happy with the experiences I make and how good and easy things are going- the texts are insightful, Resources are shared and the Feedback to submitted tasks are also super insightful.

1313,Careerfoundry,2021-08-25,"Very good and detailed course. My tutor and mentor are both amazing. They always have the answers if I get stuck. I cannot comment much on the job assistance as I am not there yet, but I am sure it'll be a great help in the job search so I give it a good rating in advance so I can submit this review. The only thing is as a feedback (not a negative one tho, just a mention) that CareerFoundry says with 20 hours of weekly work students can submit 2 tasks per week with more hours put into the course even more tasks can be submitted. I think it really depends on the past experience of the students. Students from design background may proceed quicker. I don't have a design background so for me it is a bit slower as some tasks take longer, however it is all great all in all, I am almost done with the immersion and my course project is coming together.

But there is a “community page” where you’ll see a whole bunch of students in a bunch of different classes asking for help and giving help as well. It’s honestly not that big of a deal if you’re someone who doesn’t need constant contact when learning. Overall though it’s been fun. I’m only finishing up the intro course so I can’t wait to finish the full immersion course. Also fyi I definitely could’ve finished this month long intro course in about 2 weeks, so if you’re someone who likes to “rush through” these things I recommend as well.",coursereport

I feel however that you course hasn't given me the self-confidence (yet) to be able to write my own codes. As I progressed along the exercises, I was able to understand what the codes do but I don't feel able to write an application by myself. In the beginning I also had problems with mentor/tutor responce time, especially over the weekends.

The course however is aimed towards all people, which is perfect because I get to relearn a few things that might have been in the far back of my mind. I get a refresher every exercise and I learn something new as well. The pace of the course can be as fast as you want it to be, which is great for me because I'm not tied to a desk from 9-5 to do the course. I can easily do it from the comfort of my couch at night or whenever/however I want. They take feedback seriously. You can leave feedback for anything on the course from the exercise to the tutor or mentor you're assigned. There is always someone there to help you. I am doing the course with a Bildungsgutschein via the Agentur für Arbeit in Germany. And CareerFoundry has helped me through every step of the way in order for me to join the course without having to pay anything myself. I'm most excited to build up my portfolio, for which I will get guidance from my mentor and will be able to build from the exercises I'm doing. They also help you with finding a job afterwards and you can prep yourself with the Job Preparation course they provide once you're halfway done with your course.

I'm learning as I am working on a project, it is not just theory, most of the course is about creating your own project. I am learning while creating and while making mistakes, and I think this is the best way. I remember my university days when most of it was studying and taking exams. Here is all about creating a real project. I must say that sometimes can be hard, you have to put a lot of work into it, but it is completely worth it. My tutor and mentor help me a lot, and with all this hard work I feel confident about my project, it'll be something worth putting in my portfolio.

1342,Careerfoundry,2021-07-26,"I moved to Berlin a year and a half ago with 3 years of experience as a UX/UI designer in Ukraine, but this knowledge was not enough to find a job in Berlin. UX is much more important here, so I decided to find a training course to improve my skills. I found out about these courses when several of the guys who interviewed me were taking them. One of them just graduated and got a very good job, even though his only previous experience was in product design (not the IT field). The most frequent question: do you like it? The answer is YES! 🙌🏻 The class consists of theory, a mini quiz, an assignment, and feedback. I have a mentor - takes basic assignments, a mentor - gives feedback on the module, and managers - answer organizational questions. They also added a chat room for 10,000 people [their students and alumni]. A new stream starts every 2 weeks. Generally, taking the course feels like going to work😬 Tasks are full-fledged, not for 5 minutes, but as it is said in the approximate time of 5-6 hours each. There's a full-fledged workout of the skills you need to work as a UX designer. But the most valuable thing here is the feedback. The answer is not only you are good, but they can send you additional articles, point you in the right direction, record a video screen with the task parsing. Anyway, every time I'm excited to get messages ✉️ because they improve the work.",coursereport

My portfolio, resume, and knowledge are beyond what I had hoped for. If someone had told me that I would walk away from this course with the skills, knowledge, and portfolio that I feel that I currently have, I would have signed up much sooner (or maybe just wouldn’t have believed them) The staff is incredibly helpful, patient, and friendly. My mentors and tutors were available, encouraging, motivating, and humble. They all provided an environment where I could ask any question (no matter how ridiculous I thought it may have been) and explained in detail all sorts of real-world situations I may encounter. They were there to support me through any and all frustrations and hiccups and worked hard to keep me on track. My student advisors were always friendly and quick to answer my questions no matter how many I had. At one point I was accidentally given wrong information which put me in a position where I wasn’t going to finish my Job Prep on time. They quickly took responsibility and resolved the issue for me by extending my deadline a week so that I could finish on time. They do a great job keeping you on track.

It's tough, as all self-motivated bootcamp programs, but I want to be prepared with all the foundational knowledge and experience what real-life work projects will involve to feel fully prepared once I start the job search.

They offer great knowledge and with professional UX designers as your tutors and mentor you get detailed feedback and advice currently in the industry. By having a self paced course, I did the online, you can fit it into your schedule as needed and you really get control over your education. I find my talks with my mentor invaluable. Tutors are limited in what they can discuss with you but they have been great as well. You also get other resources and tools to expand your knowledge and portfolio pieces. I also was a fan of the price it's about half other bootcamps and can receive scholarships and is very much worth the value. They have great connections with alumni and companies which are necessary for the workforce. I also liked their job guarantee with salary.",coursereport

They are transparent and list out all the details like fees, duration, start date, and syllabus right on their website. There are no hidden costs or terms and conditions. The course is designed in a way that is easy to understand and has actionable tasks. I have an excellent mentor who is always available to solve my doubts and review my assignments.

From start to (almost in my case!) finish, each advisor, tutor and mentor I’ve been in contact with has been incredibly eager to support me in my career change. Full of enthusiasm and always ready to support you, it makes such a feat a lot less intimidating. As for content: bite-sized break-up of content that is clear, easily-digestible, accessible and comes with a variety of added, optional resources you can always bookmark and return to. I love that you can see samples of tasks as an overview of what’s expected for each submission. And let’s not forget all the webinars, events, opportunities to network! Learning and growing over this time was made a lot more fun than I imagined, starting out. And it was much-appreciated over the past year.

I felt overwhelmed by all the online resources, and this program gave me a sense of orientation and discipline. I like the flexibility of the program as it is impossible for me to attend online classes at a fixed schedule. As well, the tutor that I had was very informative and share with me valuable resources to make my learning easier. The Job prep course was one the best things. In the past I had attended a couple of workshops back at university, but this course has an advisor that is almost a 100% committed to give you feedback and prepare you for the job market(this is not easy to find). Overall, the course doesn't cover all the material there is to learn about analytics, but there are always ways to complement that with what you can find online, so this is not a deal breaker for me. At the end, it was a good decision because I have accomplished close to 70% of the course and I have covered most of the fundamental topics required in a job.",coursereport

1358,Careerfoundry,2021-07-14,"UX Design course at CareerFoundry is probably the most self comprehensive course there is out there in UX design. Out of 4 courses they offer (UX design, UI Design, Data Analytics, and Web Development), UX design is probably the longest. Yes, this is a bootcamp, with all the stigmas that bootcamp have attached to them due to their intensity. Yet, CareerFoundry does a great job at streamlining the learning process in digestible parts, that doesn't make it overwhelming for people with already busy lives. Don't get me wrong, if you want to achieve an outstanding portfolio, you still going to have to put in your grain of salt. But this is not only about the Curriculum, but also about the people who will revise your work along the way. Your tutor, who will review every single exercise, your mentor, who with you have 50 calls booked with, and your Career Specialist, who helps you create your own brand. The support you get is really outstanding. Just one small con about the course, sometimes assignments can take way longer than expected, for designing my prototype for example, I spent well over 30 hours instead of the 9 hours stipulated in the assignment debrief. It would have taken me much less if I had known how to properly use the tool and how to properly use design patterns. My tutor was helpful on this matter, but it wasn't very well explained on the project. On the other hand, my mentor also had different view on the matter, and in the middle of the assignment I ended up confused on what to do next. I managed to fn=finished it just by sticking to my tutors advice since I needed my assignment to be approved by my tutor in order to continue. Other than that, the course is great, as it gives you the solid foundation to start in the industry.",coursereport

As it's new I can totally understand that it needs some refining.

The main pros are: in-depth, self-driven courses, mentorship throughout, you come out with 3-4 case studies under your belt, and an active student/alumni Slack community. One of the best things about the program is they set you up for career success with the optional job preparation course. My career specialist, Neha Hurpaul, was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable in helping me refine my LinkedIn profile, resume, and interviewing skills. With her guidance, I landed a role within a month of graduating. I would recommend the course to anyone looking for a UX/UI bootcamp, and definitely make the most of the job preparation course!",coursereport

Prior to taking the course, I did not feel confident in my full-stack development skills, and now I feel SO much more experienced and have a ton of projects that I can show off!

1371,Careerfoundry,2021-07-01,"CareerFoundry has made me excited to start my journey in UX Design. They give you a timeline of your courses and help you stay on track by showing your curriculum roadmap, which helps me plan my work schedule, family/social life, and course work. The content of information is clear and easy to follow. The examples given throughout the lesson help to get a better idea of the concepts taught. I really like how there are periodic videos of a UX designer practice the task. On top of that, there are approved tasks submitted by other students you can use for reference in helping you complete your own task. CareerFoundry really sets you up for success. My tutor's feedback on each of my exercises submitted have always been timely, encouraging, and helpful. He provides me with additional resources should I want more to further my understanding. My mentor has such a great resume and experience that his advice and tips are valuable notes I keep with me. I would recommend CareerFoundry to anyone who is on the fence of learning UX or comparing bootcamps. I'm so happy I moved forward with joining the program!",coursereport

1374,Careerfoundry,2021-06-15,"I decided to retrain during the pandemic and went with CareerFoundry as their program is very flexible and comprehensive. I needed something I could work on in my own time alongside my full-time job. My background is in Fine Art Print Publishing; even though I had worked with designers for many years, I had very little experience of actually designing myself. The course absolutely exceeded my expectations: in just about 8 months, I learnt an incredible amount and managed to secure my first job as UX/UI Designer within a couple of weeks from graduating. I'll be starting next month and I'm so grateful I picked CareerFoundry. The wide-ranging program is split across 2 main parts: Intro to UI Design (to set you up with all the basic principles), and the UI Immersion program, which gets you really deep into the subject with focus on the creation of an impressive portfolio through hands-on project work. Access to your own tutor and mentor was crucial and excellent. The tutor is on hand for the day-to-day tasks, and the mentor reviews your final projects. You can book regular calls with them to discuss anything from the projects you're working on, the industry, technical tips or just when you're in need for a motivational boost. Those calls were so useful and really helped guide me through it all as the program can be overwhelming at times, they certainly throw a lot at you. But I always felt very supported throughout. As well as these 2 main parts, you get to pick a Specialisation course with a choice between Animation, Frontend Development or Voice Interaction. I went with Frontend Development as I felt it would set me up as a more 'rounded' designer to understand a little more about that side of things. I noticed many job ads for UX/UI Designers here in the UK required some knowledge of frontend so I went for it. This course was a real challenge for me as I had no prior experience of coding, but again, the mentor was instrumental in getting me through it. The content was overwhelming at times as there is a lot to cover in a short 6-8 weeks course. Having said that, it was truly rewarding to complete it. I may not be a coder, but the skills I acquired with this part of the course made me more credible when it came to talking about my process as a designer when facing the Director of Development for my second interview. On top of all this, you also get access to the Job Preparation course which is absolutely brilliant. This course gives you all the tools you need to tackle the job market with plenty of confidence. By the end of it, your CV is exemplary, your portfolio is polished, your interview technique is convincing and you know how to write a striking cover letter. You also get access to the career specialist for another 6 months after you graduate so you can get all the support you need as you start to actively seek your first position. I feel this part of the course was instrumental in making me a strong candidate when applying for jobs, it gave me all the confidence and tips I needed to really stand out from the pack. Of course things were difficult at times, and it's certainly a commitment. You have to keep motivated but the CareerFoundry platform gives you access to great resources with a brilliant and proactive Slack community where you can get plenty of technical tips, industry advice as well as fantastic networking and career leads. I couldn't recommend this course enough, I'm delighted I took the plunge.",coursereport
1375,Careerfoundry,2021-06-15,"One of the best online training I've done in web development. It is certainly not easy and there were many challenges, but with patience, with the help of the support team, my tutor, and of course my mentor, these challenges can be overcome. I would definitely recommend this course to budding web developers who want to learn flexibly and remotely.",coursereport
1376,Careerfoundry,2021-06-15,"I like the curriculum and the support system (mentor tutor and job advice) , however I wish I could have some. More personal interaction with my tutor, e few face to face communication per video call instead of simply writing with them.",coursereport

It is organised and run incredibly well, enabling me to focus all my attention on the exercises and guidance of my tutors and mentors. I feel that I am being consistently challenged within a highly supportive structure, which provides me with the confidence that I will be more than prepared to take on proper work when the time comes.",coursereport
1378,Careerfoundry,2021-06-14,"I'm taking the UX Design course and so far it's been really great! It's been almost three months since I started the program. I'm a career switcher, been in my current career for about 5 years, and UX is an entirely new career for me. Naturally I was very hesitant to sign up due to the risk, the new beginning, the unknown, as well as the cost of the bootcamp. Although other UX bootcamps are much pricier (over 10G!), the cost at CF was still a factor for me. After much much research on my end and speaking with a CF rep, who answered all my questions before being sure I wanted to get started, I decided to take the leap. The job guarantee or your money back, as well as the opportunity to try the bootcamp for 14 days to decide if I wanted to pursue it, were ultimately what helped me solidify my decision. I'm so happy I signed up for CF and I've learned so much thus far. I will say that if cost is a factor for you as well, and you're good at teaching yourself, there are so many free resources out there and it is not necessary to take a formal class/bootcamp. However, I tried that at first, and if you're like me and need the structure of a curriculum and guidance of a tutor/mentor to be sure you're on the right track, then you may find CF to be very valuable, as I have found it to be. The flexibility of the program has also been really great, as I'm still working full-time while balancing CF and other responsibilities. Although this has not been easy to do, I know it is worth it. I rated the instructors a 3, since there are no instructors, but I was unable to move forward with the review without rating it. I also have not yet started the job assistance portion, so I cannot yet speak on that, but I'm very much looking forward to that part. Feel free to click on the link below to get a discount for your CF program. Might as well take the plunge to sign up and get a discount doing it. :) https://careerfoundry.com/en/referral_registrations/new?referral=B7LAlNr3 Good luck!",coursereport

Thanks to them to give me such an amazing opportunity for my career change",coursereport
1381,Careerfoundry,2021-06-14,"I am currently studying at CareerFoundry. Or rather, I am currently in the process of foundry to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. I think the name they chose makes a lot of sense: they take students as if they were raw materials, and mold them through technical knowledge and soft skills to finally produce a professional ready for the job market. Or at least that's what I'm seeing (and of course, what I'm hoping for). I'll be honest: nothing is perfect. Never trust people who say something is perfect. Even the best university in the world isn't perfect. You will always find something that can be improved: the infrastructure, the study curriculum, the job connections, the way tests are taken, and so on. However, it is always good to make a balance, and in this case in CareerFoundry the good aspects win. First I will start with the only moderately bad point that I find in CareerFoundry, and that is totally correctable: the course content. The course is divided into achievements. The good thing? To approve each achievement you have to create a web page / web app that you can add to your portfolio and increase your chances of finding a job. The bad thing? There are a couple of poorly explained achievements, outdated (by almost 2 years) and in urgent need of revision and correction. The course curriculum is very interesting, and I think it allows students to have a solid foundation to go out to the labor market. That's why I say it's a moderately bad side: the study curriculum is great, the projects are wonderful, but in some achievements it's really an odyssey to understand what they ask for (punctually, the achievement 3 that builds the foundations of React). Don't get me wrong: as programmers we must be prepared to be constantly learning and updating our knowledge. However, it is a bit tiring to have to make use of materials or tutorials outside the course to understand how to do well the requested project, since the contents are a bit outdated or unclear. At this point, I think CareerFoundry focuses more on UI and UX courses, and web programming is perhaps in second place. UI and UX design are its strong points, of course, but I think it should not forget the web programming course. It would be interesting if every year the curriculum is reviewed and updated. Two years of lag is quite a lot. By the way, a strong point: students can access in lecture mode to the other courses offered. I asked for access to UI and UX. I won't have a certificate, but I will be able to get the knowledge from those courses without paying extra. Wonderful! A bonus point for the foundry. Now, the whole resume thing takes a back seat when it comes time to communicate with your tutor and mentor. That's CareerFoundry's strong point, and where I'll start talking about the positives it has. At the beginning of the course you are matched with a tutor and mentor. The tutor will correct each assignment that comes with each chapter of an achievement, and the mentor will correct the final project of the achievement. He or she will make a video, pointing out the strengths and weaknesses of your work. The tutors and mentors are professionals who have a lot of experience, and the feedback is great. And now maybe I should be honest and expose a personal appreciation. I have been lucky, and probably have the best mentor a web programming student could have. And that is that my mentor not only helps me to perfect my skills with his corrections of my projects, but also encourages me to be better. In CareerFoundry you can schedule video calls with the mentors (I think there are about 12, I can't remember), and I must say that those video calls have helped me a lot. My mentor, a great professional from Vietnam, has given me tips to be a better programmer, he shows me my failures and how I can improve, he encourages me when I have the impostor syndrome and makes me see the good things I have. He lives up to his name: a mentor. He inspires me to be a good programmer and to have hope that, once I finish the course, I will be able to find a job as a web programmer. By the way, another great thing about CareerFoundry is their job guarantee. If you take the job readiness course with them (which is totally optional), you can access the job guarantee: if you don't get a job within the first 6 months after finishing the course, you get your money back. Sounds great, doesn't it? However, I don't know if anyone has made use of that guarantee so far. The job preparation course is great: they help you perfect your CV, have a presence on work social networks like LinkedIn, and more. By the way, you are also matched with a mentor. My mentor is great, and the video calls have been really helpful in gaining confidence and improving my job search techniques. I think I will be well trained to give good interviews once I finish the course. Regarding the price of the course, I cannot say anything about it, because thanks to the AFA I was able to do the course at no cost. It is a great help that you can receive if you live in Germany: a Bildungsgutschein from the Agentur für Arbeit. CareerFoundry is a German Bootcamp, so if you receive a Bildungsgutschein I recommend that you take your course with them, especially if you plan to develop your career in the German job market. In Germany CareerFoundry is quite well known. Regarding money, I must be honest. Especially because I am a person of solid ethical principles. And I do not know if this message will be removed from this page, since what I will say may go against everything that is usually written here. Do you want to be a web programmer, but are you poor? Don't you have the financial means to pay for a Bootcamp? Keep calm, I understand you. I come from Latin America, I know how difficult it is to access education. In addition, unfortunately the prices of the Bootcamp are designed for the reality of the first world. However, don't lose hope: you can do it, you just need to stay motivated and get organized. Based on my humble experience, I give you two options. The first. You're poor? Learn programming through programming tutorials on YouTube, reading the official documentation of the technologies you should learn, creating projects and sharing them on GitHub, actively participating in Stack Overflow. However, do you need certificates to demonstrate what you have learned? In freecodecamp you can get them. The Bootcamp of the poor. And believe me, it has nothing to envy from the curriculum of other Bootcamps: it is the same or probably the best of all that exist, because it is constantly updated and has a whole community behind support. I know it is dangerous to say it, but I must take a risk because I know that not everyone has the means to pay for a Bootcamp. The second option: you are poor, but you can save a little money each month to pay for a bootcamp. If so, take the web programming course with CareerFoundry. Or what the heck, with some other bootcamp that is cheaper or also has a fair job guarantee. The important thing is that you get out of poverty and can have a decent salary to live a decent life. The only thing that differentiates a paid bootcamp like CareerFoundry (and all the others you can find on this page), from a free bootcamp like freecodecamp, is the mentors and tutors guide. You will be able to receive feedback and, most valuable, advice to be able to enter the labor market quickly and well. Do you live in the first world, and do you have financial means that allow you to do a paid bootcamp to learn web development? Well, I recommend CareerFoundry. I can't tell you if it's better or worse than the others, since it's my first time doing a bootcamp. I can just tell you it's worth it, for the mentors, tutors, job guarantee, job prep course, and portfolio projects. I hope to be a little help. I'll update this by finishing the course, and of course when I find work as a web developer. Happy coding!",coursereport

From here you get immersed in the world of interface design, guided by a tutor and industry professional (mentor). Towards the end of the course you are then asked to choose a specialisation, which where I'm nearly at right now! You can choose from different options, including animation and developing. I've really enjoyed the course so far, and most importantly, it has been very challenging (it would be odd if it were too easy!). All the people at CareerFoundry are really friendly and they really keep you on your toes and check-in on you regularly to see how you're doing. The main benefit of the course, apart from the written content, is the tutor and mentor focussed learning. You get access to people who really are pros in the industry and they will properly and honestly help you with your work. You also get career guidance and support from a specialist, which is where I'm at at the moment, and again they are really helpful and friendly. So far so good for me! It is a lot of work, and you will have to put the time in, but I do feel as though I'm getting somewhere. I suppose it's also worth adding that I'm a complete new-starter to design!",coursereport

You get a Mentor who reviews your projects (and you can book weekly video calls), and a tutor who reviews your daily tasks. The latter unfortunately doesn’t leave much comments on your exercises and just makes sure you stick to the task given, which sometimes makes you re-do lots of stuff at the end if the project, when you mentor finally reviews it.",coursereport

1389,Careerfoundry,2021-06-11,"I chose CareerFoundry due to its balance of cost/program length/provided resources and I must say that I think it has been a great value so far. But like most things, you get out what you put in. Obviously due to its nature as a bootcamp it is somewhat limited in scope, but where this program shines is in it’s provided mentoring. I see the provided readings/exercises as a great starting point, then delve deeper with my mentor to really understand real world applications of my new knowledge. I truly recommend taking full advantage of the numerous (99) mentor calls provided with the course. I speak with my mentor every week, he’s very knowledgeable and I can tell that he’s eager to help me learn and grow. I’m about 2/3 of the way through my immersion course and am honestly engaged with the app I’ve been building through the course. am looking forward to the specialization course that will follow and plan to make full use of the Job Prep course as well. (I’ve left job assistance neutral at 3stars as I haven’t reached that point yet)",coursereport
1390,Careerfoundry,2021-06-11,"To anybody that is looking to change their career or go down the UX Design road, I would highly recommend CareerFoundry. From start to finish I have been supported throughout my course. Although I am at the early stage of my UX career, I feel very confident that the skills that I have learned, are to a very good standard in this industry. The material provided was easy to follow and there was plenty of reference material. And if that was not enough, there are tutors, mentors, advisors, a slack community and other students that were willing to help at the drop of a hat. All in all, a fabulous experience with an organisation that is well structured. I do have one request and this probably applies to all! It would be great to see how accessibility is applied to design at the very early stages of the design thinking process. We are all aware of the lack of accessibility in today´s society and courses like this and any other, are creating the designers of the future. It is imperitive that change is made by designers, businesses believe there are too many challenges, designers will provide the solutions, rant over :-) Wish you guys all the best and will certainly be looking at other courses in the near future.

I have been in and out of college for the better part of a decade and it just never stuck for me. I really thought something was wrong with me and that I would never be able to vamp up my resume or be taken seriously. CareerFoundry has the perfect approuch for people who learn best with hands on assingments and diving into projects where you are taking away so much more than any classroom enviroment would offer. My self esteem is the highest its ever been and I feel confident CareerFoundry is giving me all the things I never thought I would have.

1395,Careerfoundry,2021-06-11,"Just recently I graduated from CFs UX Design course and found myself surprisingly melancholic when it ended. My experience at CF was challenging. Learning independently became a struggle around 60% of the course. The openness my tutor, mentor and everyone in the many slack channels showed, encouraged me to share my fears, recieve help and get through the toughest moments. The work needs to be done well, there is no way around it when learning a new craft. Yet, the environment can influence the progress a great deal. At CF I felt in good hands and inspired to not just do well but thrive and give it my best. This gentle push and being held accountable shaped the perspective on my new career immensely.

I'm currently taking the UX design course and I'm highly impressed with how organized their curriculum is. It was also designed to keep you on track. After every lesson, you are assigned a task that is reviewed by your mentor who in return gives you generous feedback. Trust me their feedback is NOT generic. You really get valuable feedback that tests your understanding of the lessons. Now, what I love most is that have weekly video calls with your mentor and from there you can get immediate feedback on anything you are struggling with. Again, this is one of the BEST online courses I've taken so far and definitely worth the money.",coursereport

It has been a great user experience in my study since the course is well organised, and all information is carefully represented. I never felt lost, which unfortunately happened to me when I took another online course from a different school. I like my tutor and mentor and its system. They encourage me a lot and give me helpful insight to improve my design. I'm not a native English speaker, and I was worried about my English skill fo the beginning. But once I get used to reading a lot (most of the course materials are written base), I feel more comfortable and enjoy it a lot. Maybe I'm just an old school person, though. If you prefer video materials, maybe you should look for something different. Lastly, just one thing, I had a slight problem with the different version of the application (Sketch). The interface design was different from the course material, and I got stuck there. I asked the tutor, but it seems that he didn't know about it. Except for that, everything is great so far, and I'm looking forward to working on future projects and complete the course.",coursereport

UX design was something that had always fascinated me, but I had never pictured myself in the tech world. Unhappy and stuck, I did lots of research and CareerFoundry seemed to be the best option to take the leap into this new world. The course is clearly structured, the more you put in in terms of work, the more you get back. Sometimes it's not easy, but the support system you have through your mentor and tutor is invaluable. I would do it all again, I love the course material and the fact that it's hands on practice, not just theory. Highly, highly recommend!",coursereport
1411,Careerfoundry,2021-06-02,"I am reviewing the experience I am having so far at the CareerFoundry Bootcamp, UX Design, full time. So far I have mixed feelings since I hoped that I will never have to change the tutor or the mentor, but exactly that was the case. Starting from reviewing the beginning, the Intro course, I felt like it was a bit overwhelming, the tasks and the deadline. It feels like you get thrown in the cold water but in the end if you are focused and dedicated enough, it is doable. It is such a pity though that at some points you tend to ""just get the task done in time"" instead of taking your time to study all the given content and also have a look at all the additional resources offered. Also in the first weeks, due to the time pressure, it is difficult to connect with fellow students. All these aspects get better as soon as I started with the immersion course. You get used to the pace. For the samples given at the end of each exercise, that shall show you how other students did that particular tasks, it happens to find examples that are not correct, therefore misleading, at least this is the impression I got quite a few times when confronting the tasks with the categories of the requirements. I am by no means qualified to evaluate the examples shown, but sometimes you can really see that something is missing or clearly not as required. This is confusing when you want to refer to them as well done examples. As for the change of tutor, one day I just got an email from the support team telling me about the change after there was an issue with the tutor, but the email was very vague, and I didn't expect that, nor I had the chance to discuss that with the tutor itself. So, i was left there with a new tutor and without knowing if the first tutor decided not to follow me anymore and what I maybe did wrong. Respecting everybody's privacy is crucial, but that could have been handled differently. I just started the 3. achievement recently so for now, I have no further feedback.",coursereport
1412,Careerfoundry,2021-06-02,"As the title reads, so far so good! I enjoy each exercise, even when I’m a little stressed! I feel challenged in a healthy way and I’m learning so much. My Tutor/Mentor are great and everyone is super friendly and the responses are fast and helpful. I would only update the Sketch “explanations” considering that they belong to an older version.

1413,Careerfoundry,2021-06-01,"I am part way through the UX Design Program with CareerFoundry. The structure of the course is great. In the first month, you do an ""Intro to UX Design"": a top-level exploration of everything you're going to learn in the course. You get to develop user interviews, user personas, build wireframes, interactive prototypes, testing etc. But it's not until the immersion part of the course that you dig deeper into each area, and consolidate your learning. This program presents all information in an easy to understand way. There is written text, example videos, additional readings, exercises, quizzes - but most importantly - fantastic mentors and tutors. While you need a lot of self-discipline to complete the work - my mentor has been so motivating, helpful and just generally great to talk to. We have regular video calls, and I always feel inspired afterwards (and clearer about what I'm supposed to be doing). I find it challenging to get through the work - but it is so interesting, and I feel like CareerFoundry could not be more supportive in helping you achieve your goals. The Slack community is also excellent - I have learnt so much from current and past graduates - and it's a great way to network. Would definitely recommend this course to others.",coursereport

From the beginning on, the support and provided assistance during the application and during the course has been just awesome! The course itself is very well structured and CF definitely figured out the good way between the theory and practical parts. The theory is kept rather on the shorter side - readings are between 20-40 minutes (not included the optional resources). They stress on practical parts (tasks) and this is where I see the huge benefit of doing it that way - in 4 months I could not only learn fundamental things about UX but also build my practical skills while working on a course project. Tutors and mentors are crucial to stay on track, get help, and insides on the real-life as UX Designer - I got really amazing tutor and mentor who have been assisting me with all my questions etc. The tone is super friendly and engaging. I really appreciate that. Furthermore, students are able to network with other students, graduates, and professionals via slack, FB group, and Linkedin.

I really have loved the structure of the lesson plans, and the quizzes and tasks that follow them. Really enjoy that I not only get to digest the information but apply it to projects that will be showcased in my portfolio at the end. The mentors are all very knowledgeable, but I did have one that was not a match for me which my advisor was quick to place me with a new one. My tutor is always accessible when I have a question, and gives great feedback on every task I submit. The online atmosphere is supportive and very conducive to help you achieve success throughout.

I also like that they explain UX concepts in great detail, and break down tasks into more manageable chunks. The tutor and mentor support is also very important and I found it helpful that each student gets one-on-one support. The Job Prep course is also fantastic, as it helps you build a resume and portfolio. One way that I think CareerFoundry could improve is by providing more guidance in learning specific programs...for example a student may be required to complete a task using Adobe XD or Figma, but it is often up to the student to figure out/teach themselves how to use that program, which can be frustrating and time-consuming.",coursereport

The materials were very superficial and disconnected from real work in the industry. I would have liked to learn about decision making strategies in design, not basic facts like ""your font size should be legible"". The tutors and mentors focused more on being ""encouraging"" than helping me improve, and their feedback was often just copy-pasted and completely off-topic. Even after requesting it several times, I didn't receive constructive feedback. CareerFoundry's support system was among the worst customer service systems I have ever come across, so even though I did the course in a relative short amount of time, it took forever for requests to get processed.

1448,Careerfoundry,2021-05-19,I love how the program is self paced and project based. My tutor is always available to help and is very speedy with replies. The job prep course is amazing as well. Everyone is super supportive and helpful!,coursereport
1449,Careerfoundry,2021-05-18,"More than what I learned about UX design, the 'meat' of this program relies on their career resources. They really guide you to transfer your skills and be prepared when you graduate to find a job.",coursereport
1450,Careerfoundry,2021-05-06,Great online course that teaches you everything you need to know going into the UX/UI Design field without having to apply to a university. They assign you mentors and tutors that you can talk to virtually and they are very helpful.,coursereport
1451,Careerfoundry,2021-05-06,"I really like how the whole learning platform is set up. I think you get a great insight into the job and process of a real project and the flexibility of the schedule is great. I would recommend CareerFoundry to everybody who is looking for a career change. However, I think that some of the tutors are not as skilled as I would expect them to be and their schedule might be too tight to get feedback in a reasonable amount of time. I think within 24 hours seems to be okay on paper, but if you are struggling with a specific task and you cannot proceed for the next 24 hours this can be challenging and really put you off schedule. But the mentors and student advisors are great and the overall experience as well.",coursereport
1452,Careerfoundry,2021-05-05,"Coming from cultural projects management, UX design seems like a drastic change (and surely is one). It was very important for me to find the right bootcamp, a training that would give me time to ingest all this new knowledge and push me to stay on track and motivated. After comparing a variety of online courses, I opted for CareerFoundry. Why this choice? Well, first of all it had great reviews from former students on sites such as Course Report. And second of all, everyone I had the chance to get in touch with was absolutely lovely. You can see right up that these people really care about you, your path and your projects. The Program Advisor I talked to prior to registering took the time to answer all my questions, and then sent me the documentation and further information by email. I had trouble with my bank regarding the payment of the fees (something to do with the bank transfer), and CareerFoundry stood by me while I was tackling it, offering multiple solutions to help me. So from the beginning, I knew I was going to be well looked after. And guess what, this only got better when I actually started the training! The course material is very accessible, even to someone who doesn't have a previous training in IT. The fact that it's a hands-on training is invaluable, because you can see your project grow as you grow along as a UX designer. You are paired with a tutor and a mentor, both very accessible, who are here to guide, inform, help and congratulate you. The student advisor team checks in regularly to see how you're doing. You get a dedicated Career Specialist to help you get job-ready by the time you're done with the course. And the icing on the cake is really all the online events CareerFoundry offers to its students: webinars about UX writing, networking, portfolio creation, and so on and so on. Not to forget the great community of students, readily available on dedicated Slack channels! To sum it up, choosing this course was probably one of the best choices of my life. The people are lovely, the course is accessible, I get the feeling that I'm definitely growing and learning. Even though I can't wait to begin my new career as a UX designer, I think I'll shed a tear when this training is over...!",coursereport
1453,Careerfoundry,2021-05-05,"I am undertaking for around 6 months now the course offered from Career Foundry on Ux Design. The process of learning is very well structured, with high quality material to read through and practice upon. The unique and exciting part is that u get to practice through the development of your own projects throughout the course. A bit plus for me is the fact that u get also to interact with ur designated mentor and tutors. Both have been extremely helpful to me, very nice professionals and make the best i can just from learning by their experiences.",coursereport

1456,Careerfoundry,2021-05-03,"I’m really glad I enrolled in the UX Design program. I came across UX Design two years ago and the more I was reading about it, the more I wanted to know about it. However, design is not only about reading, exploring theory, it’s mostly learning how to apply it. I realized that without having a structured way of learning and mentorship to get feedback, it would be very difficult to advance, especially while working full time. I really appreciate the mentors and tutors that I had and the prompt, honest and encouraging feedback that I received. CF staff members are also very welcoming and friendly, quickly answering all the questions. UX Design is a broad domain and there will always be something to learn, this course will give you the methods and tools to start and then dive deeper. I recommend it especially to career changers as it comes also with a Job Preparation module, which I find very useful.",coursereport
1457,Careerfoundry,2021-04-30,"The UX Design course through Career Foundry is everything I wanted! My tutor and mentor are there for me every step of the way. I have been building my portfolio to be able to land a design job, and with their job in 6 months or tuition back guarantee, I know they will work with me every step of the way to help me move into my career and land that first job. I have been so impressed at how clear and simple they have been able to describe everything, especially since I have no background in design. I would highly recommend this course to someone that like to work at their own pace. With my little kids at home, I have been able to be flexible with my school schedule and respect my family life.",coursereport
1458,Careerfoundry,2021-04-29,"I began to learn UX Immersion course with Careerfoundry in August 2020. I got surprised by the quality of the course first with exercises to put into practice all that I have been learning throughout the process. I'm very happy to have a mentor with whom I can get Visio call very often and who can answer any questions that I have. I'm also very happy to have a tutor who takes care of my homework for each exercise. Now I'm at the last 2 achievements of the course, I'm pretty confident to say that I've learned useful knowledge and gained experiences in UX design. I have a job preparation course in parallel after I finished half of the UX Immersion course and I'll have another 2 specialization courses after this course. I've been surrounded by a caring team and very professional people. I'm very satisfied. Thanks to the Careerfoundry team.",coursereport
1459,Careerfoundry,2021-04-29,"CareerFoundry is a great Bootcamp for students that have no background in design. However, I feel that sometimes it is pretty lonely and the course should allow for more interaction between students and instructors. Overall, great experience.",coursereport
1460,Careerfoundry,2021-04-29,"I’ve passed the first half course to of CUX. Each learning is valuable and assignments are supported by friendly and helpful teachers. It held me to keep my motivation high and I can see myself growing. The way I think and see any software/application has changed. I also improved to explain my design decisions and teachers always give me valuable feedbacks. Moreover, when I need a general support, staffs are responsive and helpful. Thanks to CF’s simple and helpful journey, I can be laid back and concentrate my goal to be UX designer :)",coursereport

The team at CareerFoundry is always helpful and you'll get lots of support and guidance. One thing I want to say about the UI course is that it needs a lot of effort from your side. Be prepared to work a lot, this is part of the whole learning process. Have fun and good luck!",coursereport

1463,Careerfoundry,2021-04-26,"I took this course in Feb and really enjoyed it. Coming from a complete novice, not very technical background I really liked how efficient the course was, enabling you to start creating real websites and features from the very start. Instead of spending ages going through a slow introduction and the theoretics of everything, Career Foundry's short course leads to you creating a tangible product to show off after a few days. If you want to go back and learn more about the pieces behind each step instead of just following the instructor, the step-by-step text under the video really helped with my understanding. I liked that the instructor was natural with their typing and didn't go too fast, teaching us good habits about going back to check your code to fix it when things aren't displaying properly. I also liked that instead of just the bare minimum, they teach you features like Mobile Responsive in CSS, something that it's not obvious to include but really important if you want to work as a web developer with a client. I'm going to go back over the course in a while to refresh my memory again, then decide which area I want to focus on first.",coursereport
1464,Careerfoundry,2021-04-25,"UI ProgramThe UI Immersion is 5 months at 30 hrs/week or up to 9 months at 15 hrs/week. I utilized all of the 9 months, and CF kindly added an extra month at no cost due to the pandemic. The additional time helped me complete my design portfolio! At the bottom of every task are student examples that are helpful references. Note: the courses require hard work and commitment. Ultimately, it is the student who needs to make it all happen, but with the help from the tutor & mentors. UI Immersion Support Each student is paired up with both a tutor, who reviews the tasks, and a mentor that reviews the final task at the end of each achievement. I noticed some students received better support from their tutors and/or mentors than others. I wish I pushed harder (past the resistance) to change my tutor, which was the only negative experience. Luckily the second mentor I changed to was a better match to my needs when it came to providing detailed feedback. Career prep Halfway through the program, students can opt in for the job preparation course. Similar to the immersion, a career specialist is assigned to provide guidance and support. Every Wednesday, students can also attend the Office Hours to get even more answers to burning questions and even get feedback on their resume, portfolio, and Linkedin profile! My career specialist was filled with positive energy and attitude. She helped pull out my confidence and sincerely believed in me. This portion of the course was extremely helpful and truly valuable!",coursereport
1465,Careerfoundry,2021-04-21,"I finished the data immersion course with CF. It was a very straightforward, chug and plug kind of Bootcamp. From 1-10 difficulty i would grade this an 8 as there are some challenging statistic concepts and much coding. The hardest part about it was not getting enough support from tutoring in a timely manner. You have one tutor for the entirety of your course, the challenge is to get your schedules to match up so that the courses can be graded on a timely manner. Reaching the tutor proved quite a challenge specially during holidays.",coursereport
1466,Careerfoundry,2021-04-21,"Overall, I have had a positive experience with Career Foundry. I am currently in their Data Analyst program. I’ve been learning lots of new skills and my tutor/mentor have been very helpful and encouraging. The lessons are interesting and the tasks have been challenging. In this course, you work with real data from several different industries and the programs covered are Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Python. My only criticisms are that there have been some minor mistakes in the lessons and sometimes it takes longer than I would like to get in touch with my teachers. That said, CareerFoundry has always been accommodating with extra time to finish my course when there were technical problems out of my control. I haven’t begun my job search yet, so I can’t speak to that part of the program. That said, I’ve looked over the curriculum for the Job Preparation part of the course and it is very thorough!",coursereport
1467,Careerfoundry,2021-04-21,"I believe that the curriculum has some issues which I hope are going to be solved in the future. My main concerns are i) the estimations of learning are highly unrealistic ii) the content of the modules are not well organised. Nevertheless, I feel so grateful of my mentor and the help I receive.",coursereport
1468,Careerfoundry,2021-04-21,"What stood out to me the most is the excellent quality of mentorship that CareerFoundry provides to all its learners remotely. For someone transitioning mid-career such as myself, it was a boon to finally have a dedicated expert show me how to do things in a certain way. The 'what' is easy to figure out by reading information in books/blogs etc., but the approach, the technique, the hacks and the mindset need to be inculcated. CareerFoundry's systematic, mentorship-driven curricula instills that kind of discipline in you inspiring you to push your own boundaries.",coursereport
1469,Careerfoundry,2021-04-20,"Well, to be honest, this was a terrifyingly inept program. I have to say that some of the mentors and advisors were helpful, but it was clear that this is simply a business and there is no quality control of the student work being produced. There is no standard to educate folks that have no design background with the tools they will need. They are simply setting their students up to fail. I landed on my feet because I have the training and skill set. Most people do not. This was incredibly disappointing.",coursereport
1470,Careerfoundry,2021-04-16,"This design course was a fantastic experience! I'm a graphic design student with only my associates, but I opted to go with CareerFoundry rather than taking more classes for a bachelor's. I felt I could gain more experience in a shorter time for a lower cost. With that being said, here's my experience in detail: 1. The Information - To let you know right out the gate, it's a good amount of reading, and your experience will only be enhanced if you read the multitude of links and resources they provide. The information itself is a solid way to understand your design app, and the overall design process. It also helps to give insights on what you will be doing in the workplace which is a nice addition. I will say that aside from a couple of times, they never get too detailed on their topics. Each task will have you jumping around from topic to topic trying to learn everything you're reading, and depending on how fast you want to complete the course, it could be a lot to take in. 2. The tutor/mentor experience - My tutor has been wonderful. With rapid feedback, and giving real world expectations, I've been able to constantly be critiqued and judged based on whether a design solid or lacking something. I think that the tutor itself is worth the money, because being able to have feedback from an experienced professional at the drop of a hat is incredibly important to growing as a designer. My mentor has also been a great way of learning about what I should expect in the workplace, learning about what and what not to say during interviews, talking about design trends, how they got their first job as a designer, and many more topics. 3. The price - I believe I payed around 6,500 USD, and I can confidently say, without even getting into the Job Preparation Course or the Specialization Course yet, that I would do it again in a heartbeat. I think that for everything you get, the price of a semester at a 4 year college is definitely worth the investment. You learn everything you need to jump into the workforce, and UI/UX designers make quite a bit more in comparison to graphic designers for example. Being able to pay that back after finding a position in a month or two, for up to 9 months of feedback, learning, and conversations with people in the industry? That's value! Overall I recommend CareerFoundry to anyone who wants to advance as a designer, or move into the design field from a different field entirely. You'll learn what the real advantages are when it comes to having a different skill set, and be excited even more about how you can use it to become an even better UI designer.",coursereport

They were always there to help and guide and they are why I was able to stay motivated and finish the course.

I have been a graphic designer 15 years and took this course and they leave you on your own to find a job. They didn’t show me any company’s willing to hire. You will learn some things that you could learn on YouTube, that’s it. If you don’t get a 4 year degree with a college they won’t even look at you for UI UX. CareerFoundry won’t refer you any places to apply that can help you break in to the field.

Also liked the fact that you can always ask your teacher for help and advice. What could be better: they tend to have somewhat older articles they refer to for extra reading.

The way they have organized the course is great, you can immediately see your progress.",coursereport
1482,Careerfoundry,2021-03-30,"I am about 6 months in to the UX Design program at Career Foundry at this point. Overall it has been a good experience—the tasks are broken down into good chunks, the feedback and resources have been helpful, and the mentorship has been incredibly valuable. I definitely recommend Career Foundry, especially for the community aspect. My one area of improvement and encouragement to them would be to rethink the ""Time Estimation"" on tasks. It is helpful to know an average time, but has been a source of discouragement when I have needed to spend a lot of additional time on a project. Talking to my mentor has definitely help me set more realistic expectations and determine when I am being a perfectionist and just need to submit my assignment vs when I need to spend additional time working on something.",coursereport
1483,Careerfoundry,2021-03-30,"As a former preschool teacher who chose to make a career switch, I can honestly say my experience with Career Foundry has been nothing short of amazing. I am currently taking their UI Immersion course and am quickly approaching my Frontend Development for Designers specialization. I have learned about several components of mobile design I view through using apps day-to-day that I had no clue involved so much thought, all in an effort to prioritize the user. The communication and assistance given on all fronts is also excellent (tutor, mentor, and student advisors)! I feel more confident stepping into the design and tech industry now more than ever because of this program.",coursereport

1485,Careerfoundry,2021-03-30,"The materials are very well laid out, with clear explanations, relevant tasks, and a logical progression through the project. For the UX Design Course, I had a tutor to review the submitted tasks and a mentor to review the portfolio we were building, although I wasn't quite clear on what the mentor's role was until later in the course when we were finalizing the project. The tutor was excellent, giving detailed, personalized feedback in a short amount of time, although it would've been useful to have phone contact with the tutor because he was monitoring the ""day-to-day"" tasks we submitted. The mentor, who I had easy phone access to, seemed more distant, but it was good having access to her when it came to putting the online portfolio together. I felt that tasks were much more time-consuming than estimated, perhaps because I had no background whatsoever in design or technology. To that end, more support could have been given regarding the tools used for the course. Nowadays, there are a lot of online tutorials to help, but I felt that if I were paying for a program that advises that no prior experience is necessary, then training or curriculum should include detailed ""how-to"" units or workshops with the applications we had to use. Overall, a thorough program and appropriate if you are a self-starter and good at working independently. It is a lot of work, so you really have to keep up with the timeline, as nobody is monitoring your progress but yourself, and if you fall behind, it's hard to catch up. The program has given me enough knowledge about the UX Design process that I feel comfortable applying for jobs, although I don't know what sort of work I can get because I haven't started looking yet.",coursereport

My mentor and tutor are great at giving feedback and responding promptly to my submissions. There is no specialty track for data analytics yet but I've heard it's in development.

However, There are a few drawbacks. First, the course is not as long as they described. You should be able to finish full time within 4 month( the entire course). Second, the community is not very supportive. It is hard to find people to participate in your research. Lastly, most content is words, instead of videos, so it is a personal preference: whether you like reading text or watching videos. I feel that I am more focused reading the text, so it is ok.",coursereport

Although I did a little test about the course, it was not clear to me that the course is basically all reading and links that lead to more reading. Many times I couldn't understand some things and I had to look for other sources like You Tube. We know that a human being cannot stay focused for long, so it would be nice to have more video tutorials and, why not once in a while interaction with the other students (optional). I want to emphasize that the assistance of tutors and mentors is a plus, having the backing of a professional in the area makes all the difference.",coursereport

I find the curriculum good - some of the tasks here and there feel somewhat pointless given the lack of “real world setting” and its more of a thought experiment in terms of “imagine you’re on a larger team with different stakeholders” - but overall I’m quite happy with the new input and methodologies I’ve been learning so far. As an already established professional with almost a decade of experience within creative industries under my belt, I decided to take this course as a means of upskilling. One thing I’d have to point out though is that CareerFoundry’s UX Design course many times seems more strongly geared towards recent college graduates or people very early on in their career path. While overall I do enjoy the experience, the UX course is perhaps a stronger fit for people wanting to start a UX Design career from a very entry level job. Not a bad thing at all - just something to be aware of in regards to managing ones own expectations!",coursereport
1504,Careerfoundry,2021-02-25,"The UX Design course was a really great experience, the tutors and mentors really know the topics and I found that they pushed me to go further and take an extra step which helped me feel engaged and also deepened my understanding and importance of UX.

All the lessons are easy to understand, besides that, you have extra informative material regarding the topic of the lesson, and you feel all the time support by the tutor and mentor, assigned to you since the beginning of the course.

1513,Careerfoundry,2021-02-18,"I had a really good experience with Career Foundry. I was able to do the course through the German Agentur für Arbeit, which meant that I did not have to pay for the course myself. I worked on it an average of about 30hrs per week, and it took me 5.3 months to complete during which I also did some job shadowing at a start-up out our my own initiative. I thought the content of the course was really great especially for a beginner in UX design. My background in Fashion design helped me a lot in the design part of the program, but it was really fantastic to learn about the different UX research methods and having to conduct my own user interviews and usability tests. What I liked about the course is that it gave me a goal and incentive to complete the tasks week by week. I would not have had the discipline to learn all the basics on my own. The content was also structured in a really manageable way which clearly showed the design process. To this day I still look at some of the Career Foundry tasks when I start a new project because I have lifelong access to the course material. Sometimes I expected a bit more constructive criticism during the course, because it felt almost everything I did was ""approved"". However, my tutor did help me on a couple of areas where I was struggling. That being said, the course was all about being exposed to the Human Centric Design approach and much of my ""real learning experience"" only happened when I started working on cases where the outcome actually mattered. The course was fantastic to lay the foundations for that. I especially enjoyed working with my mentor because I could sense that he is really passionate about UX design and also about sharing his knowledge with students. Another really great aspect of the course was the Job Prep part. I had a fantastic mentor that helped me tremendously to update my CV. It was especially helpful when I applied for my 2nd UX/UI job, as she was able to assist me in practising mock interviews and give me a lot of great tips on what to prepare for. I was surprised that this assistance was still available to me 1 year after completing the course, so kudos for that! I highly recommend anyone to do the job coaching part as this has taught me lifelong skills that I will use for every future job interview.",coursereport
1514,Careerfoundry,2021-02-18,"I have nothing but great things to say about CareerFoundry. My instructors have been amazing, in every way, throughout my time as a student, and that has been the most important aspect of my entire experience. CF has built a community of supportive, engaging, and friendly people that want nothing more than to help and guide you through the process of becoming the UX Designer (in my case) you are meant to be.",coursereport
1515,Careerfoundry,2021-02-16,"I did the course between 2020 and 2021. I must say that this is one of the most support that I have ever had while learning a a new skill. The program is designed in a very holistic way, from the introduction to the career advisor. I don't think that I would be able to stay this engaged without having a mentor, a tutor and a whole student community. The mentor calls and direct feedback from the tutor are extremely helpful and help you learn quickly. You also have access to a multitude of webinars covering all of the parts of your career change process. I highly recommend this program.",coursereport

1522,Careerfoundry,2021-02-11,"I really enjoyed my experience in the UX design program with CF, I thought the curriculum was well established and the course was a good balance of engaging while still being challenging. I was particularly impressed by the variety of resources they offer (for example, a mentor for the UX course and a separate mentor for the job search)",coursereport
1523,Careerfoundry,2021-02-11,"After making numerous comparisons on features, pricing, and payment methods, I decided upon CareerFoundry to start my UX design journey. I also need to add that the customer service rep who I was on a call with prior to registration was top notch and very helpful to allowing me to make an informed decision among the various options based in Toronto. Being someone who is switching career and with no design background whatsoever, CareerFoundry's student advisor, tutor, and mentor had been very helpful and encouraging. I realized that some of the topics may seem too bite size for people with some design background. However, the overall curriculum had been very helpful for my progress to becoming a UX designer. One thing that to keep in mind is that the curriculum offered at CareerFoundry is self-paced with occasional reminders from student advisor if you're off track. This is not something for those with a lack of self discipline or determination on making it as a UX designer. I have just started the job preparation course, so I cannot comment too much on the job assistance part but there is a job guarantee feature to the program (given that you stick to some of the requirements e.g. applying to 5 jobs each week after the design part of the program is done) To wrap things up, I can definitely tell that I'm making tremendous progress and while the future does feel uncertain for a career switcher like myself, I do feel more confident in my abilities and more comfortable to call myself a designer.",coursereport
1524,Careerfoundry,2021-02-11,"I’m almost done with my courses at CareerFoundry, and I can say that my time here has been well spent. The course material is designed in a way that is more hands on, so while you’re learning, you’re building a portfolio at the same time. The mentors are very nice and helpful, and are always willing to book a video call. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants hands on experience as a UX designer.",coursereport

I had my doubts in the begging after not studying for many years, but the way the course is structured made it easy to learn everything. There's also a slack group with all the other students which makes the whole experience a little bit less lonely. In the group are also regular study buddy pairing sessions where you can find other students in your area so you can study together.",coursereport

There is also a mentor who looks over each stages, which can be helpful as well since they are experts in the field. The course is very practical and there are many tasks to submit but worth it.",coursereport

1532,Careerfoundry,2021-02-11,"I've enrolled in the UX Design specialisation course on October 2020. At that time, I only had experience in UX writing and just a little about user research. A couple of friends of mine who previously studied at CareerFoundry suggested me to give it a try. And I must say that I won't regret the choice! The course is super well planned: you get a Tutor who follows you day by day and gives you additional insights for each assignment, and a Mentor who revisions every one of the 6 milestones and besides that gives you great advise about the industry and how to get ready for the job search. In my personal case, both the Tutor and the Mentor were great, and they played a huge part in making me become a UX Designer in less that 6 months. I still can't believe it! Furthermore, besides Tutor and Mentor, students are also followed by Student Advisors for any bureaucratic issues. Moreover, you get a special Mentor for your job search too, guiding you through all the stages of the job search: from building a killer resume to mock interviews. I highly recommend CareerFoundry to anyone who decides to specialise in UX and even to those who want to change career drastically.",coursereport

1534,Careerfoundry,2021-02-11,"I took this course with zero coding experience and after 4 months I really started to have a good understanding of what I was doing. I recommend CareerFoundry as they have good curriculum with good support, while making the course challenging enough to give you a thorough understanding of coding. It worked very well for me as it is 100% online and still fast-paced if you studied full-time. My tutor was a great help as he was usually available and assisted me in a way where I could figure out the problem on my own. My mentor was also of good assistance and gave me a good understanding of what to expect in the course and upon graduation, as well as motivating me to not quit - which was enticing at times. I was lost in the beginning but with time I quickly learned and never made the same mistakes again. I would also like to add I am a 27 yr old who never had a real job, beyond the army, entrepreneurship, and pig farming, so the course was perfect for me.",coursereport
1535,Careerfoundry,2021-02-11,Very friendly tutors and mentors. It was a great introduction to UI design and helpful in learning how to use Sketch to work on my project. With these skills that I’ve learnt I’m able to make my own projects and practice further.,coursereport
1536,Careerfoundry,2021-01-21,"I started the career change course just after I graduated in marketing, because while I still liked the idea of working in an agency and being able to express myself creatively through my work, I found that marketing just didn't do it for me. I thought a lot about whether to really start the program or just try to teach myself everything there is to know about UI design but in the end I (obviously) decided to make the investment and start the UI design program at career foundry. Up until now I do not regret my choice. Since I've not yet finished the program, I can't talk about my experience with their job assistance, but I do have the impression that they are really keen on holding their job-guarantee and will do everything in their power to help you on your search for your first job as a UI designer. My mentor and especially my tutor are really nice people and do offer a lot of insights and great feedback. What struck me most is the speed with which tasks are reviewed and feedback is delivered. But I guess that will depend on who your tutor will be. As far as the curriculum is concerned, I do enjoy the exercises and while not everything will be entirely new to everybody - depending on your current career and skills - it is a nice and complete package with all the essentials that an up and coming UI designer should know, plus some more. Overall, I'd recommend the course to everybody who can afford it and is serious about becoming a professional UI designer. Especially if you are living in Europe, since I've got the feeling that the demand for good and savy UI designers is growing more and more; even with the pandemic not yet being over.",coursereport
1537,Careerfoundry,2021-01-21,"In 2020 I decided to change career paths into UX/UI. I live in Silicon Valley so I was in need of a program that was not just going to give me the certification I wanted, but also have a well-rounded in-depth curriculum. Sure, a well-known brand name school would seem great on paper, but I was searching for quality instruction. CareerFoundry was the first school I came across and, right off the bat, I was impressed by their customer service and their non-sales approach. Their Admissions Representative answered all of my questions thoroughly on expectations, job search, salaries, etc. As a student I have found that this excellent customer service pervades all of CareerFoundry from their instructors to their student advisory team. Even though I am attending a remote, self-paced class, CareerFoundry's program feels as if you are getting all of the non-on-one attention that you need. The curriculum is structured for many different learning styles. No only is the reading material no-nonsense and easily digestible, it is broken up with videos and exercises to practice what you learn. As I reach the end of the UX portion I find that I have a professional prototype to present to prospective employers. The Job Search portion of the course is designed to help you get clear on what you want and how to prepare for interviews. I've found that with all of my mentors, they are down to earth and have great insights from working in the field. I can't wait to dive into the UI specialization soon! Also, the price of CareerFoundry can't be beat!",coursereport

However, some topics have been shortened due to time constraints. But, if you ask the tutor and mentor, you will receive extra articles or book recommendations to expand your knowledge if desired. It offers a lot of knowledge compressed into a short time and is therefore a great opportunity for a new start.",coursereport

What I liked: - Flexible paced - Well structured content - Great tutor and mentor (they’re very helpful, replying on time and always pushing me to get the best results) - Student advisors check in on you about timelines, motivation, support - Big student community on slack What to consider/could be better: - It‘s 100% online, so you need to be able to push yourself - It’s a lot to read, I wish there were more videos available Overall I had a good experience! I learned a lot about UI/UX and the same time also about myself (what kind of designer I want to be).",coursereport
1543,Careerfoundry,2021-01-18,"CareerFoundry has been a very important step for me. Thanks to them, I learned a lot and improved myself a lot in design. The information on the course site is sufficient in many respects, but the biggest deficiencies are video descriptions, namely short descriptions. They are seriously missing in some subjects. Apart from that, it is possible to say that they are very successful in mentors or tutors. Anna Malysheva, who is my mentor in particular, has taken care of me very, very well and is a very successful person at her job. I can say that he has supported me a lot in my development. Claudia Lordelo, who was also a Tutorum, was also very interested in me and was good at communicating the necessary information.",coursereport
1544,Careerfoundry,2021-01-18,"I am deeply disappointed with this school. On their website, they assure you that you will get all the support you need from both a tutor and a mentor but this is false. They tell you that your Tutor will review your assignments and send you revisions within 24 hours, during my course some assignments took days to be reviewed, thus delaying my process on the course and causing me a lot of stress because without some assignments being corrected you feel stuck and you cannot continue working on the next ones. They also tell you that your Mentor ""an industry expert"" will give you detailed feedback on your achievements and portfolio. This is not true. I can say I never had a mentor because the mentor who was assigned to me NEVER reviewed my assignments or gave me any feedback. He did not review my final tasks, the important ones or attended my on-call feedback calls. I sent multiple emails to the student advisors and told them I was feeling alone and that my mentor wasn't doing his job. They took weeks to answer and gave me no solutions, I was not asking for anything extraordinary, simply as they promise, a mentor to guide me and help me in my learning process. After waiting a month for a solution or feedback from them, perhaps a mentor to review and do the work that the other never did, all I have received is a response that they are trying to improve their processes for future students. Very good for them if that is really the case but... what about me and the other several students I have been in contact with and have had the same problem? My career specialist is nice, she has helped me to improve my CV and has guided me in my application to find jobs, but I have to add that it will be 1 year since I finished my course and I still haven't found a job, they have no connections with companies nor is it guaranteed that you will find a job. In short, if you don't want to feel stuck, stressed and alone, look for other school alternatives as there are several schools with better and real reviews.",coursereport
1545,Careerfoundry,2021-01-11,"It's always a funny experience reading online reviews, but for what it's worth I gotta say I'm so happy I chose Career Foundry to guide me through the world of UX. At first, I was really apprehensive about enrolling in an online boot camp, I was worried I would feel anonymous and disconnected. As far as online programs go, I really feel supported. I have a great team of professionals (mentor, tutor & career specialist) who continuously encouraging and challenge me to become a better UX designer. In a sense, I feel more personally supported and guided than I did in college. My graduating class consisted of 84 people, so I feel like that says a lot about the quality of education Career Foundry will give you! Additionally, I'm impressed by how well the content is presented, there is a great balance between visuals and text, which really appeals to my kinesthetic learning preferences.

1546,Careerfoundry,2021-01-11,"The format of the program works really well. You can truly go at your own pace as long as you stay consistent while moving through the program. Most of the necessary curriculum is covered well, but occasionally a lesson will just skim over something and they'll kind of expect you to have strong knowledge of it based on the little they provided. I'm lucky that I had previous design experience before starting the program, which made learning the software feel a bit more intuitive. If you don't have design experience though, you'll still be able to learn quite easily and catch up to the others very quickly. The mentor/tutor program is decent. The mentors and tutors themselves do a nice job, but I get they impression that they are stretched very thin. The ratio of students to mentor/tutor is lopsided and can hurt the quality and quantity of responses at times. Overall, I feel I've learned a great deal to this point and I'm very hopeful it will be time and money well spent as I move along in my career.",coursereport

I have a graphic design background which helped me to move forward faster. The contents are demanding but so well structured and guided that I had no trouble at all. The focus is on learning technical aspects as well of designing 4-5 different apps, with the goal to built a strong portfolio to get hired. You could learn all the content for free, but personally I struggle to do self-directed study so I needed a course. With this online school you get mentor & tutor support which includes one to one calls with your mentor. That helps a lot because it feels like having a personal design coach, who gives you answers to your questions and reviews your designs. I earned the price of this course back in no time, because the salaries as a UI Designer are really interesting and nowadays it’s a demanding profession. To get this technical knowledge for your new job makes you feel more comfortable and relaxed than without having spend some intense time learning UI Design. I live in Barcelona and I know that companies are hiring graduated students from CareerFoundry. I can imagine the same happens in other cities. An other positive thing is that CareerFoundry offers the job guarantee course. I had the chance to meet my career advisor in person because we lived in the same city, and he gives me tailored guidance for my future path. He helped me to write cover letters and the CV, shows interview techniques and gave me a lot of tips. Paying for a career advisor cost lot of money, and here it's included! Personally, I didn’t get the first UI job from there because it’s focussed on being hired by a company and I was already freelancing, but I know from other peers about success stories. If there is a negative aspect it’s only that I wished a few more video tutorials than all the readings. BUT the practical side balance this point, because as a student you are asked to deliver designs in form of a task after each reading. Aprox. 75% of the time you’re designing and then receiving feedback from a tutor and mentor. For me this practical side was super helpful because I’m not such a good student ;) You will create 4-5 apps during the UI Design course which you should include in your portfolio. To have a complete and attractive portfolio is one of the most important aspects while applying for a new job.

I especially liked that all the exercises were part of a course project that I can now use for my portfolio. My tutor and mentor were very supportive and provided me with lots of resources. I deduct one point for the sometimes very extensive assignments that have to be handed in within a given time. In particular, when I first had to familiarise myself with new software, it took me much longer than predicted. As a newcomer to the digital industry and having family, this fulltime course could only be mastered with many night shifts. But I did it and I am very proud of my portfolio. In addition to user experience design, you will also learn the basics of UI design. That helped me a lot when I was creating my prototypes.

1552,Careerfoundry,2021-01-09,"I'm a career-changer transitioning from the performing arts into UX/UI. I'm currently enrolled in CareerFoundry's UX Design Program; I've been studying full-time for about 4 months and am over 75% finished with the UX Immersion unit. I did a lot of research into bootcamp programs and settled on CF because they placed equal emphasis on providing excellent training alongside great community and career support. Plus, they have the best financing options available. Most bootcamps only offer 6 months of interest-free financing. With CF, I'm able to spread out my interest-free payments over 18 months, which made paying for the experience much more achievable for me. My experience with CF has exceeded my expectations both in terms of the content quality and support. The project-based learning has built my confidence as well as my skills because I'm practicing as I go. I've found that the lessons are expertly scaffolded--I often feel challenged but rarely stuck or frustrated. I appreciate that I have an entire team invested in my success through my tutor, mentor, career specialist, and student advisors. I can also connect with students all over the world via Slack so I don't feel so alone in my struggles and triumphs. These supports have been critical to maintaining my confidence and hitting my goals. I've just begun applying for positions and I don't feel nervous or confused. My career specialist has guided me through the process in an organized and purposeful way. Having the confidence of a money-back guarantee if I'm not able to find a position in 6 months also takes away a certain sense of pressure I might otherwise feel to ""make good"" on my investment. CareerFoundry has really thought of everything. You can't go wrong in choosing them for your learning needs.",coursereport
1553,Careerfoundry,2021-01-09,"Great Overview of UI Design This intro class is a great way to begin learning the fundamentals of UI design. It covers: What UI is and how it relates to UX design What software to use and how to use it. Basic UI principles. How to make your work ready to hand off to developers. It should be noted, however, this is not a course where you make an original portfolio piece since you will be re-creating a finished app design. If you want to have an original portfolio piece you'd need to take further classes or work on that yourself. Overall, I really enjoyed the instructors' feedback. It was clear and extremely helpful. They also gave me plenty of further reading material to keep learning on my own.",coursereport
1554,Careerfoundry,2021-01-09,"I’ve done some bootcamps before but CareerFoundry is easily the top when it comes to support. When learning something new the most difficult part is always finding answers and with a tutor, mentor and a career specialist on hand there is never a moment where I felt I was doing it alone.",coursereport
1555,Careerfoundry,2021-01-09,CareerFoundry has been a brilliant course - the support from my tutors and mentors has been second to none and I am very excited to have been on this journey with them.,coursereport

1557,Careerfoundry,2020-12-07,"I wanted to shift from the hospitality industry to another field, and the CareerFoundry (CF) course was a great start for breaking into the UX design industry. If I was asked again, I would still go for this course. I was mentored by four great professionals that were incredibly helpful and supportive along the way. Of course, your experience depends on whom you get as a mentor/tutor (as in any other course with mentorship), but I have only positive things to say. I also got a job pretty soon, and right now I am working as a UX designer (working student role due to my university). But the course is very intense. In my case, I was working on it much more than it was advertised, at least 20h per week, and usually even more. Also, be prepared to do some extra research as you may need more explanation on examples of some subjects + the specialization that you have after the main part of the course won’t make you specialized in that particular field, but rather just give you a deeper insight into the area you want to learn about.",coursereport
1558,Careerfoundry,2020-12-06,"After spending 15 weeks with the UI course at CareerFoundry, I can recommend it to anyone who’s currently craving for new skills, inspiration, or even a new career path. Here is the list of things I particularly liked about the course: It’s entirely online. When I was deciding what program to take, it was relevant to me to be sure that my school knows how to teach remotely. CareerFoundry’s courses are 100% online, and those people really know how to make it. Moreover, I’ve always felt very supported by the student advisors of CareerFoundry — they were always there once I have a question regarding the paperwork, my progress, and any other issue. My instructors — tutor and mentor — were just great, and I hope all other CF students had such an amazing experience. I could always rely on their timely help and constructive feedback, got a lot of the industry insights, advice regarding the job market and so on. There’s also a job preparation course which is amazing, cause it helps to realize and conceptualize what you really want from your future career/employer. I also appreciate that the program includes a lot of exchange between students — there’s a very nice community of CF students on slack, and it was very cool to get to know them while exchanging feedbacks, participating in preference tests or other surveys. Nevertheless, I was not always that happy with the curriculum. I believe that it was done in the best possible way, but sometimes I was just overwhelmed by the amount of reading, another time I was lacking examples… But maybe it’s just me being critical :) Overall, there’s a lot of material, a lot of examples and a lot of people you can ask for help once you feel lost. Overall, the course has been pretty intense to me, therefore I don’t think that the full-time program would suit somebody who also works 40 hours a week… Aside from the time I sat in front of my computer, I also spent a lot of time thinking about my projects, design solutions, or looked at other people’s work. As I mentioned before, I took part in the UI course. I had some little experience in graphic design programs before and a bit of experience if it comes to user-centred thinking. Right now, I can really say that the course gave me a good foundation to develop my UI or UX skills further. I am still not sure whether UI design would be my next career step but I can really say that I enjoyed the process of learning with CF a lot and I can recommend it to anyone who wants to gain know-how in user interface design, regardless the previous work experience or education. I think anyone can learn something and profit from that!",coursereport
1559,Careerfoundry,2020-12-05,I'm so happy I decided to take the UX Design course with CareerFoundry. I learnt about all the stages of the Design Thinking Process to create an app. I like that the course is very practical and you learn as you design.,coursereport

The course has tons of resources as well as a job placement program. They also have a supportive Slack channel for students and alumni to connect around the world. I like that the course is on my own time, so I can work full-time and go to school - I don't have to quit my job to do an intensive 3 month bootcamp! : ) I'd highly recommend for anyone looking for a career change!",coursereport

With a real sense for progression, the course motivates you to not only achieve your goals fast but also to go a bit further and dive deep into a topic. I really enjoyed the tempo of the course.

When the pandemic hit, I lost my job as a freelancer in the fashion industry and realized how unstable the industry was. I needed to make a career change quickly and was so lost. With no previous tech knowledge, this course has helped guide me through difficult lessons and taught me an entirely new skill set. Ultimately, CareerFoundry has given me hope to turn around my future in an uncertain time.",coursereport

1572,Careerfoundry,2020-11-24,This is a great course for anyone who is looking to get into UX - whether you have background knowledge/experience in the field or not. Having consistent feedback and support from my tutor and mentor has been the driving force in keeping me motivated to complete the program.,coursereport
1573,Careerfoundry,2020-11-24,"When I was looking for a UX bootcamp in June 2020, I used Course Report myself. I decided to take the UX program of CareerFoundry. I turned out to be a great decision. My mentor is awseome, she helps me to develop as a UX designer a lot. We have weekly calls via Skype but we text regular about my project as well. She answers quickly and supports me finding solutions for design problems. I had some issues with my tutor but my mentor helped us to solve the problem - everything is fine by now. The job support is good as far as I can evaluate that (I just started with Job Preparation Course). The Job mentor is looking for individual advice and answer open questions. Really positive was that my mentor connected me with another person who had more job experience in my area. So far I am really happy with my decision and I can recommend CareerFoundry!",coursereport
1574,Careerfoundry,2020-11-23,The introduction to UX Design course offered by Career Foundry was a great fit for my busy schedule. The course being taught at my own pace was ideal since I am currently a full time student. I received a lot of helpful feedback for all of my assignments which made the effort I put into them worth it. I would recommend this course to anytime who is trying to learn the fundamentals of UX Design.,coursereport
1575,Careerfoundry,2020-11-20,"The structure of the course itself is great! My tutor has been really helpful, she responds within minutes most of the time. However, my experience with my mentor isn't too good, I had to wait for 3-4 days for his response, which was slowing down my career growth. It was upsetting that I felt like my tutor was the only person supporting me during the UX program. It really depends on your luck if you get a good mentor, and to request for a change of mentor isn't as simple as we think. I am currently still waiting for the mentor team to respond to me about this matter and hopefully I get a new mentor to give me guidance and support.",coursereport
1576,Careerfoundry,2020-11-19,"I read many reviews before deciding to sign up for the CareerFoundry's UX Design Program. The reviews tend to be pretty good, so I had high hopes when I started the program. However, my experience was not was I was expecting, and I'll get into that. Initially, I talked to the program advisor, and she told me there would be hundreds of mentor calls that would be available to me. That was one of the main reasons I picked CareerFoundry over DesignLab and Springboard. The program advisor was responsive and helpful. Everything sounded good to me, so I signed up shortly after that. What they don't tell you is that your mentor will only be available for limited hours per week. You will have to compete with your mentor's other students to schedule meeting times. I was in the program for two weeks, and my mentor was ""available"" for 4 hours per week, which split between students who schedule the fastest. I messaged my mentor and tutor on the first day and started working my way through the program. A week had gone by, and my mentor still hadn't responded. All of the useful insight I had received had been from fellow students on Slack. My tutor was Indian, with English as a second language for him, I often found him difficult to understand at times. I had my girlfriend, who is a linguist, look over some of the messages that I wasn't understanding, and she told me they didn't make any sense. I was on my second week at this point, and my mentor was still unresponsive, so I asked for a new mentor. They told me to keep messaging him, so I did, and I still didn't receive a response. I asked for a new mentor again (which I never got). I started asking if others were having issues with their mentors and tutors in the Slack channel, and it turns out I wasn't the only one. There was an active thread about people having issues (I took five screenshots of this). Other students had been asking for new mentors or tutors as well. I think there was a known issue with the notifications for the website's chat. Towards the end of my second week, my tutor rejected one of my projects. I looked over it a few times, and I couldn't figure out where the issue was because he was kind of vague. I asked him to clarify because I didn't understand. He told me, ""It's not that hard. Keep trying. I'm sure you'll figure it out"". And that was it for me. I sent a message to notify of my withdrawal from the program. And then my mentor responded. :) Overall, despite my bad experience, the program isn't that bad, but it is heavily dependant on who you get for a mentor and tutor. I talked to a lot of my fellow students, and the majority of them were having good experiences and were happy with the program. The curriculum, although not very deep, provides a solid foundation for core concepts that you need to know, and it helps you practice them. But because they don't make getting a new mentor or tutor easy, I cannot recommend the program. If they did, I would probably still be in it.",coursereport
1577,Careerfoundry,2020-11-19,"I've only completed the UX intro course, but the experience has been great. The course program is very well thought, you can track your progress through the website, the content is very complete and relevant and the staff, like mentors, tutors, and advisors, are all very helpful and nice. It's hard work, but you'll get everything you need to complete the course. Fully satisfied!!",coursereport
1578,Careerfoundry,2020-11-19,Wow! My personal experience was just great! I do recommend this academy so far - worth the feeling and overall approach. Tutors/Mentors were pretty sharp too.,coursereport
1579,Careerfoundry,2020-11-19,"The CareerFoundry program has a very well structured learning program, it is very well explained, at the end of each session there is a task to complete, which helps to better understand the content. The task is then submitted and reviewed by your assigned tutor, whom will gives you feedback and real life industry's insights. You will also have a mentor with whom you can schedule calls and review your portfolio exercises. Once reaching 50% of the program, you will then have the option to work with a career advisor on your: goals, career strategy, LinkedIn profile, resume, interviews method etc.. I found this option really helpful and the earliest you start with it the better prepare you'll be. Coming from the cruise ship industry, my background is hospitality, no previous knowledge about design, UX, programs or any technology field related existed. CareerFoundry guided me through the whole process, within few weeks I was already able to prototype and design an application. I agree that the price to learn is not cheap and you can found cheaper options but in this case ""You get what you paid for"". To summarise: Pros Great content and program structure. 1-2 portfolio projects to show at the completion of your course. Tutor to review all your exercises and guide you through them. Mentor and Career Advisor to prepare you to the ""real world"". Slack channel where you can join a community, find ""study-buddies"" or simply network. A lot of information available: blog, online office hours, reading material... CareerFoundry student's discount in programs. Flexible program to learn at your own pace. Cons Price. The program doesn't teach you how to use the tools, which can be time consuming if you're not familiar with similar's programs. A mentor is a pretty important figure in your career, it would have been great if you could choose and not get assigned to one. If you have any doubts or questions you can always contact me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/daviddevoto I'll be happy to connect and assist! Cheers David Devoto",coursereport

1581,Careerfoundry,2020-11-18,"I had been researching UX boot camps for months before deciding on CareerFoundry. I chose it because they have a full UI immersion course, and I feel that it has given me the exact skill set that I have been looking for to pursue a job in UI, UX, or product design. I had taken a shorter UX course through another company and found that it was lacking in comparison to what I have learned at CareerFoundry. The job coaching is also such a valuable resource and really helps to unlock the tricks and tools needed to succeed in the job search. I already have built a great portfolio and I’m not finished with the course yet. I feel confident that I will be prepared for the job market once I have completed the program.",coursereport
1582,Careerfoundry,2020-11-18,"I started the course in May, 2020. This goal for me was to learn to define how a business is currently operating, how to look for changes, identify patterns, and spot anomalies that give an indication of how a company or organization is performing, as well as improve technical skills like Python and SQL. This course is so detail-oriented and easy to follow that I was able to deliver great results at current my job by using new knowledge. This course is interesting and challenging and exactly what I need to give me the confidence to “rebrand” myself.",coursereport
1583,Careerfoundry,2020-11-18,"CareerFoundry gives you meaningful assignments that help prepare you for real-life UX work and walks you through the entire start-to-finish process of UX design. The instructors I've had have been very demanding, which is good, because I want my instructors to actually have job-level standards as opposed to checking off boxes. My main complaint is that the job prep course seems out of touch and recommends things that aren't good ideas (elevator pitches, evaluating your own skills on your resume, etc.)",coursereport
1584,Careerfoundry,2020-11-18,"I am currently taking the UI design program. Started in June 2020 and hope to finish in March 2021.

Offers a lot of support through tutors, mentors, and career specialists. A great deal of supplemental material can give real depth to the education. They break the projects down into task parts that are very manageable and accumulate towards finished portfolio pieces. You really get out as much as you put in, and I have felt very encouraged through the process so far (a little over halfway through the full immersion course now). The guidance and lesson focus has felt very practical with a nice mixture of the educational and the practical.",coursereport
1586,Careerfoundry,2020-11-16,I really enjoyed learning all these new design skills with this course. My tutor and mentor helped me to become a better designer day by day.,coursereport
1587,Careerfoundry,2020-11-13,"Unfortunately I was not impressed by the course. Most of it is platform agnostic, meaning the student has to do the extra work of guessing good external resources to learn a software. For 6k you would at least expect some guidance in this regard. Also there are no career service office hours in europe-friendly timezones, depending on where you're based, career consultants work around 11pm your time - at the same time tuition is the same for Europe and US. Last but not least they offer the free Slack version, meaning all important communication and messages get deleted after some days. Again, when asking for 6k for a 10-month program, you set certain expectations regarding quality. Heavily disappointed and wouldn't tell a friend to go there, this money can be spent in way better ways.",coursereport

Before I started CareerFoundry UI Design Course I really didn’t know what to expect. I didn’t want to make a mistake and make the wrong choice, so I started doing some research. This was very important to me because I was going to put all my energy and effort in this career change. Looking back, I realize there couldn’t have been a better choice for me. This was the best! I started the course after reading many reviews and all the information I needed. The course is incredibly well structured and even though you really don’t know what to expect, you receive support at every single step. My mentor and my tutor have been next to me all the time, giving me very helpful and valuable information about the course and this field I had no idea about at that point. They are very professional and devoted to it. I’m really happy and grateful for all their support and now I am heading towards the end of this course and am ready to take the next step. I really recommend CareerFoundry!",coursereport
1589,Careerfoundry,2020-11-05,"In this course, you learn all the skills to be a UX Designer. They even teach you some UI skills at the end, so it also enables you to work as a UX/UI Designer. I can definitely recommend this course because it is online, so you can work on it when you have time, you have to submit 3 tasks per week on average, which works well normally, can be stressful sometimes, when you re for example in the UX Immersion course and doing all the testing. I fould it challenging but also very rewarding, and all the feedback from your tutor and mentor really pushes you to give your best, they always help you if you have questions. I just found that a lot of tasks take longer than indicated, e.g. a task that takes supposedly 7-9 hours, took me way longer for example. But I guess that also depends on your background and how much effort you want to put into it. I have a background in graphic design which helped a lot. I would def recommend this course!",coursereport
1590,Careerfoundry,2020-11-05,"Overall an incredibly rich experience that comes highly recommended. The course content is well structured and keeps you on your toes by completing four tasks per week. I have a lot of commercial experience in graphics, design and project management, therefore I found the course to be steady throughout. Some topics were new and I found these more of a challenge. Obviously there is a lot to learn and I intend to go through the course for a second time as all online resources are available forever. There is a lot of reading and it took me a while to get used to reading everything on screen, but I soon adapted. My tutor and mentor were helpful, knowledgeable and supportive. I finished the course in around 4 months, but I like I said, I will spend additional time reviewing some material.",coursereport

The lessons are well-organized, easy to read and engaging with clear examples and video tutorials. I work a full time job in Sales and am a new mom, but still find that I can easily fit in at least 2 tasks a week to stay on track to finish the course on time. I also really enjoy how each student is assigned a tutor who provides prompt feedback on the individual, weekly tasks, and then also a mentor who reviews your overall work. Having two different perspectives and a lot of individual attention is more than I anticipated from an online, “go-at-your-own-pace” course. All the Skype calls, slack chats and task feedback are very constructive and helpful. From my first project to where I am now, I can already see a HUGE improvement and am feeling more and more confident every day that I’ll be able to pursue this as a new career path. It’s not inexpensive, but it’s definitely a worthwhile investment! If you are serious about changing your career and want to learn a new skill, I would 100% look into setting up a call with a CareerFoundry rep to discuss your options to see if it will be a good fit.",coursereport

Not to huge the large network of other students who are there to peer review and support you along your journey, and the student advisors and career specialists who are always providing advice, job tops, updates on the industry, etc. Overall, its been such a great experience and although I've been doing the course remotely, on my own, I do not feel alone at all!",coursereport

So far I don't regret this decision either. I'm very satisfied with the course. It's constantly updated and there are always improvements in the course material. So I feel well prepared and up to date. Sometimes, I wish I had a little more background information. Then I have to do my own research, which I find important for learning. I sometimes find the descriptions of the learning contents and tasks misleading and unclear. But maybe it's also because English is not my mother tongue. However, my tutor and mentor are always there to help me and usually answer within a short time. So far, every one of my questions has been answered in an understandable way. For most exercises, I usually need much longer than indicated. But I also have no previous knowledge in design and have to read and familiarize myself with the topics and tools first. I just started the job preparation course, so I can't say much about it yet. But after my first video call with my mentor, I'm confident that it's as well structured as the main course and that I will find a job quickly.",coursereport

My mentor changed during the course, however, CareerFoundry team made the transition very smooth. The tutor was always there and answered all the questions I had. The curriculum was sometimes confusing. As a complete beginner, I would wish some more tips about upcoming tasks and what to prepare for it. Between some tasks, there is a huge gap in requirements and you have to learn fast in order to stay on track. Job Assistance works perfectly. Every student becomes a designated Career Specialists who guide you through the course. The Job Preparation course also makes the job hunt very structured and easy. Overall, I would say this Bootcamp is a great value for money. I really do feel that I am ready for a job after these five months.",coursereport
1603,Careerfoundry,2020-10-28,I have taken part in the UX Design course and I would totally recommend it.

I have had all the support I needed to succeed in this course and I feel prepared to start this new position in any company.,coursereport
1604,Careerfoundry,2020-10-28,"As someone with a full-time job, a side-hustle job, a chronic illness and very little to spend on a course, I put doing this course on the back burner for months before I finally decided to bite the bullet, get a loan from the bank and just do it. And I am SO HAPPY that I did! While it's possible to do the course much faster, I am chipping away at it on top of my other jobs and make sure that I fully understand the material before moving to the next chapter, and all I ever receive from the teachers and mentors is pure support. Since I began the course, they have rejigged their course curriculum and it now includes more information on the job hunt and interview questions throughout the whole course. A tutor helps you go through smaller tasks and they also assign you a mentor who you can book calls with and go through coursework with or talk about the industry or how you are feeling along the way. It admittedly is expensive, and I am only able to do this course because my bank had mercy on me and gave me the loan. However, I found out that where I live in Germany, it is counted in your tax returns and so I will actually be getting some money back this year thanks to that purchase! More than that, an investment in yourself is always worth it- just make sure to do some free online courses first to make sure that you really like it!",coursereport
1605,Careerfoundry,2020-10-28,"I am past half way into the course and must say I have enojes every moment so far. The CF team, tutors, mentors and staff are super supportive and helpful!",coursereport
1606,Careerfoundry,2020-10-28,I can only recommend CareerFoundry for someone who is looking to take on a career change. You can do the course at your own pace with the support of tutors and mentors who are experts in the field.,coursereport
1607,Careerfoundry,2020-10-28,"I had a great time doing this very well structured and easy to learn course even though it was very challenging. Thank you very much, Careerfoundry, the Student Team, and my Tutor",coursereport
1608,Careerfoundry,2020-10-28,"I was really satisfied with this course. The theory is clear and well-documented but it would need a refresh. Especially in a fast-developing field like VUI design. There is a good balance between theory and practice and the tasks are interesting. I like how you can challenge yourself as much as you want, so you can stand out if you put in the work. It is quite intense so you really have to work for the certification which makes it even more satisfying to obtain. The mentor I had was a true expert and gives good feedback and motivated me. Recommending this course!",coursereport
1609,Careerfoundry,2020-10-28,"It took me years to figure it out if it's the right choice to enrol or not. During these years I kept browsing all the tutorials that I could find on Youtube and I was happy with the results but I didn't know why I was coming back to Careerfoundry to check their program. You can learn a lot without paying and there is a great free tutorial as well in the ocean of information that you can on the internet. I was overwhelmed with all these tutorials and though that I wasn't improving as I expected, so I took the decision to enrol and have a school like the style to keep myself under ""observation"". The best choice I ever made. I was lucky to have a superb tutor(Leticia) which helped a lot to have confidence and pay attention to the details. Sometimes the mistake was so small that you need to zoom 1000% to spot them and she did it all the time. She also went the extra mile to teach me that I need to improve my writing skills so I can work efficiently with the team and avoid misunderstanding that can delay a project(I'm not a native English speaker). The mentor(Shpetim) is extremely competent and professional and always straight to the point when it comes to providing feedback and even chatting about our daily life too! In this course, you're paying for the Mentor and Tutor and it deserves every penny because in 6 months I've seen a huge improvement and I'm more confident about my skills. Plus you have access to your course forever, so you can come back when you need to refresh something. The full journey is split into four parts: Intro to UI Design, UI Immersion, your choice of one specialization (Frontend Development for Designers, or Voice User Interface Design), and Job Preparation. Plus you have a lot of discounts to buy the majority of the software that we may need. I bought Sketch for 50£! If you are like me that you think 1000 time before spending money and that you can avoid it by using Youtube etc, just save your time and enrol with them. The time spent on Youtube will cost more than what you will spend on Careerfoundry. You know...time is a gift but wasted time has a huge cost! Don't do my mistake!

1610,Careerfoundry,2020-10-14,"I am very grateful with the careerfoundry team. The course exceeded my expectations, I developed skills that I thought I did not have such as creativity. I loved that throughout the course my tutor and mentor were always supporting and giving me the best advice to improve myself. Now that I almost finished the course, I can't wait to start working on my dream job",coursereport
1611,Careerfoundry,2020-10-14,"My experience with CareerFoundry so far has been Very positive.

My tutor and mentor are great- responsive and encouraging, and seasoned professionals.",coursereport
1612,Careerfoundry,2020-10-14,I started the UI Design program in may and it’s been wonderful. The tutors and mentors are very helpful and so are the advisors. The course is very well thought through and I’m very happy with my decision,coursereport
1613,Careerfoundry,2020-10-11,"I was apprehensive initially, but the hands-on experience in learning while designing is great. The tutors and mentors are really passionate about the subject and push you to do the same. Nearing the end of the course, but I am in awe of the amount of material access throughout the course. Thank you CareerFoundry.",coursereport
1614,Careerfoundry,2020-10-08,I am herewith submitting a review for Careerfoundry as a UX Design Student. Overall the course and the institution has been an amazing journey. The tasks and reading are very informative and the extra resources are amazing to dig deeper into the topics and expand knowledge. The tutors and mentors are amazing and guide you in the best possible direction whether it's for the course or the job prep. The course has helped me to build knowledge in UX design and get specialist guidance at every step how to work of UX designers are done.,coursereport
1615,Careerfoundry,2020-10-08,"Before I started with CF, (like many others) I did some research on a few other bootcamps - locally and remotely. I think many out there are very UX-driven in the terms of their curriculum. I'm actually transitioning from a graphic designer and I didn't want to lose my design roots entirely so I still wanted some UX but more UI. Thus, eventually found myself resonating with this UI Design Immersion course. It has been a fulfilling journey so far - definitely lots of discipline required. The whole course structure is very structured. All the resources are quite comprehensive and explained very clearly. There are timelines to keep you in check every week which is very useful. But most important of all, it's the access to a mentor and tutor that stood out for me. Both of mine have been very responsive to my questions. Another plus point would also be meeting and sharing with the community of CF students on a remote platform. :)",coursereport
1616,Careerfoundry,2020-10-08,"After engineering and a gap of many years wanted to get back to my career. In the process enquired about all the boot camps available. I personally selected CAREERFOUNDRY, thank god did not repent on my decision. They have a very structured program that gives students immense confidence and at the same time, it gives us real experience. The mentor and tutors are amazing.",coursereport

1619,Careerfoundry,2020-09-10,"I am a student of the UX Course at Career Foundry, currently finishing up and I can only say good things about them. The theory is very complete and their tutors and mentors do a really good job helping you find your way,",coursereport
1620,Careerfoundry,2020-09-10,"This is a great experience for anyone looking to make a career change. I have had a great mentor/tutor experience, and they have both been helpful in giving me valuable feedback and career advice. My mentor is also a graphic designer so we have talked about related skills such as branding and logo design. I think it’s a great program with good value.",coursereport
1621,Careerfoundry,2020-09-09,Great hold your hand kind of guidance into learning the scope of UX design! They create some content on YouTube and have very good customer service. If you don’t where to start their curriculum is a good start!,coursereport
1622,Careerfoundry,2020-09-09,"I started CareerFoundry while working full time at a job I hated.. I was welcomed with open arms by my student advisors, mentor, and tutor. We may all be in different time zones but it never feels like it. They constantly have positive feedback and always provide help within 24-48 hours! I’m so happy I picked CF over the others. I’m so excited to start my new career change! CF gave me the skills to not only build a powerful portfolio but my confidence as well. Pick CareerFoundry if you have the chance.",coursereport
1623,Careerfoundry,2020-08-27,My experience at CF,coursereport
1624,Careerfoundry,2020-08-27,"The tutor and mentor are skilled and helpful, and the course is organized very well. You will learn everything about UX here, from design theories to practical testing. I also like I can proceed with my course at any paces. I'm satisfied with the course mostly and I feel it was worth paying expensive tuition. The only thing I wished was to develop the project with a team. About job hunting, I see both students struggling with getting a job for a long time and students being hired very soon. I'm still on the course so I cannot say overall experience is five stars.",coursereport
1625,Careerfoundry,2020-08-24,It was a really nice and interactive course. I love that tasks are implemented after every lesson so students can immediately start working on a real project!,coursereport
1626,Careerfoundry,2020-08-22,"While working through the UX/UI program at CareerFoundry, I was paired with Neha Hurpaul for the Career Service portion of the program. Neha was amazing to work with, and is extremely knowledgeable when it comes to job prep. Any time I had a question, she took the time to give me a detailed and thoughtful explanation. We spent a lot of time working on interview prep and questions, and overall best practice for interviewing. This process made a huge improvement towards my comfort level during interviews, and resulted in better interviews with more call-backs! Neha really helped me feel prepared for all future job interviews, and helped me reorganize and improve my resume so that it really stands out. I would highly recommend Neha Hurpaul and the Career Service program through CareerFoundry.",coursereport
1627,Careerfoundry,2020-08-21,"I have been really pleased with CareerFoundry so far. My tutor is super responsive and helpful, and the course does a good job of explaining things so that I understand them. The price isn't bad, either. I would definitely recommend CF.",coursereport
1628,Careerfoundry,2020-08-21,"Oh I really enjoy the UI Design course on CareerFoundry! The program is well designed, the explanations are so good for each task. I am very grateful for my tutor and mentor, they are both professionals and are so easy to communicate with. I am almost finished with the course, and looking forward to polish my works for portfolio and start working as Junior UI Designer. ☺️ The progress I’ve made is huge! I haven’t yet started the Job prep course, so I cannot comment on it now, but I am sure it is as great as the whole design course.",coursereport
1629,Careerfoundry,2020-08-21,"The UX design course is amazing, so in depth in each of the various facets of the field - diving into some psychology, behaviours, analysis and more. Even without trying, you also pick up a great deal of UI and design knowledge which is great, it was always something I feared I wasn’t the best at - the creative side. Out with the course curriculum, the tutors and mentors I’ve been given have been super helpful, from quick reviewing of tasks and achievements, to providing rich and in depth feedback, with links to further reading. Not forgetting the student advisors, although I’ve had limited experience with them, anytime I’ve needed to reach out they are so welcoming and friendly - definitely good to have.",coursereport
1630,Careerfoundry,2020-08-21,"I find the course pretty great, I like my tutor and receive lots of good personal feedback. I wished that they taught more about how to use programs such as adobe xd as I have had to look up a lot of tutorials on YouTube to teach myself. Other than that I think the course is quite good and I am excited and hopeful to see how it aids me when I start the job hunt.",coursereport
1631,Careerfoundry,2020-08-15,"I have learned all the skills, tools and processes of UX design. A mentor, a UX lead in the industry with a lot of industry experience, is available in numerous video calls and has given me many tips and answered all my questions. All skills are first explained in text form and then you have to complete the corresponding task, which gave me a high learning effectiveness. I´m very satisfied thanks to the extensive program, the learning by doing method and the great mentor. Now I have a comprehensive portfolio with which I am able to apply. A Job-Preperation course offers support for the application phase from halfway through the course.",coursereport
1632,Careerfoundry,2020-07-31,I took Career Foundry's UX course this year and within a few months found a job at a health tech start up in Berlin. Great content and teaching staff. Overall a very positive experience.,coursereport
1633,Careerfoundry,2020-07-22,"I cannot recommend Career Foundry highly enough. I am in the middle of transitioning from teaching to UI design and Career Foundry has been the perfect choice. I have received well rounded lessons, relevant assignments and mentoring from people who are already in the industry. This in particular has been the highlight - the ability to talk to people about the industry who have real world experience. Although I am not finished the course yet, I am feeling more and more prepared to tackle a new field and use my new found knowledge.",coursereport
1634,Careerfoundry,2020-07-19,"After nearly a month of researching various schools and boot camps, I finally decided to choose the UX program of Career Foundry. At first, things seemed quite complicated, while looking at the portfolios of several of the graduates, I thought I couldn't handle something like this. Now that I'm at the end of the course, I realize that the curriculum is so structured that things happen smoothly and gradually, and in the rare cases where I've felt frustrated, I've always had tremendous support from both my mentor and my tutor. In the beginning, everyone goes through an orientation course, where they are introduced to the learning platform, as well as to what they can expect as support from their mentor and tutor. Ultimately, I can say that they both not only do a great job, but also do things that they are not normally required to do. This support is really important, especially for people who have no previous experience in this field of work!",coursereport
1635,Careerfoundry,2020-07-17,"I enjoy Careerfoundry. I have a better knowledge in the UI field and the tools being used. There is a great support from my tutor and mentors if I have any questions or confused on. Real job projects that were assigned after each read helped a lot as well. Within each read there are videos and examples of work that helped me better understand what is expected out of each hand over. Last year before Careerfoundry I invested my time with another bootcamp school, I didn't enjoy it as much and learn as much as I did with Careerfoundry. Im happy I took this course online after many hesitations. The Covid-19 happened and gave me a push. I can not wait to finish school and start my new career as a UI Designer.",coursereport
1636,Careerfoundry,2020-07-16,"This course gave a really nice overview of the data field. I learned a lot of really useful skills that I have been able to apply in my daily work life. Not only has it improved my practical excel skills, it has given me a really useful insight into the applications of data in the real world. There were parts of the course that I found tough but there was a lot of support there. The mentor and tutor support was really great. The tutor was really responsive and always happy to answer my questions. The mentor introduced me to the day to day life of a data analyst and also provided really good job coaching too. All in all, it was a really positive experience.",coursereport
1637,Careerfoundry,2020-07-16,"My experience on this course has been excellent. Really great feedback and support from the tutors and the mentors.

Also they were really supportive figuring out financing options that work for me!",coursereport
1638,Careerfoundry,2020-06-21,"I'm currently taking the UI Design course and I'm about 75% complete. The program is structured well, and although very self-guided, I like how the program sets tasks and shows you your progress towards course completion. Very helpful for me to stay on track and finish at the desired end date. As someone who is working full-time in another industry, this course works well for me because I can do readings and assignments all on my own time. I particularly like the Job Prep Course which is included in the program, helping me to edit my resume and craft my portfolio.",coursereport
1639,Careerfoundry,2020-06-19,"I was very skeptical at first about the boot camp but I’ve learned a lot about UX. I have looked at multiple boot camps and I found that CareerFoundry is the best.

Also the career specialist is also going above and beyond. I don’t regret it one bit. If you get the chance. Join this one. Do your research and you’ll end up back to CareerFoundry!",coursereport
1640,Careerfoundry,2020-06-19,"CareerFoundry UX desgin course is capable of consistently introduce the field even to a complete newcommer. The fact that the course is project based is a hudge adventage, allowing to make a foundation of your portfolio while recieveing feedback from an industry specialist. The curriculum itself is is supreficial on some topics, therefore digging deeper into the topic with your mentor and tutor is required in order to find additional sources.",coursereport

After reading a lot of information, I realised most of the guides I found are in Careerfoundry blogs. They are very helpful and I am glad I made the right choice! I have a full time job and am doing part time with the courses. Now I am on immersion courses. It took me around 6 months so far. I will start to look for a career in UX design field. Finger crossed! If you are looking to build the solid knowledge from scratch, I’d recommend Careerfoundry.",coursereport

I was a freelance graphic designer with no real focus on where my creative career was heading. In terms of the course - the material is solid, but the real winner here is the access to a tutor, mentor and career advisor. My tutor was by far the best resource for me in terms of absorbing the information. I learn better from asking direct questions and having someone walk me through the answers. Also, having someone give real-world examples of how they work as a UI designer really helps to understand how you apply what you're being taught on the course to an actual job or task. Subject areas of study: • Brief-writing • Moodboarding • Wireframing • Brand-asset design • Style guide creation and management • UI design • UX design • File-archiving and management • Design presentation and delivery • Prototyping • User-testing • Research • Data-analysis • Case study creating • Design practices and principles I landed a UI design contract within 3 months of completing the course, which led onto a full-time role because the careers advisor (Sami) helped me write cover letters, plan my CV/portfolio, and taught me how to research salaries. We covered interview techniques, and hunting in the job market, which is backed up by their job guarantee. This is where the investment in this course comes really matters. Paying for a private career advisor alone is more than the cost of this entire course. And same goes for hiring a tutor! I can't stress enough; if you're on the fence about signing up to a course to advance your career, stop hesitating and enrol. It will change you life!

1644,Careerfoundry,2020-05-27,"I recently graduated from this program, but it turned out to be highly disappointing for a number of reasons: the text is outdated and includes some incorrect information, inadequate focus on the latest tools and technologies for wireframing and prototyping, discrepancies between suggested examples and assignments, and a drive towards mandatory live usability-testing through recorded video sessions using 6 or more volunteers at a short notice, or by using paid testers at various monetizing sites at additional costs to the students. Also, I was promised 3-4 projects when I had signed up for this program but the program ultimately involved completing only 1 project (VELA) with little guidance on how to make the best of it in a featured portfolio. It is a huge waste of money and time.",coursereport

The level of exigency is high, so don't expect to approve it without investing time or effort. The help, support and guidance provided by my teacher Ryuka was remarkable.

My background is not tech related, and I was looking for a introductory course that went beyond the basics. This course did just that! It moves quickly and there’s an abundance of information to take it! Starting with no experience was intimidating, but platform was very easy to use. It was also very affordable and provided lots of extra resources for learning. If you’re considering a career in data analytics, I highly recommend this course to get you started.",coursereport

They would always get back to me within 24 hours. I love that you have lifetime access to the other programs to read over and do the tasks as your own pace too. Bummer no one reviews the tasks but totally understandable. I use skills l learned here almost daily in a non UX job so I am very happy with it!

I finished the course a week before I had a baby so I'm currently on maternity leave and will update this review when I have a job success story to share! My background is in fine arts and I spent several years in the visual arts industry. Loved it, but was looking for something a bit more stable and with a bit more cash flow. I started the UX Fundamentals and Immersion program in August 2019 and completed it in April 2020. I thought the curriculum was thoughtful, well presented and appropriately challenging. I liked how the program begins with almost a mini course that takes you on the whole UX journey, preparing you for the intensive immersion program where you really dive in. I lucked out and had an excellent mentor who knew exactly the right balance between praise and critique and motivated me when I needed it. I also found the Slack channels available for CF students really helpful for gathering participants for user research or general questions. People were always willing to help out and I was happy to help out in return, and vice versa. I also have an incredible job mentor and I can't wait to work with her when it's time to start looking. Having worked at the career center at my university as an ungrad peer adviser, I was so impressed with the Job Prep course - they break down all the steps to branding and defining yourself so well and each task prepared you for the next one.",coursereport

The course is written in an interesting and easy to understand way. And the examples help tremendously with the assignments. My only critique would be that there is a big difference between your tutor and mentor. My mentor (at the end of each module) always made me make big adjustments whilst my tutor almost always just said “GREAT” and approved the assignment. This became quite frustrating because I felt my tutor was just approving everything in order to move on. This then meant that I had to re do everything when my mentor was reviewing the material. Overall, my experience was positive but I wish there had been a module/section/more of an emphasis dedicated to learning how to use tools such as photoshop/adobe/sketch.",coursereport

I'd recommend this to anyone wanting an introduction to UX Design, although I'd allow more than the estimated/recommended times for most modules, especially if english is not your native language.

You get access to a tutor to get real-world examples of working in the industry, as well as direct answers to questions related to design and the course content. The tutors are very responsive, and at the end of every project, you have an assigned mentor that provides real guidance and direction on your work. As well as this huge advantage in learning, there are career advisors available that help you with your CV, preparing for interviews, and even applying for roles - which even comes with a 6 month job guarantee!

1662,Careerfoundry,2020-02-27,The course is very well outlined and covers topics in depth. Exercises help us understand the practical implementation of the topics and tutors and mentors are always encouraging and go extra miles to help and give additional resources along with rectifying the gaps in understanding. Will definitely recommend.,coursereport
1663,Careerfoundry,2020-02-26,"I'm near the end of the mini course Intro to UI Design. So far I'm enjoying it and looking forward to starting the UI Immersion portion! I rather enjoy this type of course where I'm working at my pace with a deadline versus a boot camp. I have tried the boot camp elsewhere and while it is a good experience for some but it was quite overwhelming for me. If you're new to UI/UX, this is a great way to go. I had difficulty learning on my own before, but this program is giving me confidence and keeping me on my toes!",coursereport
1664,Careerfoundry,2020-02-26,"I'm currently taking the full UX Design course from CareerFoundry and am just about to finish up my UX Fundamentals course. I find the course content to be thorough and well-explained, so the student can easily understand and apply the concepts. I also like how they provide extra optional readings for students to learn more about the subject. Tutors are nice and welcoming but I would appreciate if they added a little more detailed feedback on the submissions. I had one call with my mentor so far and she seems really nice with a lot of experience in the field and she answered all my questions with detail. Looking forward to more detailed calls in the UX Immersion course. Another bonus is the Slack community we gain access to as students, we can easily converse with other students, find study buddies, and help each other out. So far, I'm enjoying the experience and I'm excited to learn more.",coursereport
1665,Careerfoundry,2020-02-07,"I joined CF in November 2019 after experiencing doubts about my previous career path I thought.... 'what IF I could be a UI designer?? Well CF helped me make that dream a reality.. Turning my 'what if' into 'why the heck not' i have learned so much during my time at CF, the community is awesome and everyone from the tutors to slack community keep you on your toes and moving forward. At this rate I am looking to graduate a while 4 months ahead of scheduel. All I can say is so far CF and the full UI design course was one of the best decisions I have made. Thanks C.F.!",coursereport

1667,Careerfoundry,2020-02-06,"As someone who was changing careers after 20+ years, I was ready for a change. CareerFoundry gave me an amazing opportunity to do just that. From tutors, mentors, as well as the networking channels created for students, I always felt I received the support and guidance I needed. I was able to meet some of the most amazing and talented professionals along the way. I took UX Fundamentals, UX Immersion, UI Specialization, Frontend Development, and Voice User Interface Design - so definitely can speak on behalf of the quality of the programs! The job preparation course was extremely thorough as well. Most importantly, I landed my perfect job. Thanks CareerFoundry for changing my life and providing me the right skills to create my new career path!",coursereport
1668,Careerfoundry,2020-02-05,"A really comprehensive UX course with a Specialization at the end. I have my Specialization left and have thoroughly enjoyed the course so far. The mentors and tutors are terrific, offering constructive feedback while being encouraging. The one thing I must mention is that their recommended time to finish some of the tasks may be slightly off (usually takes a little longer) for students who are completely new to the field. But the advisors and tutors help keep you on track. I have not gone through Job Assistance yet, but I highly recommend Careerfoundry !",coursereport
1669,Careerfoundry,2020-02-05,"I have heard about Career Foundry from my boyfriend, who took the web development course, and I decided to sign up for the UX Design course with two specializations in Front-end for designers and UI. I am currently going through the front-end specialization and I concluded the UX immersion in January this year. Overall it has been a very good experience both for me and for my boyfriend. The material provided is great, you receive a general class which is not hard to go through and gives you the basics of the lesson but then also the possibility to dive more thorough articles, readings and so on or advice for textbooks. You also have a tutor and a mentor which have been very helpful for me, I had the possibility to make all the questions that I wanted and the reply and reviews were always very quick: one/two days. I am also doing the job prep course at the moment which is very well done too, even if you are not looking for a job I think it is a great way to understand yourself and how to sell you on the market. Obviously Career Foundry just give you the basics so it is up to you to deepen your knowledge through internships, meetups and further readings. I am very happy with this course and I would do it again.",coursereport

1673,Careerfoundry,2020-01-16,"I did the UI Design bootcamp and Job Prep through CareerFoundry. It cost around 3,400, self-paced, and completely online. The Course: The class itself was great. It has a great structure and communication with mentors and tutors is easy. If you have a question they are required to respond within 48 hours but usually it was just within a day. The course is up to 6 months but I was able to get it done in 4. I felt like this learning structure just really worked for me. The Job Search course/guarantee: Once you finish the course, you have an option for a free job prep course which gives you the guarantee for your tuition refund if you are unable to find a job. This was the part where I was really let down with CareerFoundry. First, there are tons of requirements that you must make sure you follow. CareerFoundry doesn't just come out and say what they are. I had to specificialy ask. There is a ton of follow up and check-ins throughout the course but once I started the job prep - contact with any leadership was really difficult. Next, The Career Specialist really didn't offer great mentoring. Their advice was really generic. I actually made a request to switch my mentor after she stopped answering my emails. I had a interview I needed to prep for and my career specialist couldn't be reached. After the 6 months, I reached out to several different people about getting my refund back. I sent all the information that they make you log. I had to follow up several times. Finally they scheduled an interview via skype. I'm in California and they are in Berlin so they were at really weird times. They tried to persuade me to stay an extra 3 months rather than get my tuition back. Then there was an additional exit interview via skype. Finally 3 weeks later - I got my tuiton back. I finished the Course in May, The Job Prep in Novemeber and I got my tuition back at the beginning of January. Overall impression: Great course. You can probably find the same info online but the structure was what made it worth it for me. However, I felt like after I finished they really didn't care about my success.",coursereport
1674,Careerfoundry,2020-01-16,"I'm a former childhood educator who recently switched to UX Design. I found CareerFoundry from a friend's recommendation, and have enjoyed the course, and found it challenging and interesting throughout. I'm currently at the mid-way point. I had no background in graphic design or any of the software, but have managed to stay on course, albeit slowly at times. My favorite part is the support staff, who are there to answer even the most basic questions, through instant chat or email messaging. A massive community of like-minded and supportive people around the world are at your fingertips whenever you might need inspiration or questions answered. Mentors guide your career goals and review your portfolio pieces. If you work near full time on it, you'll move through in under 6 months. A truly in-depth exploration into the history and present world of UX Design.",coursereport
1675,Careerfoundry,2020-01-16,"CareerFoundry offers a great online UX Fundamentals course. They provide you with thorough reading material, a mentor who helps guide you along your way and a tutor who is there to help with any questions you may have throughout your course duration. On top of that, when you unlock the Job Preparation course, CareerFoundry really does care that not only are you getting a career from your learnings but they help guide you through the online learning journey. I would reccommend a section that gives their students tutorials on how to use design tools like Adobe XD instead of sending us a link to their direct tutorials. Otherwise, the material is thorough and CareerFoundry is always on your side, ensuring you get the most from their course. A question is never out of reach!",coursereport
1676,Careerfoundry,2020-01-16,After deciding to change my career from a motion designer to UX designer i came across Career Foundry. It was appealing with flexible learning and not too pricey. I am half way through and so far finding it great. Incredibly insightful and well taught with reading followed by tasks. I feel like I have already learned so much. All I would say is I think it would be a little harder for people totally new to design as you would have to learn all the tools as well as learning about UX and methodologies. Highly recommend!,coursereport
1677,Careerfoundry,2020-01-16,"Although I only took a short-course for the UX Fundamentals, it gave me enough knowledge to have a good insight into the world of UX. It was well structured, and the tutors on hand were ready to answer any questions I had. Excercises were balanced between easy/medium difficulty and the time to complete was just about right. Would recommend for those interested into quick crash course into UX and see if it's for them or not.",coursereport
1678,Careerfoundry,2019-12-18,"I'm on my last task for the UI Design course, and overall it was a great experience and introduction to the world of UI design! My tutor and mentor were very nice and always quick to respond, which was really helpful when I got stuck. I feel very comfortable using Sketch now, and I can't wait to come up with more designs! The material is current and well-structured. The types of apps they have you choose from for each project (with the exception of one where you have total freedom) help diversify your portfolio. The course does a great job of teaching you the process of how to approach each project. I would definitely recommend this course if you're looking to learn UI design!",coursereport
1679,Careerfoundry,2019-12-18,I’m just about finished my intro to UI Design course and so far it’s been great! They’ve really walked through the steps of how to use the Sketch program well. The contact with everyone involved has been great and my tutor and mentor been awesome too! I’m moving quicker through the course than the target and it’s because I’m so excited about it and because they make it so easy to follow! Can’t wait to see what the next section brings!,coursereport
1680,Careerfoundry,2019-12-18,"I thought how odd its all online and with little or no contact with Mentor/Tutors. I have to do all the work on my own? No not true. It requires a different level of discipline, I did not think I had. But has been great! I am in daily contact with my tutor (Henrietta) at the beginning they sent me little screen capture videos commenting on my work and the more, I go along they write reviews and I have a Mentor, (Olga) I can call on skype and we can discuss what I need to do. I am still in the course so the Job Assistance. Part I have not reached. it is unlocked and I really should do it. l will do it over the Christmas break. It is nearly Christmas and started on Sept 23rd. Jan 22nd, I am finished with 6 weeks just to work on. My portfolio, I am already applying to jobs a the feedback has been great.

1682,Careerfoundry,2019-12-18,"A great course and a great organization. I'm more than halfway through my course and am enjoying the process very much so far. The structure, the material, the tutors and mentors are all great and they really help you to get the most out of your studies and stay motivated. I've never done an online course before, but I actually enjoy it very much and way more than I would previously have thought. The UX of the website is of course great and makes you feel motivated throughout the course. All excercises are very logical and explained in a way that is understandable to someone who is completely new to a topic, but also enjoyable to someone who isn't. There are always tons of links to articles or other material that helps you to immerse yourself even deeper in a topic that interests you. Overall I can only say good things about the course and CareerFoundry in general! And I am really happy that I can take this course and learn as much as I have.",coursereport
1683,Careerfoundry,2019-12-18,"I am in the middle of my UI Design course and took a sneak peak into the rest of the course material. To be honest, I didn't think of much starting the course, just knew, this will probably the best online place for a course like this. And it is! The strucutre is loigc, well written, everything you should know and beyond is there, the support is there, exercises that keep you on point, communcation, community, etc. Really well done, I have a great Tutor and Mentor, both help you along the course. And then we can build a portfolio which is big in the user experience sector! Nice couse, well done, thanks!",coursereport
1684,Careerfoundry,2019-12-17,"I was a teacher for seven years and decided for a career-change and I am so happy that I found CareerFoundry. I had no experience in design but the UI course eased me into the world of design and is equipping me for the real world. It is a 6 months course so obviously it is intense because there so much to learn. But what CareerFoundry offers is so beneficial to help you get started in a career in UI/UX. First of all, the curriculum is solid in their theories and the projects are perfect to practice what was learned. And the assigned projects are for you to include in your portfolio! You don’t have to worry about building your portfolio on your own because CareerFoundry has your back! Secondly, you have your tutor who checks your work each step of the way and you also have a mentor who checks the final projects. I have phone call sessions with my mentor and she is always giving me advice on my projects and teaches me extra skills and know-hows on particular topics. Lastly, CareerFoundry provides a job course that equips you to get a job. They help you with you resume, portfolio, and even you confidence. They have good coaches on staff. It does take a lot of time during your weeks to complete your tasks so you do need to have time management throughout the course. Especially if you are working at the same time.

1685,Careerfoundry,2019-10-31,"I completed the UX immersion and UI course with CareerFoundry and found the overall experience intense but informative. Make sure you get along with your mentor as their guidance will be key to your development throughout the course. Having a teaching background I can say that the curriculum is well designed and easy to follow. Also, they provide a great community to share your experiences with so you feel supported. From this point of view I'm satisfied, however the marketing is deceptive and I don't think the course is worth the cost. The course was marketed for 15-20 hours per week part-time yet I found myself spending double the amount of time. Juggling this with a full time job was so intense. I felt burntout and also lost the motivation and joy of learning this new field. They fail to take into account the hours spent on learning new programmes (if you're not a designer) and time spent on research and extra reading material (which is necessary to gain a full understanding of the lessons to enable you to complete the tasks). Also, I think this course benefits those who want to apply for work in the UK or US. If you're looking for work in the resf of Europe it's difficult. They guarantee you will be able to get work as a junior UX/UI designer but I was constantly rejected for not having enough 'experience'. I was unable to get a job and as a result gave up trying. And forget about getting the refund, it's impossible. Sadly,not worth the money!",coursereport
1686,Careerfoundry,2019-10-17,"I am almost done with UX Immersion and it has been an amazing learning journey and experience thus far... I had no background in UX before starting the course and I now believe I have the required fundamentals to work in this field. It is intensive because every task requires focus and understanding within a short period of time, but I guess this is good practice to get a ""feel"" of the real world. I am also blessed with experienced and kind mentor and tutor who are always there for me! They have been such a great encouragement and source of guidance in this new journey of mine! Can't wait to see what happens next!",coursereport
1687,Careerfoundry,2019-10-17,"I was sceptical about online learning, but CF did an amazing job of building the whole platform. The curriculum is very well structured and each lesson is followed by practical work. Tutors and mentors are timely, encouraging, helpful and their feedback is always constructive. Another great thing is that CareerFoundry offers 50% discount on almost every UX/UI design related software. I would dearly recommend it to everyone who wants to jump into this creative field.",coursereport
1688,Careerfoundry,2019-10-17,"As a full-time employee, I was pretty hesitant when looking at in-person and online bootcamps. What made me choose CareerFoundry was the flexibility of the program, the curriculum (you can tell it’s structured and written by professionals who know what they are doing) and the responsiveness of the staff. You feel like you belong to a team of people who genuinely want you to succeed, I have never seen them denying assistance to anyone, whatever the step they were in. Someone wrote that you can find most of the materials of the course online and for free — it’s true, but I don’t think the material should be the reason why one enrolls at CF. You choose CF because you don’t want to take all the steps by yourself, because you want to be backed by a strong community and a tutor, and a mentor, who carefully review your tasks and make it easier for you to identify your areas of improvement. I know myself and I know I struggle to keep the motivation alive (especially when I have to study after a full work day) and I’m sure I wouldn’t be able to do all this if it wasn’t for Carlo and Sophie guiding me through the course, providing precious insights based on their hands-on experience in the field. For me, the real value of CF is ultimately the “human” aspect. Don’t expect, though, that you won’t be doing research on your own and expand your knowledge on other resources. I strongly recommend deepening your UX knowledge on your own, based on your interests and your career plan: it’s an ever-evolving field so the sooner your start, the better, especially because some chapters are a great starting point but are not exhaustive in themselves. They give you the right direction, then it's up to you to carve your own path. Speaking strictly about the workload, I am pretty ahead of the milestones while working full-time, so the deadlines feel quite reasonable. I can’t say much about the job assistance because I have just started the job preparation course, but it looks up-to-date. I even started applying some of the knowledge I learned during these months in my current job and it’s very rewarding: I look forward to finishing the course and seeing what the future holds for me in this wonderful field.",coursereport
1689,Careerfoundry,2019-10-17,"It's been very intense and hard, but after each assignment I feel like I'm building upon my knowledge, which is great. I like deadlines and without them I definitely wouldn't come that far. Hope to finish the course on time. What the UX Design course (full-time) has done for me, is not to just spark a real enthusiasm about the topic, but also gave me tools to be more confident in embarking onto a completely new journey. A special shout-out to the brilliant tutor I had!",coursereport

I was worried that the material in the UX Immersion would be repetitive but it was not the case: the module is well structured and very focused on the course project. I am a big fan of the learning by doing approach and I am truly having fun while doing the course. Also, my mentor and tutor are simply exceptional: they always provide me with timely and encouraging feedback, not to mention the great insight into the UX world I can have chatting with my mentor.

It was for me, without any experience in UX Design, a lot of work, I had to study on the weekend, too. The course material and the links to important websites were very good, I learned so much, and I’m able to create wireframes and screens with Balsamiq and Sketch, prototypes with InVision, I learned a lot about UX Research, agile UX, scrum, information architecture and concepts.

1701,Careerfoundry,2019-09-12,To be honest I don't feel like your exercises are designed for people who are completely new to this industry. You constantly mislead students by posting absurd estimated times of completion when in actuality the task takes several days to complete. I am behind because it took 6 f**** days to complete high fidelity wireframes and my mentor was not satisfied because of them. Then the current usability tests are obviously heavy and require WAY MORE TIME! Then the 5 hours est. complete time it states (so fake and misleading) and I receive an email saying that I'm behind.

The support that I got from my Tutor has been crucial for me to keep my motivation high and also the feedback from my Mentor helped me a lot to see the things with a different point of view and improve my skills. Sometimes It can be challenging to do all of this by yourself at home, but so far I haven't felt completely alone because they kept encouraging me to communicate with other students via Slack and provide the opportunity to reach out the student advisor in case of any question or support.

The CareerFoundry program is amazing. The immersive program includes the theoretical foundations for a hands-on initiation into executing with industry best practices. While a fraction of exercises covered material I'd learned in art school or learned on the job, the majority of the work was new, and challenging. And the tutors and mentors encourage students to plunge ever more deeply. They are always knowledgable and supportive.

Having decided that UX sounded like something that I could get behind and focus on, I started searching for UX courses. There are so many courses available that I relied on reviews to seal the final decision, so I thought I should add my review as well. After reading reviews I went with CareerFoundry : UX Designer course. The main reason for choosing this was the reviews, and the job guarantee. Also their interface looked clear and the content really focused on the career changer. and that resonated with me. Decision made, I started the course in the summer of 2018 and managed to complete it by June/July 2019. The course is tough, it is time consuming and to keep up with deadlines certain other time sacrifices must be made. But I found the course fascinating and I felt really driven to finish the course so I managed to keep up with the progress indicators. The mentors are great (mine for UX was, Carlo Van Der Pluijim) , they challenge, support and keep you on the right track as you go along, tough but fair is how I would describe them. It's good that they pull you up on certain aspects of your work, as the whole point is to get you into a UX job, so you might as well do it right. As the course progresses you start working with a career advisor ( the one assigned to me was Richard Learthart). Richard helps you craft your previous skills into a great looking CV. His attention to detail and my work, definitely got me my first interview (and then job).These sessions and submissions are invaulable, probably best to start this half way through your UX course, it's more work but it gets you prepared for the next stage. Perhaps it was with luck, but also hard work and good support from the mentors and career advisors, I landed a great job (UX desginer) within the first month of finishing the course. I think location is key, be prepared to move if you are in a remote area. This course is very good, and it will equip you well for the career change. It's not easy, and it does fill your time, but it is well worth it. If UX interests you, then I recommend this course, highly. Thanks, Chris",coursereport

Both the UX course and the Amazon Alexa course were amazing! Their content was well organised, and often updated. Their professional mentors and tutors were always happy to help. They also make you feel like they genuinely want you succeed! Also, their Slack community was one of the best ones I've belong to: both the students and student advisors are active and engaging. It was such a refreshing and hands-on experience, I can't recommend it enough.",coursereport
1712,Careerfoundry,2019-08-04,"To preface, I have only been in Careerfoundry's UX Design course for a month. Now with that being said, it has been an absolutely marvelous month. This is not a school, this is an opportunity. If something is not working for you, the guys at CF will find a way to make it work. If you're not feeling motivated, they'll find a way to motivate you. There is also freedom; while there are soft deadlines and structure, the amount of freedom given relieves the ""chore"" vibe you might get from a traditional educational institute. The provide the backbone to your learning and let you create and cater the rest to your needs. I'd love to include some criticism, just to make this review feel more real - but with one month under my belt, I have none. If you decide to go the bootcamp route to learning, then look no further. The price, quality and quantity of knowledge cannot be bested here.",coursereport

1716,Careerfoundry,2019-08-03,"I've been doing the 4 months course in UI Design and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's been interested in graphic design or UI. The courses and tasks are great, I had a very knowledgeableand helpful mentor, Olga, the teachers are very helpful and give you great and honest input and feedback on your project. You will learn every practical skill that you need to know to prepare you for the work life of a UI designer. It's not a must but I would say that it helps you to somewhat have knowledge of Sketch before, just because I think you would get a better craftsmanship and result to publish in your portfolio. I have nothing negative to say about CareerFoundrys UI course, go for it if this is the design path you want to take!",coursereport
1717,Careerfoundry,2019-08-03,"When I was looking for a UX program, I consulted UX experts for their recommendations. Actually, that is how I found out about Careerfoundry UX Design.

I'm now halfway through the UI Design course with CareerFoundry, and I truly could not be more happy with my decision! The course walks you through the fundamentals of design, and as each assigned is project-based, you'll see your portfolio start to take shape as you progress through the course. Not to mention the amazing encouragement of the tutors, mentors and student advisors, you'll be in good hands! This course is fast-paced, but if you put a lot into it you'll get 10 x as much out of it!",coursereport

The curriculum (in terms of explaining concepts and assignments seem) to be a little unclear at times and that’s natural since it is a self study program. Though their staff and other students are generally willing to offer help and advice as long as you are willing to reach out.",coursereport

You have links to other sources and videos from UX experts with clarifications on the course. At the end of every course there is a task and you need to submit 3 task per week. You are assigned a tutor and a mentor and the tasks are always corrected by the end oof the day when you submitted them, or the day after. My tutor always gave me really clear, detailed and helpful feedbacks and I am thankful to her. Also on the course platform, you feel like in a real community. Overall, so far I have a good experience and I would clearly recommend the school!",coursereport

The material is built up very well, and there are always extra reading materials so you can dig yourself deep into any topic. The tutors and mentors are very responsive and passionate about their subject. Probably the most valuable service you get here are the monthly video calls with your mentor. I would also mention the student projects as a differentiator. These projects are very hands on and allows you to create a portfolio for yourself during the course, which will be your most important tool in finding a job in your specialization.",coursereport

1727,Careerfoundry,2019-06-13,"Don't hesitate to enroll! It's the BEST decision you can make and the best online UI program out there on the web. Several companies group UX and UI as the same thing and raise the price for their academies and instruction. When you complete the UI course along with the Job Training you are offered a money back guarantee if you do not obtain a job or get a certain number of free lance hours. Career Foundry makes sure your online presence, LinkedIn, Portfilio, and Resume are the best they can be. They guide you through practice interviews and sample questions. I took a course on DesignLab and General Assembly and the help factor was not as complete and organized as CF. You have advisors, tutors, and mentors that faciliate your journey through the course. General Assembly costs much more as well and you get much less. Seriously sign up with CF and take the challenge to build your career to greater heights.",coursereport
1728,Careerfoundry,2019-06-08,"I did the UI Design course with CareerFoundry in 2019 and since then I'm working as a freelance UI Designer. I have a graphic design background which helped me to move forward faster. The contents are demanding but so well structured and guided that I had no trouble at all. The focus is on learning technical aspects as well of designing 4-5 different apps, with the goal to built a strong portfolio to get hired. You could learn all the content for free, but personally I struggle to do self-directed study so I needed a course. With this online school you get mentor & tutor support which includes one to one calls with your mentor. That helps a lot because it feels like having a personal design coach, who gives you answers to your questions and reviews your designs. I earned the price of this course back in no time, because the salaries as a UI Designer are really interesting and nowadays it’s a demanding profession. To get this technical knowledge for your new job makes you feel more comfortable and relaxed than without having spend some intense time learning UI Design. I live in Barcelona and I know that companies are hiring graduated students from CareerFoundry. I can imagine the same happens in other cities. An other positive thing is that CareerFoundry offers the job guarantee course. I had the chance to meet my career advisor in person because we lived in the same city, and he gives me tailored guidance for my future path. He helped me to write cover letters and the CV, shows interview techniques and gave me a lot of tips. Paying for a career advisor cost lot of money, and here it's included! Personally, I didn’t get the first UI job from there because it’s focussed on being hired by a company and I was already freelancing, but I know from other peers about success stories. If there is a negative aspect it’s only that I wished a few more video tutorials than all the readings. BUT the practical side balance this point, because as a student you are asked to deliver designs in form of a task after each reading. Aprox. 75% of the time you’re designing and then receiving feedback from a tutor and mentor. For me this practical side was super helpful because I’m not such a good student ;) You will create 4-5 apps during the UI Design course which you should include in your portfolio. To have a complete and attractive portfolio is one of the most important aspects while applying for a new job.

1731,Careerfoundry,2019-06-07,"I took the ""Certified UX Designer"" course from July 2018 to June 2019. It included UX Fundamentals, UX Immersion, and a specialization -- I took Frontend Development for Designers. I also took the Job Prep course. The support network is great (great Slack community!) and the tutors and mentors are helpful and very friendly. The UX course material was well-written and easy to follow. However, the time estimates they put on courses I found to be way off for the meatier assignments as did many other students judging from what they said in Slack. I feel like improvements could be made in the Frontend for Designers part of the course. When I took it, it had just been re-written. I found it difficult to follow, too much information was given in exercises (I'm thinking of the JavaScript exercise here), and one or two of the tasks felt like they had nothing to do with the material presented in the exercise. It very well could have just been me (since I didn't get much sleep while taking this course and working two jobs!) but at least one other student said the same thing and found this particular part of the course difficult. I would not recommend taking this course if you work two jobs. I know your goal is to get to a point where you don't have to work two jobs, but you'll spend every waking hour either working or studying and you will lose a lot of sleep over this, which is not healthy. They've designed it so it should be manageable with 20 hours a week of study, but you will need way more than that. If you think 20 hours is manageable, add 10-15 more hours onto that and think twice before you sign up. Also, when you get halfway through your specialization, you can start the Job Prep course. For me, that was tough because I had to add that coursework on top of the coursework I was already doing for my specialization and my two jobs! I would suggest a slower track for people in my situation (i.e. stuck between a rock and a hard place because they have to work two jobs to make ends meet and are stuck because they don't have time to upskill so they can get a better job and don't have to work two jobs!) so they can have longer to finish the course. Having said all that, I feel like this experience has given me the knowledge and tools I need to pursue a career in UX Design. I know I have a very strong network of fellow students, alumni, and mentors I can reach out to with any questions, concerns, or project ideas from now on and that is incredibly valuable! Despite everything, I have truly enjoyed my experience with CareerFoundry.",coursereport

The simple, informative and practical exercises were easy to follow, and when I had any doubts or issues I was able to contact my tutor via chat to get help. My tutor and mentor were very supportive throughout my time at Careerfoundry. As a waitress with no design / technology background, I was a bit intimidated by all of the new information, but my tutor and mentor gave me encouraging feedback throughout and helped me to feel confident about my work. I think Careerfoundry UX Immersion course is great for anyone wishing to change careers or learn more about ux design because it is comprehensive and covers every aspect of user experience design. I highly recommend it!",coursereport
1734,Careerfoundry,2019-05-29,"I took a full certified ux design courses, which took me a whole year to finish (including career prep courses). I switched my career and had no design background at all, but I managed to land a ux job within 3 months after graduation. I have to say that CareerFoundry provides a lot of great foundation knowledge for ux design and the teachers are very nice. My tutor was Jonny who gave me great advice and encouragements during my UX studies, and my mentor Leah who mentored me through my “UI for UX” specialization courses. She is always there for me even when the courses are finished. When I was about to graduate , she even gave me some personal projects to do and it helped me build my portfolio with real clients. My career advisor Sami always reached out to me and taught me many useful tips about interviewing and job searching. CareerFoundry also has a platform on slack so all students and teachers can communicate there freely admins support each other. However, only focus on the Curriculum is not enough, students might end up having 2-3 projects on the portfolio after graduation from CareerFoundry, but in real world, companies want to see some projects with real clients. If anyone who wants to get a job after graduaiton, he needs to work hard and improves skills after school, looks for clients to work on real projects. and sacrifices his leisure time. CareerFoundry also advised what to do after graduation. They have done the best they can and I’m glad and grateful that through CF I become a real designer.",coursereport

The exercises are building on each other so I observed automatically when I misunderstood a part of the subject.

1753,Careerfoundry,2019-04-05,"Currently in the first month of the UX Design course. When I was looking around for a UX course, I knew that I wanted a project-base curriculum, which CF offers. The program is set up so that you have access to a mentor and tutor, and I've already met with my mentor twice and interacted with my tutor about ~10 times. They're responsive and I'm always grateful for all the in-depth, immediate responses I've gotten from them every time I shot them a message. The CF platform is full of supports, and they also offer a Slack channel where students can help each other. I've always had positive interactions with other students so far. While I do wish I could collaborate with other students more (as I probably would in a in-person course), I think with all of the different avenues they offer for communication (chat bars + Slack), it can be accomplished with a bit more effort.

The program is extremely well structured, organized and full of information about the UX/UI industry. On completion of the UX Design Immersion I was able to have two substantial case studies that I am very happy with. I definitely put a lot of effort into the Fundamentals course in the beginning so I was able to build a strong foundation before I started the Immersion. Also- after completion of the Immersion and with the benefit of everything I learned during the program, I revisited my Fundamentals project and was able to bring it up to a much higher level. I also feel confident about creating more studies on my own, as the CF curriculum provided me with such a strong understanding of research methods and best practices. Of course the program is online, and depends completely upon the self discipline and tenacity of the student. One must be earnestly committed and work hard to see results. I found the platform to be very well organized and it was easy for me to understand what was expected. In addition to explanations and examples, it was great to have online references and articles which also helped with the learning experience. The assignments are clear and explicit and build upon each other logically to create a robust case study project. My tutor Terri Rodriguez was wonderful, and always there if I need to ask her a question. Her responses were always within 24 hours, usually much quicker. She was encouraging, inspirational and definitely made me feel supported. Dana Lynn was my mentor and always offered honest clear feedback. She truly helped clarify things for me when I had questions and provided authentic encouragement. Dana has a rich background in both UX and visual design so her feedback was very helpful for me on multiple levels. I am so grateful to this great team! After this wonderful experience, I am looking forward to the UI Design and Voice Specializations! Thanks CareerFoundry!",coursereport
1756,Careerfoundry,2019-04-05,Tutor and mentors are very good at breaking down your assignments and showcasing weaknesses and strengths. Sessions provide great constructive criticism with clear ways of improving. Only caveat of the course is that you do have a time limit to complete assignments and if you go over you will need to request an extension and pay more. But the site breaks down completion date very well so that you can plan the pace you need to finish the course.,coursereport
1757,Careerfoundry,2019-04-05,"I signed up to the UI design course after working in SEO and wanting a career change. I must say the course has been fantastic so far. It is excellently laid out and it's intuative work flow is very engaging and comprehensive. With no UI or UX experience in the past, I feel like I have learned so much. They really do take you from the ground up. It is well paced, interesting and I am able to stay creative throughout. I would certainly recommend this course to anyone looking to venture into this field or looking for a career change.",coursereport

The course has great quality, the reading materials are all up-to-date, there are also a lot of examples of best practices given and links to the other helpful articles and so on. But the most value for me as a student comes from the practical tasks and tutor's feedback! You can always find free materials to learn from online, but only on the course like this you can build your own portfolio with guided feedback, which is incredibly valuable. Tutors and mentors are always available whenever there are questions, and help to look at your career path as a ""big picture"", so you know where you are and where you are going. All in all, I cannot recommend this course more! I already use a lot of the learned techniques in my daily tasks, and now I can't help but look through UX-eyes on my everyday surroundings.. it changes perspective, and you start noticing the details :)",coursereport

I found CF by chance on a Google search, and with 80% of the course finished I can affirm that it was a great decision. The learning methodology is very nice, and you really learn deeply everything a professional does in his day to day work. In my case I have done the UI course ( working 30h week), and although now I am more interested in UX, for me the course has been a perfect starting point in my career. I haven't started yet the search for a new Ui-UX job, but with everything I have learned in recent months, I am confident in myself and surely everything will be all right with the job preparation course.",coursereport

With the world migrating to a digital experience, I knew that to be a successful designer in the future I needed new skills. I researched for several months but always came back to CareerFoundry. I requested a call to help answer some of my concerns. After that first call with Matt, a UI Designer in Seatle, I was sold. It was challenging for sure and they don't just give out certificates. You earn it. The one on one calls with the mentor and the feedback you receive from your tutor is amazing. The biggest plus is the support. They have folks that will help you with the tuition questions, actual UI of the course itself, Career Preparation support and pretty much every touch point of the experience. Can not say enough about the job prep course and the job prep counselor. The conversations I had with the mentor, tutor and job prep contact was terrific. I switched from a graphic designer to a UI/UX Designer and couldn't be happier!! Best decision of my career!!!",coursereport

I'm very disappointed because I wanted to finish it out well, and in the final month I had submitted my work for their review and needed help finishing. They never got back to me before the course ended and I never graduated. I'm frustrated I spent this much money only to have them slowly pull the plug while I was enrolled.

1763,Careerfoundry,2018-10-15,"After extensive research for online and in-person ""bootcamp"" / Masters courses for UX Design, I decided to go with the online course at CareerFoundry based on reviews and the overall cost. I chose the $6,000 USD Certified UX Designer three-part program which pairs each student with tutor and a mentor with whom you have unlimited Skype calls. Each reading / lesson finishes with an assignment that you must submit for your tutor to review. Your tutor with give constructive feedback in order to make sure you get the most out of each project. At the end of each unit - there are between 7-12 lessons per unit - your mentor will review your portfolio and offer feedback as well. There are currently a total of seven units in the course. Your mentor is there for you to reach out to as often as you need in order to ask questions about the course, about design, or about the industry -- your calls are dedicated to what you need in regards to UX Design. At the end of the entire course each student will have a completed project to add to your online portfolio! The course also offers an extra specialization course for you to take in order to deepen your knowledge within the field. Currently they are offering specializations in: UI Design, Frontend Development for Designers, or Voice User Interface Design. - 7 units for the Certified UX Designer Course - 7-12 assignments per unit - total of 244 hours of course work for the Certified UX Designer Course - plus an additional total of 78 hours on the UI Design Course (other specialization courses have similar completion hours as well) - a total of 51 hours in their Job Preparation Course that helps you prepare for the search including tips on networking, mindset for career change, resume tips, and interviewing. I recommend this course to anybody looking to make a career change or simply learn more about user experience design. I was able to work full time, complete the course within five months and then focus on networking and the job search! The mentors and tutors all work in the field and offer valuable feedback. CareerFoundry also builds a community of their students - past and present - on Slack that allows for great networking throughout and after the course. Through hard work on my end with networking and the job search, I was able to get a job offer as a mid-level UX Designer within 3 months of finishing up the course and putting together my online portfolio. I didn't find much value in the job prep course as I already felt like I was doing all the right things to get my foot in the door within the industry. However, if people don't know where to begin - I think the job prep will be a good place to help those find work after the course! But its not all up to your tutor, mentor, and job prep contact -- you must put in the effort to network and build connections within the industry as hard as it is, it will be worth it in the end. Sometimes that means taking up freelance or contract work to build your portfolio before getting that full-time job offer you're after!",coursereport
1764,Careerfoundry,2018-10-12,"I took the online UI design course. I loved it! The content is good, the mentors are great and the course lasts for 6 months, but besides that, it's pretty much self-paced which worked perfectly with my busy schedule. The job prep course was super helpful! They gave me actionable steps and excellent feedback to start my job search. When I had questions or needed to prep, my mentor was there for me. So, in the end, I walked out feeling confident with a beautiful portfolio and ready to interview. In 2 months I had a ton of interviews, received 3 job offers and landed my dream job.

I've had prior experience doing some UI work and wanted to take this course to solidify what I've learned on my own. I briefly read over the material before joining and it did not disappoint. I had a tutor and a mentor, that I could ask as many questions as I needed too. Also, everyone gets to join the Slack community. So, everyone is on the same boat as you - asking for help or advicem, tips and tricks. I did notice the course does get updated if the staff realizes the coursework is outdated or needs a bit of modifying. There consistent emails from student advisors to encourage you and be there for you if you need additional help. At the end of the course you will receive a certificate.",coursereport
1766,Careerfoundry,2018-07-10,"I divide my experience with CF in 2 parts. 1) The UX course. I appreciate to have an organised step by step theoretic explanation of the UX design process. I can say I learnt UX design during the course. I would advise everyone who want to take the course to be sure to have enough time for it. I did the course while working and it turned into a frustrating experience at times because I was doing something I love but I didn't have enough time to do it properly and produce the quality work I wanted. My tutor and mentor were both very helpful. I had to request more in depth reviews of my work but after it went pretty smooth. The course was never mentioned by the companies I applied to, so I don't really know if it helped me find a job. I haven't come back to the theory yet, not sure if I'll do in the future. 2) The find a job course Surprising enough, I had better memories of this optional course. You have to go through exercises that help you get to know yourself better, something very helpful when applying for jobs and life in general. I had assigned a career adviser, Mike, he is very supporting and has lot of experience in the field. If you keep a proactive attitude and set training interviews with him, you will feel ready for the interviews. It was actually what happened to me. When I landed in the interview, I knew the answer (a good one, following Mike's advice) to almost every question they could ask me.",coursereport
1767,Careerfoundry,2018-06-18,"I joined CareerFoundry not because I wanted to get a job as a web developer (I’ve been a web developer for three years), but because I like learning. Over my career, this is the fourth “coding boot camp” I’ve attended and completed, and I can say that it’s by far the most well-written and well-thought-out of all. CareerFoundry’s writing is very easy to read and understand. The curriculum is also well-thought-out as it covers the full stack from front to back. It even touches on some extras toward the end that will show potential employers that you’ve gone above and beyond the fundamentals. All in all, I’d say this is a great course for beginners, but, like all coding boot camps, you’ll need at least some basic computer skills. If you’re brand new to coding and you’re not a fast learner, you may need to do some extra research on your own time in order to catch up with the lesson. If you have the time, I’d recommend going through a free front end course or two (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) before signing up here as you’ll be able to hit the ground running and you’ll be able to absorb more material overall as you progress. Fantastic course!",coursereport
1768,Careerfoundry,2018-06-03,"I am currently in my last module of (iOS dev course) and I am pretty satisfied with my decision, why!!! let me tell you why I got some interesting offers before the completion of the course. The support I get from my student advisor, tutor and mentor is phenomenol. Specially student advisor (Korina, and Cicely too). The course is well structured, up to date and it covers every step in the life cycle of the app. Slack community is also very active and supportive, specially the designing students. As in the start I mentioned that I havent completed the course yet, because of which I havent interacted with the career change team but because the other CF team is so supportive and good in their jobs its safe to assume that they are good too ( but surely I will keep u updated 😉 ) Before I finish my review let me tell you one very important thing, the whole journey is not walk in the park, if you seriously want to achieve your goal (what ever that is, career change or improving your skills etc) you have to work really hard for yourself, from time to time you will face problems whose solutions are not straight forward and make you pull your hairs out, but the effort which you will do in solving them is the fruit of the whole journey.

I know that these things can really be a scam, and did not want to commit to paying thousands without being sure I would get as much as possible out of my course. I found a job even before I graduated, the mentors could not have been more supportive, and the school really helps you every step of the way. I really think that those who have not had good experiences with CareerFoundry perhaps did not do their part. Sure, you need to be assertive, disciplined enough to work from home, and willing to reach out to your mentor whenever necessary, but if you do all those things, you will succeed. CareerFoundry has really changed my overall career trajectory for the better and it's been a completely enjoyable experience overall.",coursereport

It covered everything that was needed to make first projects on my own and start applying for junior jobs. I've got a lot of support from my mentor and from other students. I am still in touch with them 3 years after finishing the course and can still count on some nice review! Lifetime access to notes and lessons is a huge advantage when doing first steps on your own.

1771,Careerfoundry,2018-05-12,"I came from an unrelated field so I did not have much experience in the UX field. But chose Career Foundry as the course ""guaranteed a job or my money back"". I spent around £2500 and to be honest I feel I could have used that money in a better way in trying to change careers. The course itself seemed well structured and my mentor was helpful. At the end of the 6 months I had one project to show for my work which I could use when applying for jobs. There is a smaller short course that focuses on 'career change' and I was only able to complete 9/10 modules due to other restrictions on my time. After I completed the course I spent 6 months applying for jobs but found the process extremely difficult. I did not even receive one interview after the coaching and help from careerfoundry. I think most people who find success come from a related field like design or programming. I made a request for a refund but the conditions for a refund are extremely stringent, I later found out and the request was denied. Pros: Well structured syllabus which moved at a decent pace. Mentors are helpful (Well my mentor was). Cons: There is no special job board, I received one link to a job but it was completely inappropriate. After graduation you will only have one complete project – so the course places an emphasis on self-learning and creating your own projects. This made me think I could've self-learnt the whole course and created my own projects. There is a lot of emphasis on linkedin and networking to find a job. This made me question why I did the course if this was the best way to get a job. My advice If I could do this again, I would learn UX design from Udemy or Lynda, then learn how to network to get a job. You'll save a lot more money.",coursereport

I had some doubts before booking this course, as it's quite an investment and I did not have any experience with online schools. I didn't think they could offer real value but thank god - I was wrong! Studying at Careerfoundry is the best decision I've made so far - the things you learn are really hands-on, you're working on portfolio pieces and you don't have to reads dozens of books or study for exams. My tutor Allison was great in guiding my throughout the course: she gave extensive, helpful and motivation feedback within hours after sending in exercises and would always go an extra mile if I needed more support. The same goes for my mentor Pia, who supported me with finding a UX job and helped me prepare for the job interview (with success!) The support of your tutor and mentor is what makes Careerfoundry so special - you have professionals guiding you. The curriculum is pretty straight forward: you're designing an app following the Design Thinking Process. The course exists of 6 Achievements with around 25-30 exercises per Achievement. Some exercises are more theoretical and teach you about the basics of psychology, other exercises are more technical and show you how to work with all relevant tools in the field. At times, the course can be pretty demanding - especially when you're working fulltime. Expect to spend at least 10-15 hours a week on the course - yet in the end it will all be worth it!",coursereport
1773,Careerfoundry,2018-04-18,"When I took the course I already had many years of experience in Graphic/Web design so some contents weren't new for me. I took it because I wanted to gain more knowledge on UX design and also have the academic trainee and the official certification. The first part of the course was the most interesting, it's focused on UX thinking, business goals, competitor analysis, usability, prototypes, etc... Then we started with wireframes, user flows, visual design and google analytics. This second part was something I already knew so I didn't took much advantage of it. But if you are a beginner, it will be useful. It took me almost 3 months to finish the course and I spent around 3-4 hours per day (every day you have a different subject so you have to go through the content and then complete the assignment). You will have a mentor and you can ask him/her everything you need, that’s pretty cool. The course worth the money. In 3 months you will have an good overview, create a connection with your mentor and you will create a project for your portfolio that will help you to get your first job in UX.",coursereport

Career Foundry has fulfilled all my hopes and wishes related to (1) professional support on my learning path, (2) learning topics that a UX designer needs to know, (3) taking a good course that would support me on all the way from learning to getting a job. (1) The support from my tutor and mentor during the course was great. Their feedback to my work was relevant and helpful. (2) I really liked the way in which the content was presented.

(3) Unfortunately, I didn´t have time to finish the Job Preparation Course, as I already started working on my own startup with some friends.

I decided to switch careers, with a background in Business Management and Marketing. I found the course itself to be challenging enough without being overwhelming, and having access to support of my tutor (Allison), mentor (Pia), and the awesome people in the Slack group. That sort of support is really necessary when you're doing an online course, that too about a field that you don't have much previous knowledge about. The exercises and tasks themselves were very clearly explained, with just enough focus on theory and more on the practical aspect of things. Each lecture provides and extensive list of additional reading materials if you want to learn more about a topic you like. The tutors and mentors challenged me to produce my best work, which did get frustrating at times, but in a good way! The portfolio review at the end of each ""achievement"" really helps in putting all the work that you've done into perspective from a portfolio-point-of-view. They encourage and train you to not only work like a designer, but to think like a designer, which goes a long way! Now they've updated the curriculum with video tutorials and quizzes, which adds to the 'gamification' of the entire course, and will make it more dynamic and fun! The career counsellors are, as with the tutors and mentors, readily available to help prepare for CV/cover letter building, portfolio feedback, job interviews, or any other job-related queries you might have. I've been working with Mike, and he's been a great help! I would highly, highly recommend this course to anyone thinking of going into this field and willing to put in the effort.",coursereport

No location-based job assistance Satisfying: My tutor was top-notch--quick to answer questions and review work. The course does a good job presenting the material for a career-changer--I learned a lot! The Career Advisors are knowledgable and helpful. Very supportive community on Slack I was a little sad after finishing the course because I enjoyed my time as a student. The course format is great when working full-time.

The price was affordable, and if you aren't looking for something that will land you six figures straight out the gates, this is a great program. I was looking to add to existing skills vs learning a whole new career, and the course provided what I needed. Pros: Price tag, great overview ""start-to-finish,"" Cons: Course materials were mostly written, some lessons basically tell you what to do vs finding a way to make you think and find a solution, tutor/mentor feedback was often the same, telling me what to do vs giving me a tiny hint and allowing me to find the answers, difficult time connecting with other students (this is likely inherent of ANY online program, not specific to CF).",coursereport
1778,Careerfoundry,2018-03-05,"I recently completed CareerFoundry’s 6 month UI/UX course and received a job offer about 3 months afterwards. It enabled me to achieve my goal of changing my career trajectory. I was already working as a traditional graphic designer, but had been wanting to do more UX/UI work and CF helped make that a reality. I was so pleased from beginning to end. The course is very well laid-out and paced appropriately. I worked hard, but was able to complete it while still working full time. Expect a minimum of 15hrs each week, more if you want to get the most out of it. It was worth every penny. CF pairs you with 2 mentors, one who you work with weekly, and another who reviews your final unit assignments, of which there are about 6. This pairing works really well so that you get multiple viewpoints. They also have numerous active slack channels setup for student communication which really help if you take advantage of them. It was always great to get feedback from students around the globe. I live in New Jersey, USA, but often communicated with students on the opposite side of the globe. I also like that CF is constantly re-evaluating the course and making tweaks to improve it. The tail end of the course is set up towards completing your online portfolio, which is really key. It is not an afterthought, or something you are left to do on your own. That alone is priceless. I went back and forth with each mentor honing it, along with my resume, until I felt it was “ready” to show to prospective employers. It paid off. Once my portfolio was ready, CF has many job placement specialists who help you prepare and also have industry contacts. They were able to connect me with a few NYC firms and I was off and running.

1779,Careerfoundry,2018-02-22,"It's now been more than six months since I went through the UI Design course and I can honestly say that I totally regret it. Although the instructors were great, the curriculum and the job assistance left a lot to be desired. First for the good. You are assigned a tutor and a mentor. The tutor looks at your smaller projects and gives you feedback and the mentor gives you detailed feedback on the larger projects. My tutor and mentor were both great. They gave me a lot of helpful feedback and I learned a lot about design from both of them. The written curriculum was another matter. It was badly written and hard to read. I had to read it out loud to follow what was written (not typical for me) and I had to rewrite a lot of the sentences to make them make any sense. There were a great many typos throughout which was, I think, a large part of the reason the text was hard to read. Both the UI Course and the Career Course desperately needed to be checked by an editor and a proofreader. The job assistance was the worst part of the course. At the time I went through they said they would help you find a job you love within six months or they would refund your money. They seem to have amended that to just ""find a job"" since then which is probably for the best, especially if they have the same career advisors now that they had when I finished the course. My advisor basically told me it was unrealistic for me to get a job that I loved and that I would have to settle for something I probably wouldn't much like. I ended up switching to another career advisor who was less gloomy but she was not anymore helpful. I am chronically ill so I need to work remotely. They weren't able to help me find remote work or to offer any guidance for finding freelance work. The only advice the career advisor offered for finding a freelance job was that I should know how long it takes me to finish a project so that I can offer a time estimate to clients. I knew that already anyway, but she didn't offer me any help or guidance for freelance work other than that. I would not recommend that someone take this course if they think they'll actually need help getting a job. If you live in a big city or can relocate, it might be all right, but if you're like me and need to work from home they won't help you. They also have things set up so you probably can't get your money back. I wish I could. I regret taking the course. It did not help me to get any sort of job and I could really use the money I spent on their course because I'm broke. If you are in a good position to get a job already, they might be okay, but if you need help finding a career, look elsewhere. They may well just drop you as soon as you complete the course work the way that they dropped me.",coursereport

I was already super happy with course immediately after finishing it, however the cherry on the top was the career specialists' advice AFTER the course. I could always reach out to them and get an answer, or an appointment for a skype call / mock interview within a few days. Their advice was actionable and super helpful. I think, this is what makes the course different to others in the end. Only a few weeks after finishing the course I started working for a Design Agency, that I had dreamed of working for in about 3 years time.",coursereport
1785,Careerfoundry,2018-01-27,"I’m a Creative Development Specialist in Global Product Development at eBay and work with developers and engineers on a daily basis. Since I don’t have a CS background I wanted to use this course for understanding Web Development better and be able to facilitate this understanding in my job. The course provided a good opportunity to dive into Web Dev through a concrete project, which was challenging but also fun. My tutor provided superb support and patient explanations on every topic, that needed further elaboration. I’m happy I took the course and would recommend it to anyone, who would like to deepen their knowledge in this exciting field. However, if you want to start a job in Web Dev, this course wouldn’t be enough and some more practice would be necessary. It provides a good starting point though and you can learn a lot, if you are willing to do some research and exercises on your own. I didn't take the ""Job preparation"" course, so I can't evaluate the Job Assistance.",coursereport
1786,Careerfoundry,2018-01-20,"I come from a design background having studied Graphic Design in university and having 4 years of web design under my belt, however I wanted a career refresh so that I could move from websites to user experience design within the mobile app industry without having to go in at a junior position. After taking the User Interface Design course last year I am now in an amazing role as a mid-weight UX designer at the UKs leading mobile app company. I am currently the sole designer on a number of app projects and I get to work alongside talented project managers, strategy managers and iOS/Android developers. The company takes UX seriously so alongside UI design I am learning loads about UX and strategy and I will be helping facilitate a week long client design sprint within the next couple of months (using the Jake Knapp methodology). I have come so far since starting the course, I would never have dreamt I’d be in this position less than a year into studying so I just want to say a big thanks to everyone on the team at Career Foundry! Although I didn’t get the chance to finish the course, it gave me all the skills I needed to move from web design into the mobile app and UX industries. I would recommened this course for anyone who already has some design background or talent, who has a passion for problem solving and user experience.",coursereport
1787,Careerfoundry,2018-01-12,"Overall, I really enjoyed the UI Course. It helped me boost up and round out the UX experience I already have under my belt. The classes/modules were comprehensive and challenging. By the end of the course I felt confident that I could market myself as more than just a designer who was limited to wireframes and site maps. Now I have a whole host of other skillsets that help design an entire website/app from soup to nuts.",coursereport
1788,Careerfoundry,2017-12-09,"I personally like the UX Bootcamp at CareerFoundry. At the beginning, I was hesitated to enroll this program for many reasons. Because of its 100% online course, I wasn’t sure how the school would navigate Graduated students for their future careers. However, at the end of this road, I knew I made the right decision. A couple things I want to point out that I think might be helpful for the future students. For those who have a design background may found it’s very light contents at the beginning but think in this way - this is where you can speed up. I do think the curriculum laid out is well-design and effective - getting challenging more and more as you go along. I got a great mentor, he has been super helpful. His feedbacks and suggestions help me get a clear understanding of many “whys”. Help me to develop a mindset and ability to empower my skills. Danielle is amazing! She is a career specialist here. She helped me when I graduated with all the resources, everything you need to prepare and get done if you need to succeed in your career. I had many interviews right after but I still enjoy learning, so I paused for a while to continue learning, develop skillsets, and get connections. Not for long, I achieve my goal - get a job I love. Overall, it’s an excellent course. I would recommend for anyone who is interested in getting started in UX Design. All you need to do is just to set you mind believing in the program, make a commitment and believing in yourself!",coursereport
1789,Careerfoundry,2017-12-02,"I really enjoyed my time going through the program. Right out the gate I was introduced to my tutor who helped sharpen the quality of my work throughout each exercise. She offered Skype calls whenever I wanted, which I took advantage of with my most challenging assignments. The video reviews my mentor sent were instructive and the 1-on-1’s are mainly what you want them to be, so be prepared to ensure you make the most of them. CareerFoundry has an excellent community. Fellow students are active on slack, always sharing, and there's certainly a spirit of participation. Seeing others progress spurred me on too. CF staff reach out often and are a vibrant bunch. I interacted with a lot of awesome people beyond my tutor and mentor. This also increased my level of engagement. The coursework itself was good and helped me develop solid design skills. Each task has examples of previously approved work which gives additional perspective. I will say that some of the article links seemed a bit outdated (a few were 2+ years old) but CF was working on refreshing this material. After receiving my certification I started working with my career specialist who is very resourceful. I spent the majority of the 6 months after graduation developing my portfolio which took away from applying. Know upfront you should have at least 3 projects to be considered a viable candidate. I ended up recently accepting a new job in the tech field that I wouldn’t have been able to get without this course. UX plays a big role with any company and these skills are applicable anywhere. CareerFoundry is a great place to learn it and live it!",coursereport
1790,Careerfoundry,2017-11-30,"I completed the UI Design Course with Career Foundry in August, and got a job 2 month later. I really liked the flexibility of the class, exclusively online and self-paced. I also liked being able to communicate with real humans at the same time (my mentor and tutors) to answer questions. The one area where they could improve according to me is to provide a better consistency in the quality of the classes (they were not all equivalent in quality of content and deliverables to provide)",coursereport

My confidence as a designer has excelled exponentially with the help of the CF Curriculum, Team and Mentors. Thanks for all the support !",coursereport
1792,Careerfoundry,2017-11-27,"One year ago I decided to give a try to Careerfoundry online Web Development course. After a few presential courses and some all over the place self study, I decided to try something more structured than my own program and more modern than the previous classrom intake. My major concern though was the kind of support I'd receive and how to proceed when I got stuck. It turns out that I had the best feedback ever and the tutor and mentor know in so much depth what they are teaching. To not mention how quick they are. You usually wait 1-2 days for an assessment review and you can also schedule calls. I do think the course doesn't go into enough depth into JS and Ruby, to be honest, but it already took me nearly 8 months to conciliate work and studies. So overall it has a good balance. I'd strongly recomment this course to anyone willing to start a career as web developer but keep in mind to go further in all the links and extra material your tutor provides. The carrer specialist were also great and helped me to tailor my resume and get more confident for interviews. As I was putting some of the course skills on my marketing and social media job since the beginning of the year, I had some sort of experience in the eyes of the marketing but not much, what was decisive were the code challenges and I was able to do them all until I found the perfect match 2 months ago.",coursereport
1793,Careerfoundry,2017-11-27,"Career Foundry's UI Designer course helped me to up skill is some key areas where I need some help. As a designer with 8 years commercial experience I was unsure whatelse I would learn. But, I was wrong. The course structure is designed for someone who has no 'design' expereince so the early course content was a little limiting. But as the course progressed learning new software and applying design patterns to mobile interfaces was inspiring and worthwhile. The tutors are friendly and helpful and my mentor pushed me to succeed. The online community are very supportive and I found each student wanted to help and assist eachother. The only CON I would have is that the UI course is predominatly mobile app focussed. This was fine for me as I wnated more expereince in this area. But the course content is less aimed at desktop and tablet, if this is what you are wanting. I did found it difficult to juggle full time work and a young family around my studies. This could be down to my time management but I found the length of course content challenging. Full time workers beware.",coursereport
1794,Careerfoundry,2017-11-20,"The decision to depart from my 11 year long career in Marketing to become a UI designer was not one i took lightly but was without doubt one i will never regret. It's one year since i began my UI Design course and since completing the course just under four months ago, i have managed to secure a number of paid UI/UX design roles and just last week a full time designer position in a well respected UK digital design agency. I am delighted i chose Career Foundry as my course provider and enjoyed every minute of the course. The format of the teaching and lessons were well crafted, the projects challenging but fulfilling and the general UX of the online course was great. One of the best parts however, was the tutors and mentors. My tutor was extremely helpful and marked all work in a timely manner. My mentor, Muwuso an very experienced designer by far exceeded my expectations in his mentoring role providing me with consistently valuable feedback, insights and suggestions and continously inspired me in my journey both throughout the course and onwards. He was generous enough to support me in my search for a job even once i had completed my certificate and we are still in touch. I cant communicate enough how important his mentoring influence had on me.",coursereport
1795,Careerfoundry,2017-11-19,"I researched many many courses and even signed up for a few, but they did not have the level of detail or proffessionalism I needed. I got an amazing tutor and she encouraged me to develop the course in a direction I wanted to best suite my requirements. Skype calls were really the best and quickest ways to develop ideas and go through feedback, also my tutor Olga went the extra mile and always encouraged me to email her any time I got stuck. My partner is now doing the UX course and I have the confidnce that she will complete it being ready for the change of career she desires. Expensive, but really, it's worth it in the grand scheme of things.",coursereport

The course material was excellent and I gained many new skills over the 7 months. What made this course highly valuable to me is the interaction I had with my mentor, tutor, and career advisors. At the end of the course, I felt confident in my skills and abilities, and was excited about moving forward in the UX industry. Most importantly, I was successful in getting my first UX job at a well-known company! Overall, this course was worth every penny. I learned a lot, enjoyed interacting and receiving feedback from mentors and peers, and got a job in UX!",coursereport

I was really pleased with the experience - the material was well written and easy to follow, and I liked completing the tasks at the end of each unit. My instructor took the time to give me constructive feedback during our sessions that I feel really helped me apply what I was learning in a practical way. I think the focus on creating a portfolio-ready piece by the end of the course set me up for success and helped me showcase my skills to potential employers. I'm now a full time product designer and very happy with my experience with CareerFoundry.",coursereport
1798,Careerfoundry,2017-10-24,"I am now 2 months of 3 into the Web Developer course from Careerfoundry. You get daily text lessons for which you have to submit exercises at the end which are then revised/approved by a Tutor. At the end of each chapter you have to submit one project which is video reviewed by a Mentor. You also get a total of 4 Skype calls with the Mentor. The first part of the course you work on a single page portfolio with HTML, CSS, JavaScript & jQuery. The second part is learning Ruby on Rails and creating an ecommerce app. First of all, the lessons themselves are limited and short, and not always easy. They can serve like the thread to climb along but won't be helping you enough by themselves. You do spend most of your time researching the internet and learning from outeside sources. I myself am enrolled in 2 other Rails courses in the internet, which are cheaper and explain the Ruby on Rails framework better. So why this course? Well, the good part ist that you have a Tutor at your availablility which can help you out if you get stuck or have questions. My Tutor is quite available and really knows his way around Rails, so I am quite happy with it. My Mentor is also really professional and his video reviews are always very helpful. All in all it does motivate you to keep going and that is something that helps many people to not give up. A part where the course is lacking is the student community. You actually don't have any contact with your fellow students. There are some Slack channels but they are not very well visited because it is not enforced. Which is a pity because collaboration and team work are important parts of being a developer, too. There is a commenting system on the lessons where students can ask questions about the course, but 99% are not answered so you are better off just asking your poor Tutor. I think in this area, the course could improve and enforce the students to help each other out more. Additionally it would be great if someone would take care of those student questions, which sometimes arise due to unclear or outdated course material. The course comes also with a ""Job Prep"" course, which is supposed to help you change careers. I have not finished that part of the course yet, but what I have seen of it is indeed helpful. I feel that the idea of the course is really great and that it you can access it with a ""Bildungsgutschein"" is wonderful. But there are areas where the course could really improve, like the student community, and the lessons could be revised a bit more often. Finally, I personally don't think that the course is worth 3500€, but that is really my opinion, as I would expect a little more for that money. But it can help you to become a Rails Developer if you really fully dedicate yourself to it and use other courses and start your own projects soon - and it is a wonderful alternative to other courses that are available with a ""BIldungsgutschein"" - so my review is still 4 of 5 stars.",coursereport
1799,Careerfoundry,2017-10-21,"CareerFoundry was definitely one of the best trainings I have done in my life. Indeed, I received on top of the skills acquired during the course some proper coaching from my mentor Darren (thanks again mate!) and the super friendly career advisors. What I enjoyed a lot is that my experience as a student was outstanding before, during and after the course. Indeed, CareerFoundry is not only teaching UX but really embed those human-centric principles into every single touch point with its customers and stakeholders. This is a true inspiration for me on how UX can be applied at scale within an organisation and its ecosystem. Of course the program in UX design was for me the beginning of my learning journey as I continued to upgrade my skills in disciplines such as UI design, service design or even coding long after the class was over. But the course helped me to find my true calling and to gain confidence in my abilities to drive a UX project from the brief to the final delivery. When taking the class I worked as a business developer for a Fintech company, I now work as a business designer for the innovation department of Nordea, the leading bank in the Nordics. My work consists at leading innovation project from facilitating workshops, prototyping interface or services to testing with customers. I still apply the UX process I learned during the course to the projects I run on a weekly basis.",coursereport
1800,Careerfoundry,2017-10-18,"I enrolled the UX design course in December 2016 and finished in August 2017. I had a basic knowledge of design and psychology from my previous jobs, but I was totally new to a tech field. At the beginning, I easily and often got overwhelmed because there were so many things to learn. I wasn't sure if I could finish the course. It was not easy and very challenging. But more I learned, more I enjoyed, and eventually my anxiety disappeared. I am sure I couldn't have completed the course without the help of my very passionate and encouraging tutor, and very precise and perceptive mentors. There are still lots of things that the course doesn't cover and I have to learn on my own. But I felt I was quite ready to start my career as a UX designer after completing the course. Following the advice from the awesome career specialists, I updated my resume and LinkedIn, and a few days later a design director from a digital healthcare company got in touch with me asking if I'm interested in a UI/UX designer role, and eventually I got the job! Even though it's an online course, I got to know very inspiring people such as my tutor, mentors, career specialists, other students etc... and I will be in touch with them for sure! Taking the UX course was definitely one of the best choices I made in my life :)",coursereport

Because there are some many websites, blogs and free courses out there, I didn't know where to begin. That's why I choose to follow a UX course at Careerfoundry. I hated going to university: studying books and writing papers was very boring to me. However, I love the UX Fundamentals course in Careerfoundry because you can start building up your portfolio right away. The exercises are hands-on, very practical and exciting! I really appreciate the help from my tutor and mentor, as they always gives me helpful and motivating feedback. What I like the most is that I can immediately start using my new skills in my current job. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in UX!",coursereport
1802,Careerfoundry,2017-08-25,"Very dissatisfied with the Student Advisory team. More of that later. The course is tough! Taking up more time than expected but I'm progressing and on track to finish on time. If you're a beginner like me, treat this as a full-time course. You may find it difficult to stay on track if you devote only 20 hours/week. One thing I do not like is the excessive amount of links the lessons throw at me. Ruins my flow. I'd spend a bunch of time finally understanding a section, go on to the next section and get links to read up on other stuff. This happens a lot and pretty much in every lesson. It's overwhelming. Hard to determine which links are important and which ones I can save for later. If I were to go through each link, it would take forever to complete the course. Not ideal for a beginner programmer. Intermediate or Advanced, okay. But I'm not gonna read through all this stuff. I would have liked something more streamlined. My tutor is okay. He responds to my lesson submissions within 24-48 hours. Maybe on 1-2 occasions, past 48 hours. If I'm stuck and send him a direct message, he'll respond in a couple of hours. 24 hours the latest. Good luck if you have a PC. It's hard to progress once you get on Achievement 3, Ruby. Easier if you have a Mac or Dual boot Ubuntu. Tutor wasn't able to help me with my PC problems so I ended up having to take my Mac out of storage to continue on with the course. Not a lot of activity on the CF message boards. A lot of questions go unanswered. I might get better success on Slack but I don't see a lot of students posting lesson specific questions so I never bothered. From what I've seen, most of the posts on Slack are for career placement. My mentor knows his stuff well. Hesitant to reach out to him, however, as he's very busy. He's a contractor for Career Foundry and I was encouraged to reach out to him on Slack only when it is urgent or if I'm really stuck on something. He also didn't sound too confident when I asked if he can help me get up and running on Achievement 3 using a PC. He said he'd try his best. I opted to just get my Mac out of storage. Our communication, for the most part, is via webchat. I have about 8 sessions(up to an hour) total. I need to have a list of questions prior to each session to make the most out of them. Outside of these webchats, it's tough to send quick questions. I'm basically on my own. They highly encourage Google and Stack Overflow to solve your own problems and only reach out to your tutor/mentor when you absolutely need it. Since they take up to 24 hours to respond to you and not much activity on the message boards, it's hard to get a quick answer. The course is ideal for intermediate/advanced programmers but for a beginner who needs a little extra hand holding, I feel the human element is strongly lacking. This brings me to the Student Advisory team. These are the guys you reach out to if you have general questions, concerns, requests for tutor/mentor replacement, etc. I'd like to compare the student advisor I was paired up with to that of a robot. This person felt that copying/pasting blocks of text to answer my questions was sufficient correspondence. Questions were only partially answered. I complained about it and another advisor volunteered to replace her when I considered dropping out of the course for a full refund. I believe you have a week or two to back out before you are financially committed. The thing is, once I agreed to stick with CF and knew I wouldn't get a refund on what I currently paid, the replacement advisor stopped answering my emails. It's funny, the only genuine conversations I've had with anyone throughout this experience were with the sales rep when she was selling it to me and the replacement student advisor who assured me I wouldn't have to go through the same frustrations I've experienced with the first advisor when I was thinking of getting a refund. When money is involved, I know they would put in their best effort to address your concerns. After that, you better be lucky you're paired with a good advisor, tutor, and mentor. In my personal experience, I've observed that CareerFoundry is driven most by revenue and will put in a minimal effort into my growth and development and a web programmer. I haven't started on the job placement portion of the course yet. I'm only halfway done. Don't need to wait, however, to complete the course to write this review. I've already formed my opinion of CareerFoundry. They get 1 star for the overall experience, but I'll add an extra star because I am learning(ever so slowly) and for the job guarantee.",coursereport
1803,Careerfoundry,2017-08-23,"This course is really worth your time and investment. I was a COMPLETE beginner with a small tech anxiety too, so it was a challenge for me even see myself as a competent member of the tech industry. Of course, the imposter syndrome is still there and will stay for a while, but I cannot deny myself the huge progress I've made since the beginning of the course. It is all down to my tutor/mentor team, honestly. They were so patient, helpful and knowledgeable, that I learned a huge deal from them. No task was ever approved just, so I get pushed along - NO, even if one took me weeks, it had to be on a great level for them to accept it. That's what I wanted, I don't want to finish a course and still have no idea what I'm doing - I put in the work, they gave me their attention and perfection seeking attitude. I genuinely felt like I'm seeing online products with completely different eyes, notice things that I've always taken for granted and seeing the difference between the good and not-so-good UX design. The curriculum is great, easy to understand and presented in a non-techy language, so I was not confused at all, yet learned everything I needed to know (including the properly explained tech lingo). You get to use industry standard software that makes you feel confident about entering a workplace. Staff is super helpful, friendly and positive. Even though I haven't yet finished the course, I can see that the career team is very active and full of energy to help me find a job as much as they possibly can. I talked to a career advisor once already and had a great session, I can do that as much as I want with CF, whenever I need some advice or say an interview prep session. They are like energy volcanos with a passion for getting things done. There is simply nothing I can think of that I was not very impressed with and you can trust me, I'm not easy to please ;) HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",coursereport

I will especially miss the indepth, encouraging, timely and constructive feedback I've been receiving from my tutor, Henrietta Creedy.

My mentor was always open to give me advice, critic my work so I can enhance my skills and also there were 12 calls available which was awesome. After finishing my course I got my first job as a UI Designer in just 1 month and about 2 weeks. They have some career specialist you can contact so they help you on your job hunting. Honestly CareerFoundry is growing and for now, I think is the best online tech school. Before enrolling I look for others courses and curriculums and the most completed and interesting was that one.

Being very creatively-minded since young, I think I had a strong advantage when it came to studying this course and finishing it in 4 months. It covers the fundamentals of (UI) design as well as UX in order to start working in this field. You'll finish with a solid portfolio, however, after I completed the course I still created a few more projects to add a bit more diversity to mine. The Career Change Achievement helps in refining your CV, cover letter template and in general prepares you for entering the job market, but I think this is where you have to do most of the legwork. I haven't seen many job opportunities come directly from the career placement team, but I've been busy applying for jobs myself over the past two weeks or so since finishing. I've had two promising interviews so far with another tomorrow, and I'm confident that I will have a full-time job shortly.",coursereport

1809,Careerfoundry,2017-05-08,"I started with my Certified UX Designer Program in February. I was a bit concerned since I work full-time and the program requires aprx. 15 hours per week. But so far, it works perfectly. I managed to have two dedicated days per week to study in the evening and a half day at the weekend. So far, I am in time and had not to skip a social event. The class itself is super much fun although it is very challening. I am working as a customer relationship manager, so I know a bit of the topic, but there is so much to learn that I would have never expected before. It is interesting because of very good written texts, links and great examples to get further information, but no videos. When I was at University, I studied history, so I am used to dealing with a lot of text. Therefore for me the style of learning is perfect. Content-wise I do learn a lot about design theories, flows, how to sort and structure thoughts and insights, as well as to present my findings. The programm is sheduled in doable lessons. One takes me an evening or sometimes more, when I have to shedule interviews or other appointments. My tutor gives me extremely detailed feedback, much more then I expected.

1810,Careerfoundry,2017-04-28,"I felt it was necessary to put this up here as CareerFoundry has done a whole lot in the last four months that needs to be recognized so future students can get an inside look at how well the school is progressing. I started just a few months ago and prior I was extremely skeptical being within the UX community for quite a few month prior to that. I got the chance to give CF's completely new curriculum and school a go as one of the first students to hit the ground running when they released it. So far I am extremely happy with everything and couldnt have made a better choice looking back at the anxiety I had choosing a school. I have a wonderful Mentor and Tutor who support me the entire way and have different jobs when it comes to making sure I succeed. The community on Slack is wonderful and you always feel like you have other students by your side as if you were going to normal college. The course is well laid out and definitely not easy, you need to put your head down and dig right in to make sure you are getting 120% out of all the material they provide as there is an abundance of information you get on every topic along with assignments, direct feedback and skype calls from your tutor and mentor. The layout is well planned and visually beautiful as well as they just updated the look and feel again of the course which has made it easier to navigate and see your progress. The biggest skeptiscism I had with all the UX and UI bootcamps was job placement. This is something that I know for many people feels like a safety net almost if your coming from a unrelated field and making a leap of faith. CF has a full blown team dedicated to not only working with you on job placement at the end, but from day one you'll see specialist hanging out in Slack getting involved in the community with different events like portfolio challenges or local meetups and special holiday events. This really intrigued me when I first saw it because not once in the past have I EVER seen involvement like this from a career team. I could talk to any of them about anything from accountability meetups to improving my resume. Super useful! I could go on for hours about other things that have pleasently surprised me with CF but I dont want to waste anyones time here. All in all 5/5 for CF. The experience has been wonderful and I look forward to continuing and finishing my journey as a student with them!",coursereport

I'm really happy to be part of such a talented community of designers. If someone out there is interested to give it a try here is a promo link that discounts $200 usd from any of the programs CF have: http://mbsy.co/careerfoundry/28708517",coursereport

They won't let you slide by if it's not good enough. There were definitely a lot of late nights and it's a grind to stay on top of things if you work full time. It's manageable though if you use your time wisely. I definitely reccomend this for anyone interested in UX. There is also a lot of UI learning in the course, as well.",coursereport
1813,Careerfoundry,2017-02-15,"I started the UX Design course that CareerFoundry offers back in August. My background is BA & Marketing and I was kind of scared if I would be able to finish on time and follow the material. Six months later I have to say that I'm absolutely happy with the course, the tasks you had to do and most importantly the mentor I had. She was great! She poitned me out in the right direction, giving me feedback on time and answering all of my questions timely and fully. If you work at the same time (like I did), you have to be ready to give up most of your spare time and be dedicated and willing to work as it's a new career path and there are many new things to learn. Other than that CF provides all the tools someone needs to excel! After the course they also provide further help to assist you with landing your first job. :)",coursereport

It’s a great kickstart for a career change as you learn the whole process of UX while designing an web application and not only reading. As a complete beginner coming from Graphic Design i really had to put some effort but it worth it all the way. Having a full time job and a family while studying was hard sometimes but i never felt alone there. Support team did a fantastic job and they even offered to me 3 weeks for free to complete my course after having some issues with a few assignments. And finally i had a great mentor, Gökcen Keskin, whose feedback really helped me to design the app better and motivated me for taking the right decisions.",coursereport

I must say, I was looking for a course that would outline design phases and decisions, clear up and bring into structure all that enourmous overwhelming information I saw in the web. Lucky for me, I had a great mentor Allison Yaeger. Her critical thinking, down-to-earth attitude together with positive personality both challeneged me and encouraged me to revisit my decisions, iterate on my designs. Moreover I received great feedback on my portfolio, and recommendations on how to handle interviews and market myself. It helped me to land an Interaction Designer job in IceMobile, one of the best employers in the Netherlands. I higly recommend the course with such a professional mentor to anyone, who wants to start UX career.",coursereport

1820,Careerfoundry,2017-01-06,CareerFoundry definitely helped me to grow in my technical skills as a designer. Their course helped me to familiarize myself with common design tools that are used in the industry. The various projects and student community was helpful to expand my skills and to gain feedback. I enjoyed the mentorship CareerFoundry offered as well. My mentor was always open and willing to talk and flexible with times. She gave me great and helpful feedback and helped to challenge me in learning other tools and thinking about different ways to design.,coursereport
1821,Careerfoundry,2017-01-06,"I'm almost finished with the UI design course and I can't emphasize enough how glad I am I took the leap and committed to a bootcamp. Here are some pros and cons: Pros: -The course is self paced. -The readings and assignments focus on real world application. Each task builds on the last and suddenly, viola, you've designed an app (actually several)! -My mentor was great. We connected through Skype and email and she was okay with it when at one point, life happened and I had to take several weeks off. I even asked her to be more critical of my work and she was! (That may sound silly but I really really want a design job and I thrive under a healthy amount of feedback!!) -My mentor also had me tailor my assignments to my larger projects. The result was that I often had to do a little more work but it also meant that I got a glimpse of real problems that come up in the design process and as a result, I feel more confident applying for jobs. -The job placement team! I've never had someone help me apply for jobs. So that's neat. Cons: -Now that I'm job hunting I see that most UI jobs require you to have some basic HTML/CSS/ or JavaScript knowledge. I wish this was covered in the course. I know that there are a lot of free resources out there for this but having a project to focus on and a mentor to call on would be helpful. -The job placement team can be a little hard to get ahold of. I have several working with me so I can usually get ahold of someone but getting ahold of the same one can take time.",coursereport
1822,Careerfoundry,2017-01-05,"Coming to CareerFoundry with prior UX design experience I thought it would help me take my UX skills to the next level. I feel my CareerFoundry tutor (Abhishek Bhattacharya) and mentor (Leah Simmons) did a fantastic job showing me where I excelled and what areas I could improve in. As most of the class material was not necessarily new to me, I really appreciated the enthusiasm demonstrated by Leah engaging me in critical discussions on how to realign my methods to better meet user needs. She was high energy and generous with her time. I found the class very easy and was able to complete it in a 3 month period while working a 50+ hour job. I would simply state that this program is not only great for newbies but individuals who might have been working in the field for a while and want to enhance their skills.

I definitely recommend this course to anyone looking for a career change.",coursereport
1824,Careerfoundry,2016-12-16,"I am still working through the course but I am enjoying it a lot. I like that we are immediately starting to learn things that are useful and applicable in building a web application, rather than starting from very basic and boring things, or outdated technologies, like it usually is in formal education like university. Also the community part is great, I can always ask for help my Mentor or my Tutor and also ask questions to other students. Sometimes it takes time for them to answer and in the meantime I find the answer by myself which is also great. I am looking forward to do more of backend stuff and to complete my portfolio.",coursereport
1825,Careerfoundry,2016-12-16,"For the most part, I enjoyed the Web Developer course. It was challenging at times -- mostly toward the end. The curriculum was decent. The part that really made this course stand out was/is the community of not only helpful alumni, but how students helped/help other students. Having that in a real-time environment was/is great. As an alumnus, I still help students whenever possible. Additionally, having both an assigned tutor and mentor was great. Mine were very helpful and offered great suggestions as well as being able to point me the right direction to resolve issues for which I just could not find the answers. Having that kind of support system really made the course less frustrating. Although the course was good, there is definitely room for improvement. First of all, I would not recommend this course to a complete beginner. If you have even basic HTML and CSS knowledge, then go for it. However, if you only know HTML and CSS because you heard a geeky friend talk about it, then I would go elsewhere to learn the basics. I, and many others, have helped too many struggling and inexperienced students get through the first few lessons because they were confused about what they needed to do. Secondly, I believe there should have been more practice with Javascript and an introduction to a newer framwork like Angular, React, or Node as opposed to jQuery. I say that because when I went job-hunting after the course, all of the job postings wanted experience in more, some several more, languages and/or frameworks and the three that I listed seem to be the most popular. Adding at least one of them to the course would give students something more in-demand to add to their resume and portfolio. Thirdly, I don't think Ruby and Ruby on Rails are good choices for students to learn right now simply because most of the jobs out there want a lot of experience and most are for senior positions. Students are hoping to take the course and get in the field as fast as possible and I don't believe the short amount of time to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails is sufficient -- especially if the student has little to no programming experience. Finally, there are parts of the course where the wording was just outright confusing. However, that is not all bad since the student has the ability to notify the staff and let them know about things like that, which they are pretty good about resolving quickly. With all that said, I still had a good experience and made some friends and acquaintances. There is also the added benefit that the course lessons are still available even after you have graduated as well as continued access to the community. Also, they do offer resume assistance and try to help you find a job. Still, I believe with the right combination of web development languages and frameworks, more students may find positions as a web developer faster.",coursereport
1826,Careerfoundry,2016-12-15,"CF team has developed a great tool online, defiant most of the time and designed to increase difficulty lesson after lesson. System provide you a great feed back and a big picture of your progress. Tutor and mentor system works good, answers comes fast enough (could be better) and in a clearly way. They use links to useful resources and some times use video answers, showing you where and how you can improve you work. One of the most valuables things is the community (I did not take it as it should, to be honest) but allways you find useful info, support and a friendly network of people, a really important aspect of being web developer!",coursereport
1827,Careerfoundry,2016-12-14,"...that my course is over. I mean it. I did the Web Dev course and finished it in 2 1/2 month. That's pretty fast and although I hadn't much free time (let's say none) I definitely can say every minute was worth it. Here's why: Course content Before I joined the course I did some free courses on codecademy which was great. At least most of the time. You get an exercise, write your code in the given editor and get your review right away. So far so good. BUT: Did you really learn something? I'm not sure about that. You don't have to install your own text editor. You don't have to install Ruby, Rails and so on. Yes, it might feel a lot easier but what for? I think, IF you really want to learn a language you have to fail and you have to read and google and make stackoverflow to your new facebook. That doesn't mean you shouldn't use free sources in addition. ;) I liked it a lot how the content of CareerFoundry is written. And whenever I thought something was wrong (like I didn't get an expected output) there's a review at the end of each task where you can submit your notes. I only used it once and they reached back to me nearly immediately. Plus there's a lot of advice where to find further information. All you have to do is to read and try. Sure though, in three months it can be really, really tough. But it can be done. Mentor Video Reviews The first review felt strange to me. Someone else - a human being I actually saw on my screen - went through my code and checked my assignment. That's even like sitting in school and the teacher corrects your work. Scary but oh so helpful. And I was really happy with my mentor who gave me a lot of advice and who had a passion for good-looking code. Community I can hardly imagine a life without Slack. And how was it possible to communicate without? You have channels for all kind of stuff. For Web Development in general, for taskhelp, for feedback, for UX, UI, for everything. And the best of it? You'll get an answer. Sure, sometimes you have to wait for an answer but keep in mind - there are 24 different time zones. Not everyone is awake when you are. I'm so glad that I've ""met"" another student I could learn with. We struggled at the same tasks and it felt like sitting next to each although we studied in different cities. Tip: Say hello at the beginning of your course and find someone you can interchange with! Sometimes you just need a second look to find a missing semicolon. Course Access I did the course in this short time period because I had to. Circumstances forced me to do so and although I wish there would have been more time for the tasks I feel confident with HTML, CSS, Ruby, Rails, ... I did an internship after the course (Web Development, Ruby on Rails) and I can tell you that although there's a lot I still have to learn, I felt good. Yes I needed way more time compared to the Web Devs in the company but I never felt lost. And regarding the bullet point above this paragraph ""Course Access"", you have it (the content) the rest of your life. So whenever I struggled, I not only used google and forums, I used my course and asked the community for help. Conclusion I would do it again. And I can recommend it allover!",coursereport

I think that, because I am receiving great support not only from my tutor and my mentor, but also from the other students and the people, who are working at Career Foundry. There are different communication channels where I can reach out for help, if I get stuck somewhere with a lesson. The curriculum is packed full with both front-end and back-end, which I find really awesome to learn so much and especially different topics. Only I am glad that I have seen some lines of code before, otherwise I would probably be lost a lot of times.

I’ve just finished up the UI Design course and am much more confident about my skills than when I tried to learn on my own. While I was researching various different online schools, I ended up choosing CF because it was actually a course I could afford. I’ll admit, I was a bit skeptical of the quality of the lessons at their price point, but I was pleasantly surprised. I was paired with an amazing mentor that challenged my designs and pushed me to keep working past projects that were just “good enough”. That combined with a very supportive staff and fellow students really helped me to succeed in the course. After six months, I’ve gone from having little to no information about how to design an app to having several full prototypes to add to my portfolio.

1834,Careerfoundry,2016-11-07,"When I joined CareerFoundry, I didn't even know what a code was. I was a true defination of the word ""beginner"". What made me enrol with them was the desire to learn. Anxious as I was about the course, the fact that I will have a tutor and a mentor put a bit of ease. And true to their words, my tutor was heaven sent. He was there for me every step of the way. He would always remind me that it was his job to help me so I must always ask if I need help. As for my mentor, he understood that I was a beginner and he really encouraged me to work hard to achieve my career goals. The Curriculum is detailed with additional material to educate yourself even further than the given tasks. It is hard work but at the end of each task, there is joy that comes with it. You are never alone when learning with CF, the community is always there for you. Be it the support team, student advisors or other students, the support is just ovewhelming.

1836,Careerfoundry,2016-11-01,"Online education is not for everyone, and it can be very hard to find an organization that can effectively convey useful information and help establish a skill set. That said, Career Foundry does an excellent job at taking someone (such as myself) with little, to no UI design background and points them in the right direction. Career Foundry helps establish a knowledge base that makes that ""where do I even start?"" feeling, much more manageable. A word of warning, if you are new to UI, this course will not be easy. The first few months I was able to keep up and even get considerably ahead of my scheduled end date. However, you have to keep pressing throughout the whole course because it gets particularly demanding towards the end. You will likely spend around 7-10 hours a week for the first couple of months. Towards the end of the course, however, I was logging 20 hours or more a week. So you will definitely do a good amount of work. The staff is professional and excellent to work with. Responses come quick considering different time-zones and the fact you depend a lot on emailing. Cicely was particularly great to work with. You can tell she takes her job very seriously and she always responds in a timely manner. My mentor Eric was also awesome! We had around 8 or so conversations and he was always able to spot mistakes I hadn't noticed, or he brought things to my attention that could be improved upon. Initially, I may have had some pushback to some of his suggestions, but far more often than not they ended up improving upon what I had originally built. He was also very quick about getting back to me and offering feedback. If you are looking to become a certified pro on Sketch and are even remotely interested in the awesome world of UI, this course is well worth your time.",coursereport

I never felt realised with this job, though, on the contrary I was feeling stuck in a dead-end.I thought I had to become more technical and I always felt an affinity to web technologies, although I only knew HTML and CSS so far. I got in touch with CareerFoundry almost by chance, I started getting info and reviews about this online school and I found them all positive. Besides, the course fee was still reasonable for my pockets and being an online course, it was ideal for me as a working student. The assistance of my mentor had always been punctual, friendly and motivating. It was not easy at CareerFoundry, especially for someone who, like me, had 0 coding experience. I was not certainly afraid of learning Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Angular, but I found a great support in their international student community. That is awesome, the way CareerFoundry with a simple slack team created a friendly network of aspiring webdevelopers all over the world. With some of them I remained in touch and even developed some projects together. Learning a new profession from scratch when you are already working is not simple, it is hard, it is effort and self-esteem consuming as well, particularly if you're over 40 years old, like I was and am. Finally I had a new professional perspective, and I really need to thank CareerFoundry , if I was able to leave my old job and land my first job as Junior Web Developer with Rails. I have to thank them for their courses, obviously, but also for the motivation network, if I can say so, that they were able to build up through their international students and mentors community.",coursereport

It was by far the best decision I ever made! I have learned more than I could have ever imagined in the past 3 1/2 months. The great thing about CF is that you learn by doing. The lessons are brief and then you jump in and do a project. 66 to be exact. Is hard work? Yes. But do I feel prepared? Absolutely!

1839,Careerfoundry,2016-10-31,"Today I'm quitting Career Foundry and these are my reasons. 1) I signed up thinking I could do the course at my own pace. CF shouldn't advertise their courses saying ""study online at your own pace"", it is a misleading statement. 2) When my laptop crashed and I had no computer for 2 weeks, I asked for an extension and was declined on the basis that I wasn't keeping track. If felt like they were saying to me ""you're a bad student, and bad students get punished"", and this left me stressed. 3) Once I became aware of the time limit, I started rushing my assignments, the quality of my work suffered, and I stopped enjoying it. I was doing the course based on my own app idea, so it was really important that I did it properly and took my time. 4) A lot of people on Course Report have been saying that the course takes 2-3 times longer than the stated 15 hours per week. I don't have a spare 15-30 hours more each week, and I am not willing to pay 2-3 times the amount of money to finish it. In summary, my experience of CF is that you use misleading advertising jargon, don't put your students learning needs at the core of your value proposition, have poor customer service, and care more about money than a good student experience. I think your company culture comes across as defensive. The only thing that gives your company a heart is your course tutors, they bring life to the subject, where your content is lacking in depth.",coursereport
1840,Careerfoundry,2016-10-23,"I highly recommend Career Foundry's Web development course. I had some background in coding, mostly by learning through Codacademy. However, I was looking for something a bit more substantial. This course is intense, but in the good way. The exercises, topics and skills covered give you a good basic understanding of the webdevelopment spectrum, and leave room for more exploration if you want to dive deeper. Every expersice includes theory, and hands on coding. The results are submitted to your mentor. If something is not working, you will have to fix it. This urges you to learn and think as a coder, where can the bug be?! Sometimes it's frustrating and time consuming, but the eureka (!) moment you 'get it' is very gratifying. By urging you to get it right, Career Foundry also maintains the quality of the curriculum. My mentor was very helpful. He wrote me long emails explaining where I could improve. Or we used video chat over slack when I got really stuck. He always helped me progress and was very encouraging. I'm a college graduate, I'm used to communicating in English and I'm used to study by my self. I took the 'part-time' course. I have a full time job (40+) hours a week. Be prepared to spend two night and a weekend-day, or your whole weekend on coursework. I finished within 6 months, it's doable but you have to commit serious time and effort.

They addressed all of my questions and concerns quickly and to my satisfaction. This included changing mentors after my first one was non-responsive, and ongoing job support even after I graduated. After finishing this course I had one end-to-end project piece for my portfolio and a fairly good understanding of the UX design process, but you'll need more than that to get hired as a UX designer, especially if you're coming from an unrelated field. Companies want to see client work samples, not just student projects. Cold applying to jobs doesn't get you very far - you'll need connections within the design industry to get much needed personal referrals. Unless you're already in a similar role (graphic design, visual design, product management, front-end development, etc.) plan to go to a lot of meetups, workshops, conferences and/or hackathons to build your network.",coursereport

CareerFoundry's web development curriculum is great, it guides you just enough and it pushes you to explore interesting concepts on your own. My mentor was very nice and available relatively quickly to answer my questions. They would always be able to get me out of a jam. I was enrolled in the program before the tutor/mentor change was made, and I think that having someone to help you prepare for jobs is very important. What I found to be the best part of the bootcamp is the community of students and staff. Students are encouraged to work together, help each other with issues.

He normaly replies faster than 24h after I asked him something, which is really cool. The feedback I' getting from him is also very helpful and you can learn so much from it! I can't recommend the mentor based approach enough. It's just amazing! All in all I'm so happy that I took this class, because I already learned so much new and interesting stuff.

The price was right not too expensive plus I could make payments if I wanted to (paid in full). So I broke down and did the UX course. The UX course was a lot fun and yes some of was dry, not going to lie, but it was something that you had to do and understand what you are learning. They go over surveys, personas, wireframes, design, your resume to your portfolio. The best thing that Careerfoundry has going is the class comes with the mentor. I have to honestly say it is the mentor and the slack community makes a huge differences. The mentor is the key... gonna be honest not all mentors are the same but in my book if you don't gel with your mentor you can get another one. You just have to be proactive about it and let Careerfoundry know or even better tell your mentor what your want and what your needs are. They are there to help you. If you don't say anything nothing will happen they can not read your mind. I realize most students want out of their crappy jobs... trust me been there. There is a process you have to go through.. I know this part sucks you want to take the class and get out of your crappy job. Take your time with the class and learn.. if you can push it then you can... I would recommend Careerfoundry... actually I finish the UX course and yes worked off my tail. I was able to get a UI/UX visual designer job. I almost double my salary, but along the way I had tons of phone interviews some I bomb and some I did good. I had face to face yes some bomb and some was good and the more you have. The more you will be able to hone in your style of interviewing. So don't give up and keep moving forward. I love the UX class so much that I am taking the UI course now with my new gig. So if I can do it then you can do it as well. Don't waste months thinking about it like it... Dive in and click that button. I am glad I did.",coursereport
1846,Careerfoundry,2016-10-11,"I started the CareerFoundry course after already doing a UX design week-long short course with another company. It had been really hard to grasp the basics of UX in a week and althiugh I'd been working as a UX designer for about four months previously, I really needed a confidence boost. Studying the CareerFoundry course was the making of me. It is coursework-based and pupils are allowed to work on the UX project of their choice. I chose to redesign my company’s help and support offering which meant I got to learn and also positively impact the company too. The main benefits for me were: the bite-sized lesson plans (I tried to do three each week after work) the bi-weekly Skype sessions with a mentor the after-care following the course. I’m still in contact with my mentor Sophie Lepinoy who has been a real inspiration to me. I also love the Slack channel as it is a great way of keeping in contact with other graduates and learning about the latest UX developments. Studying UX with CareerFoundry has given me the confidence that I actually have a useful skill, an identity and a career path. It has also opened doors for me. I got the travel bug in December 2015 and moved from the UK to Christchurch, New Zealand to work as a UX Designer for digital agency, NV Interactive. I then moved to Auckland to work as a UX Analyst for Datacom who are New Zealand’s largest IT company. I genuinely don’t think I would have had the confidence to apply for these roles overseas without my CareerFoundry training.",coursereport
1847,Careerfoundry,2016-09-16,"I wandered alot on the internet before someone recommended CF for me! I have been always interested in the UX field and wanted to become an expert in it, unfortunately the more I ""googled"" it the more it became complex and harder to learn! CareerFoundry UX course developed a study area, where the material is well organized, resources are available, experts are on-call, 1 on 1 communication channels, and the best of all; the established a community for the students to connect through! Where we can share thoughts, experiences and fun. I am so confident about my skills, I am starting to lecture my colleagues about UX.",coursereport
1848,Careerfoundry,2016-09-15,"I started the web development course in the beginning of April and finished it by the second half of September. I thought I could finish the course in less time. But for someone with no previous experience in coding, I felt that I needed all that time to assimilate and practice all the concepts and the information contained in the course, which is a lot in a very short period of time. To someone starting a course online like this, I would recommend self-discipline and consistency. It is really easy to get detracted and you do need to spend time on it everyday. Getting all available support was really important and necessary for me. In this sense, mentoring and tutoring were an underpinning aspect of my experience. As clear and concise as the materials are, I don’t think I would have succeeded without the constant support and feedback from both tutor and mentor. Your tutor is available for you on slack a set of hours every day and I cannot highlight enough how important this is. My mentor was key in my learning process and he also gave the support I needed when I thought that the course wasn’t working for me. I got very detailed and professional video feedback from my mentor as well, and the mentor calls really helped me keep track and stick to my goals throughout the process. Course materials and learning resources are comprehensive and constantly updated. The course is structured in such a way that you acquire the core skills that are needed to become a web developer. When I mention skills, I don’t mean the coding languages you learn (you’re trained both in frontend and backend) but a certain attitude and predisposition that all web developers need to have to be successful: being resourceful, resilient, analytic, cooperate with others whilst still being independent enough to find solutions to problems. They train you on how to develop the ability to grasp how code works in general so that every time you learn a new language it’s just easier because you can relate to the languages you already know and establish parallelisms. After all, code is code and all languages follow a certain pattern of syntax with many common aspects. Concerning the languages they teach, I did find necessary to have a few lessons on PHP. Although it’s not the best of backend languages, it’s still broadly demanded by employers and the course doesn’t cover it. Once you enrol in your course and after your finish your course, you have full access to all those resources online and the great thing about this is that you can still keep learning and studying the updated course materials. This makes easy for you to be always ahead and up to date with changes in web development. The career advisor team accompanied me all the way through my job searching process even before I had completed the course. They gave me all professional support I needed to have a new CV as a web developer and update my linkedin profile accordingly to fit into the industry standards. And they helped me to find a paid internship as a frontend developer when I finished the course. In all, as someone without any previous knowledge in coding, I feel the Career Foundry Web development course prepared me to become a junior web developer in every single aspect and they provided me with the skills to take my knowledge further once I finished the course. However, I don’t want to give a misleading message. No one learns coding in 6 months, and this is not what they promise –in case there’s any confusion. You need to be mentally ready and willing to dot whatever it takes for this to work for you. The course is highly demanding in terms of time and energy and you are expected to be really focused, positive, motivated and driven by the desire of experimenting a real career change. And by the way, they don’t hide this, as they make this very clear before you enrol so that you’re not led to confusion on what the course requires from you.",coursereport
1849,Careerfoundry,2016-09-13,"I did some research before choosing Careerfoundry, and i liked how they were very helpfull, telling me about the course and how it worked. I then decided to start the web developer course, i had some experience from before so the front end went really fast. The ruby on rails part there was some ups and down, i wasnt so lucky to get a good mentor, was almost never online and i had to rely on myself to find all the answers. I managed to finish this course in 3 months even though choosing the 6 month, never giving up is the answer and as a web developer you need to be independent alot, which i learned. Once though when i got replies it was very vague and didnt really show me where to go. If i would improve something is having the mentors more active and talking with you.",coursereport
1850,Careerfoundry,2016-08-23,"After much research, I decided the length of the course and the affordability of the CareerFoundry Web Developer course fit well for me. The course is a great guided framework of the tools, language and methodology of the development world. If you're looking for a fully-guided fully immersed course, this is not the one for you. I found that it required quite a bit of outisde learning with all the other great web developmer courses suchs Ruby the Hard Way, Ruby Koans, etc. to supplement this course. Much work and effort will need to be put in on your end, but that's ok!, you're learning a new skill. You should allow sufficient time for your tutors and mentors to get back to you, but they are a huge resource to get you set in the right direction. Having both a tutor for the technical help and the mentor for job assistance was really great! Thanks CareerFoundry for helping me to make the jump to a new job!",coursereport
1851,Careerfoundry,2016-08-11,"I didn't have a good opinion of CareerFoundry at first (my mentor in the course went AWOL for weeks) and things had been going well until then. The site is very easy to use, the way it's set up motivates you to get work done. So when the mentor issue came up (I think he had some major life event) I was actually really upset, because I was enjoying the course! I brought it to CF and they took a few days and very sincerely apologized and returned my tuition. I'm planning on retaking the course in the near future-- the mentor thing seemed to be a fluke, and it's actually a great course. And, after my interactions with CF, I get the feeling that they really take an interest in their students, and making sure they get what they need.",coursereport
1852,Careerfoundry,2016-08-10,"I found Careerfoundry while searching for online programming related courses and decided to apply for the Web Development course and give it a try. It was one of the cheapest and most interesting courses I found online and besides that I would be able to work with a tutor and a mentor. It was the best decision I could have ever made. I started with little knowledge of programming but after 6 months of the course I am now able to do anything from static websites to consumer web apps. It also helped me to think further and learn more and more everyday. Everyone is really nice and helpful and the mentor skype calls are a must. My mentor Andre was motivating me a lot by sharing his experience in the industry and telling me how I should do everything during and after the course. He was also always very interested in my projects and helped me achieve what I wanted. Korina, the student advisor, is the most sympathetic person ever, she is always there to help you with course related questions. Careerfoundry is really all about their students happiness and success and it's very refreshing to see and experience companies that still do that. I am very happy with the course and very motivated to find my first job!",coursereport
1853,Careerfoundry,2016-08-04,"I find Careerfoundry a great place to start if you want to change your career. They introduse you to everything you need to know in one place, so you don't have to jump from one website to another. It guides you through and introduces to numerous great tools that make your life as a designer easier. I have a design background but I still took the UI course to systematize the knowledge necessary to work in Tech Industry where I want to be now (I was in Advertising before). It did the job. And the fact that you have a mentor and a student advisor is almost a guarantee that you will finish it. Unless in many other online courses that just provide the materials and where nobody helps you to go through them. I recommend! :)",coursereport
1854,Careerfoundry,2016-08-03,"The course is good, you learn the stuff you need to know and the best thing is that you end up with something to show in your portfolio.

They ensure continuity and quality along your journey—it's a distant learning experience that feels very personal and thorough.",coursereport
1856,Careerfoundry,2016-06-28,"I love this course so much and have convinced 3 other people to take it. It is one of the lowest prices out there for one, and you still get an amazing course. The lessons teach you so much and personally my mentor I think is the best one out there. She was always pushing me (which aside from offering up more information then what was even in the course through books or confernece suggestions, she also had me fix almost every homework assignment). I do think your mentor makes the course. I also have a full time job that is usally pretty easy and I still found even doing the 6 month course I was behind 6 weeks. That said I did change my project 3 weeks in from the one CF has you do which is currently a Project Managment app to a charity site I was already working on and had to go back and redo a bunch of projects which tooke me about a week and a half. It made the site so much stronger and I am so proud of how far it has come because of this course. They even have a job offer guarentee now and really do focus at the end in making sure you have a portfolio to find that new job opportunity. Cannot wait to finish and see what happens next.",coursereport
1857,Careerfoundry,2016-05-15,"CareerFoundry is exactly the type of online coding school I was looking for to learn Web development. Firstly, the total cost of the course and the flexible payment option were a plus and suited my financial situation. Secondly, the way the course is written and broken down into a front-end course and back-end course enhanced my ability to learn the material in a thorough and timely manner. The course really focuses on self-learning, but you are never alone. As a CF student you have a dedicated mentor and a slack community to turn to for those times that are a little more difficult. Overall the CF Web Development course is a great course that has enabled me to create a second career for myself doing something that I really enjoy.",coursereport
1858,Careerfoundry,2016-05-08,"When I first signed up for CareerFoundry Full Stack Web Developer Course, I was expecting the course to be like other online courses I had taken before. I will watch a lot of videos which will be follow by small exercises that help me learn the concepts in the videos. What I didn't expect from taking this course, was exercises that actually teach you and give you a hands-on approach to learning web development. Not only do you get a wonderful mentor that can help you when you get stuck on an exercise, but you also get a student advisor for help during the course and a career success manager for when you finish the course who will make sure your career is successful. What I really liked about CareerFoundry is right at the beginning you have to build your own web portfolio which is basically your ""web resume"" that you show to potential employers. The other thing I liked was the projects we had to make, full projects where I can actually show to employers. My Mentor Ryan, was a great mentor. When I had a bug in my code, he will spent his time endlessly looking for a solution. No matter how dumb my question was, Ryan will happily answer them. Korina, my student advisor, was extremely helpful when I was taking the course. Anais, my career success manager, is currently assisting me in finding a job and jump starting my career. Overall, if you are looking for a way to start learning web development, I recommend CareerFoundry, you will get a great mentor who can help you solve your coding problems, a student advisor who will answer all your questions during the course so you won't get lost and a career success manager to assist you in your job search. Of course, the curriculum is top-notch too.",coursereport
1859,Careerfoundry,2016-04-15,"I took the web developer course with CF. Well written material overall, and it directs you to start building a profile page a small portfolio that you can leverage when you're finished the course. I finished the course material in 3 months, and spent the next 2 and half months rebuilding my own project. Course material is good and understandable. The mentorship piece is where everything falls apart. Obviously your mentor's will not know everything and part of code is learning how to Google many of your problems -but the mentors seemed disengaged, often just told me to Google my problem (like I hadn't been doing that for 2-3 days already) and many times are not easy to get a hold of even during their scheduled hours to help. I signed up with CF for the mentorship and cost, and I can't say I regret using their program, but just be cautious if you are looking at the mentorship piece as a key deciding factor on using CF.",coursereport
1860,Careerfoundry,2016-04-12,"I enrolled in CF for two reasons: it was cheap, and it allowed me to still work. I was assigned to a mentor, who was alright, to be fair. The lessons felt like they were made by a good front-end developer who worked as (or maybe related to a teacher) a teaching assistant, and a back-end developer who really sucked at teaching. The Web Development course is designed that you make an app but the overall impression I had was that it is not something you showcase in a portfolio--- it lacks the wow factor to get you hired that you might have better chances if you say you have not built anything but you are very trainable. I learned things--- but boy, it was not worth the money. I get the frustration when your program fails to work, but the reason it fails is that it you were not taught properly how to do it right in the first place.",coursereport
1861,Careerfoundry,2016-04-11,"This course presents a highly-detailed, well-structured and comprehensive introduction to web development. I've completed a range of free web development tutorials online in the past, but always felt that there was a lack of structure in what I was learning, and I never felt like I was truly understanding the mechanics of what I was doing as a I followed along those other tutorials. By contrast, the CareerFoundry materials are exceptionally well written and organised. The course provides great breadth in covering all the core components of front-end and back-end web development, and the mentorship element of the program added depth to that learning through clear responses to any questions I had. I started to really understand concepts that I'd seen previously but only ever grasped on a superficial level. I highly recommend this course.",coursereport
1862,Careerfoundry,2016-03-28,"I've been using Online learning platforms for many years, and can honestly say it is my main source of continued education. I'm a Lynda.com subscriber and I myself am a course developer and author for Video2brain in Spanish. For many years I struggled to learn coding from the said resources, mainly because they lacked the needed structure that ""makes you"" finish assignments on a timely basis. But I think that the worse part of typical online learning is that when you get stuck, there's no one that comes to your help and pushes you forward. Well, this is where CF really shines. I was assigned a mentor who had my back 100% of the way. He checked on me weekly and made sure that no questions went unanswered. He also gave me ""real world"" advise on the job market and where to take my skills. It's my believe that this is the key to succeeding with Online learning. I must also say that the curriculum is top notch. The pace is fast, but not so fast as to make your head spin. The resources provided in the course alone are worth the price of admission. So, if you're looking for a course that will set you moving in the right direction, and you're willling to put in the time and effort, I think this is the one for you.",coursereport
1863,Careerfoundry,2016-03-21,"Career Foundry has been the perfect fit for me. I wanted to learn web development, but I have a full-time day job and need the flexibility that online education provides. Prior to enrolling in Career Foundry, I tried to learn web development on my own with online resources such as Codecademy. Unfortunately, without someone to bounce questions or guidance off of, I found myself hitting the wall too many times. Career Foundry was the answer as I have as my mentor who has been a excellent resource for questions and for reviewing my work to be sure I'm grasping the concepts and coding correctly. Career Foundry is 100% on your own schedule. When I researched other programs, many of the other online programs had set dates/times when they expected students to be online for lectures of demos. The convienence of being able to study and practice coding whenever I want has allowed me to maintain a balance with all areas of my busy life. Lastly, the cost cannot be beat!!! Most of the other programs I researched charged $5000-$15000 and did not offer any more instruction. Career Foundry fits my schedule, budget, and lifestyle. I recommend it to anyone looking to learn web development on their own schedule without breaking the My only critique is that Career Foundry does not offer job placement. I'm currently finishing up the program and am hopeful I'll get an entry-level web developer job upon graduation with a job search, but wish Career Foundry could help place me into a good first developer job.",coursereport

1865,Careerfoundry,2016-03-10,"After trying several free and paid courses on HTML and CSS I stumbled upon CareerFoundry's course offer. The curriculum and the fact that you get your own mentor to guide you throughout the entire course got me to give it a go. I didn't regret it for a second. I was happy to have done some HTML and CSS before twhich helped me a lot to get through those tasks. When I started with Ruby things got more tricky for mr initially. Luckily I had a great and very responsive mentor who helped me to reach my goals step by step. Additionally you'll get referred to plenty of additional material to go deeper into the different topics. Overall I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to start their web development career as it's fun, challenging and teaching you plenty of useful skills to get your feet off the ground.",coursereport

It has been single handedly the best thing I have ever payed for. The curriculum is on point and and broken down very well. My Instructor (Ryan Smith) has been excellent and very helpful, with fast responses and very productive crticism and help. At no point during this course did I feel alone or unable to complete it with very little to limited knowledge of anything computer related coming into this. 5/5 would reccomend",coursereport
1867,Careerfoundry,2016-02-29,"I am finishing up the UX course now and overall I think it was a decent experience. I am the type of person who can easily commit to self-learning, but I like the structure of a lesson plan, so CareerFoundry was perfect for me. You do a series of lessons online over the course of 3-6 months that eventually compile into a portfolio. A portfolio is key to landing a UX job, so I thought CF would be a good fit for my goals. The curriculum was generally good but not without its flaws. I am transitioning into UX from a related role, and I think certain parts of the course would have been a huge struggle without my previous experience to fall back on. Some lessons were pretty hit or miss at times or seemed vague in their instruction or strangely ordered. For those reasons, I would probably recommend this class to someone either with at least some previous tech experience or a little self study under their belt. I think someone completely new to tech might struggle a little bit. That being said, CF does seem to do a good job of giving you an overview of the various responsibilities a UX designer may have, which allows you to get your feet wet and figure out what type of role you want out of your next job. My mentor was very nice and was somewhat available. I can't speak for all the CF mentors, but I know my mentor was very new to the UX field (less than 6 months). If you're expecting to have direct access to a senior UXer as your mentor, you might be pretty disappointed. I haven't checked back on this, but I could have sworn that CF promised their mentors had at least 2-3 years of field experience, which is clearly false. However, it is a self-learning class, so as long as your mentor is knowledgable enough to help you where you need it and you don't have tons of deep industry questions, the mentorship should be sufficient. CF doesn't offer any job placement, which you might not really expect for the price anyway. It is much much more affordable than something like General Assembly, which at press time is charging $11.5k for their UX class. Even with all the flaws of CF, I can't imagine General Assembly being over 6x better. For what its worth, I know many people who have gone through the GA courses only to seriously struggle to find work... CF certainly won't make you immune to those obstacles, what with so many industry newbies flooding the market with only bootcamp experience, but if you are resolved to take this route, you might be pretty happy to have that extra $10k in your pocket while you look for work... Overall if you're looking for a way into UX, CareerFoundry is a decent option that doesn't require you to quit your job or take out a second mortgage against your house. Obviously or not so obviously to some people, tech bootcamps are not some magic way into a perfect, high salaried tech job, but CF is a less risky option due to its pricing and flexibility. I would say its a good investment for the money and would be especially useful for current tech workers looking to expand their skillset or transition their career if UX is a lateral move.",coursereport
1868,Careerfoundry,2016-02-13,"The title speaks for itself. I researched many diffrent schools and bootcamps, but having a wife and a baby on the way, I needed somthing I could do from the comfort of my own home. I also wanted someone to keep me accountable, and then I found Career Foundry. With their online course and mentorship program (and don't forget the awesome price!) I decided that it was the program for me. I started my journey into Web Development in July 2015 and completing the course within 6 months, I applied to a company and after 45 mintues of sending out my resume, I got a call to come in for an interview and was hired on the spot! I now work for an amazing company, building fully responsive websites and enjoying every moment of it. I definitely would recommend Career Foundry.",coursereport
1869,Careerfoundry,2016-02-02,"I chose the Web Development track for CareerFoundry on the reccomendation of my friend, who took the UX design course (and got an internship, and then 70k a year job shortly after). It's a 6 month track and it took me just over 4 months to do it, even with a full time job. I had been wanting to switch into the Web Dev field for a while and primarily chose CareerFoundry because of its affordability and the fact that I could do it on my time. There aren't a lot of comparable options. Overall, I was satisfied by my experience. I learned a LOT- CareerFoundry gives you all the foundations you need to build a static website and Ruby on Rails application, which in turn gives you the foundation for other frameworks. My mentor was available from 7pm-11pm every day, and was incredibly helpful. He gave me a lot of help on his own, sometimes stayed a little later than his shift to help me, and he taught me a lot. However, he also taught me the importance of being resourceful and looking stuff up on my own. I'm not sure that ""just taking the course"" will get you a job- but nonetheless, neither will ""going to college."" However, without the structure of the course to help me, I don't think I would have been as sucessful with my learning. You essentially build two websites for the course, both of which can be used as ""portfolio projects"" to apply for a job. The course doesn't focus on javascript and algorithms and things like that as much as it could have, so that's really what my next step has to be. Another important aspect to CareerFoundry is the Slack community and the networking opportunity it presents. And when your mentor isn't available and StackOverflow doesn't seem to be able to answer your question, you can likely get an answer on there. Their customer service and staff are incredibly friendly and helpful and genuinely want you to succeed. While they don't seem to have the resources to be able to do direct job placement, they do provide other advice to students. Personally, I feel like I could maybe apply for jobs now and be successful, but want to learn a bit more. If I didn't take this course and just tried to learn unguided and compiling other resources together, I'm not sure I would have been as motivated in successful in my endeavors. While I have yet to land a job, I believe that this was a great investment of $1,500 and the boost I need- I couldn't quit my job and go do a $15,000 bootcamp. This is affordable, you learn a lot and I would reccomend it to anyone. Suggestions: They have a few ""optional projects"" like a calculator in JavaScript that you can make or a rails ""to-do"" app and give you suggesions on how to make them. In my opinion, they could add a few more of these, as it wouldn't require much staffing on their part but really help their students.",coursereport
1870,Careerfoundry,2016-02-02,"I'm taking the developer course and I've just about finished the exercises and achievements. Pros: The curriculum is setup well and it's easy to track your progress and see where you are going. Having a mentor is a great resource and the Slack community is pretty knowledgeable and accessable. Compared to other bootcamps the price is reasonable too. Cons: This is still self-based learning and if you get stuck on a problem you are encouraged to try and figure out the issue yourself by looking online. Yes, you can ask the community or your mentor, but you will not always get quick responses. Part of being a developer is learning how to google your issues and how to fix things on your own so in a way this is a good thing. I don't believe there is much in the way of job assistance, but if you ask your mentor or the community you can be pointed in the right direction. Overall, I liked my experience and feel I learned a lot about web development, but I've only scratched the tip of the iceberg. There is so much more to learn and this course is just the beginning. I think it is possible to get a job after this course, but you must be disciplined and continue building and learning on your own.",coursereport
1871,Careerfoundry,2016-01-27,"The content was decent, although there were plenty of errors in the lessons, some that would completely throw off your learning until you inquired to your mentor or the community only to find out it's an error in the lesson. I'm not clear on why these things weren't corrected immediately, even after they'd been brought to the attention of CF multiple times. My mentor was very little help. This is the worst part since it was the EXACT reason I signed up...for mentor access. He was often not available when he said he would be and often took a week or more to respond to questions or lessons. Also, we are promised 12 skype sessions, I got exactly 0 (it appears they no longer provide that, lol). My guess is this is more mentor specific, as many other students have raved about how responsive and helpful their mentors were. So, you'll want to make sure you get a good mentor and if you don't, ask for a new one. Also, there isn't any job assistance whatsoever. The ""student success manager"" never checked in, although I received a few automated broadcast emails with general advice. I was surprised that after six months, there wasn't one personal check in. Because of these issues, I can hardly recommend the course, not for $1900! Maybe $300. I have used Treehouse for more than a year and the content and overall quality is outstanding (unfortunately, there just aren't any mentors...for now).",coursereport
1872,Careerfoundry,2016-01-26,"I started the Web Developer course as a complete newbie and in the beginning felt the learning was well supported. As time went on, my mentor was little help, the course materials were lacking in places and my experience hasn't been enough to get an internship, let alone an actual job. When I got stuck in places, it was up to Google and Stack Overflow to save me. The feedback I received was minimal and if not for the online community, I never would have finished. I do think they provide a lot of great resources and teach you the basics. It just isn't enough to get a job as advertised.",coursereport
1873,Careerfoundry,2016-01-20,I loved my time with CareerFoundry. I found my mentor to be extremely knowledgeable and encouraging. The mentor was probably my favorite part of the course. I also liked the format of the course material. The assignments were clear and easy to understand. They don't unlock the next section until you finished the previous one. This made it easier for me to stay focused and on track. My experience was a very positive one. I will be continuing my education with them later this month by taking the Web Developer Course.,coursereport

I also had a great mentor, the questions I had got answered very quick from the careerfoundry team. Overall a very good experience!",coursereport
1879,Careerfoundry,2015-12-06,"I signed up for CareerFoundry's ""Web Development"" course with the belief that at the end of the course, I would be ready to apply for junior-level jobs in my area, as per their online promise. I was suckered in by their cutesy-poo story of some developer who was unemployed and after three months was working as a freelance developer. That may be well and dandy, but it would be nice to see a roadmap as to how to go down that path. But this is my review of CareerFoundry. PROS CareerFoundry is affordable. It is cheaper than other bootcamps where you pay 10% of your mortgage, but you pay for what you get. My mentor was nice and knowledgable, but per CF you are only entitled to one Skype call per week. So Google and StackOverflow become your friends. The community on Slack is (somewhat) engaging. There's a lot of ""Hi, I'm from [insert country here]"" where you can meet other people. CONS CF is more geared toward UX/UI development and freelance web development. So if you're looking for support in web development for a company, you won't find it here. There are NO CAREER RESOURCES. No help for technical interviews, job preparation (they don't do placement), resume writing, nothing. Sidenote: how do you call yourself CAREERFoundry and provide no career support? They claim to have an ""extensive job network"", but that's for European jobs in UX/UI. The majority of their lessons leave a lot to be desired. They say that no programming experience is required, but if you've never even looked at HTML before, you'll be blown away by the early assignments. Good luck asking for help on the forums. I've come across problems with assignments and tried to post questions and received no help. Your portfolio consists of ""two"" projects: the personal website and a Ruby on Rails app. Nothing to really impress a potential employer. If you're a PC user, you will struggle with the RoR portion and they provide no support. Bottom line is, you can go through Treehouse and get the same skills at a fraction of what you pay for CF. I cannot recommend this program to anyone.",coursereport
1880,Careerfoundry,2015-11-27,"I've finished course ""Full-stack web developer"" recently. I was great experience for me and I got a lot of information. The course is well-design and you develop real project. As a result you can see your work in real life. Nevertheless, this course assumes that you should learn detailed information by yourself. I mean, that the course gives you only base knowledge and you should be prepared work alone in some cases. My mentor was qualified and helped me a lot.",coursereport
1881,Careerfoundry,2015-11-27,"If you are beginner in the field please avoid this UX designer course or you are in for a bad time. No previous experience necessary? That's not true at all! The first section asks you to write a proposal to a company including an analysis, timeframe and pricing. Sounds great? Well, don't expect to get any help or material relating to how to write a real project proposal. In fact, the majority of the material was completely irrelevant to the task and the little help you get are some outdated links to web applications and blog posts. The submitted answers by fellow colleagues are clearly made by professionals with previous experience in the field. Finally, the platform is buggy. My mentor didn't receive some messages or the submit button wouldn't work. I have also noted some sudden changes in how you are supposed to submit a project without prior notice. For instance, all of a sudden i'm supposed to use Adobe's Behance to submit my paper without explanations on what it is or why. My colleagues, however, were able to send their papers as PDF files not long ago. I tried to like this course and i believe that I gave my very best. But I seem to get more from a good book at a tiny fraction of the cost. The mentor is nice but Skype calls only once a week are not enough since the course material itself just leaves you hanging. Overall, I regret my decision to pay such a large sum of money and i cannot recommend this Careerfoundry course to anyone.",coursereport
1882,Careerfoundry,2015-11-05,"I am finishing up the course and wanted to share my experience with the program. I initially decided to go with CareerFoundry because of the cost - for the money, there isn't a comparable online bootcamp that offers one on one mentorship and teaches full stack web development. I also didn't know if I wanted to (or even had the ability to) code and potentially pursue a career in it, so this was a perfect entry point. In the beginning, I didn't know anything about writing code or anything about programming languages. The course is well-designed for people starting from zero experience - the lessons are structured into manageable tasks that explain terminology, the how/why of things, and detailed instructions in actually writing the code. By the end of the course, I went from not knowing anything about coding to being able to make my own personal website and also how to make an e-commerce (fancy way of saying a website that sells something) site with Ruby on Rails - one of the more popular programming options right now. My mentor reviewed my work on every exercise and let me know if I could improve anything and what to focus on. If I had questions, he responded within a day or two. There's also a forum/group that every student is signed into and I've seen that the people on there are pretty responsive and try to help each other. I can't comment on job assistance as I haven't talked to my mentor yet, but this course gave me a good idea of what I can do next. I think that's the important takeaway - ultimately, I got out of the experience what I put into it. The program's a lot of time and effort, so it isn't a walk in the park, ""barely scratching the surface"" course, but if you use all the resources that you're given, it's definitely a good starting point in learning how to code.",coursereport
1883,Careerfoundry,2015-10-21,"CareerFoundry's UX program is challenging and really pushes students to learn the ins and outs of UX while creating great work. Each lesson has vital and helpful information, but my favorite part of the program is being paired with a mentor. Unlike other online programs I've gone through, the mentor/mentee aspect of this one really helps to make sure you understand the concept/fundamentals before moving onto the next section. If you're looking to break into the field of UX, I would highly recommend this program!",coursereport
1884,Careerfoundry,2015-10-19,"This course is a lot of work! Be prepared for 6 months of doing nothing but going to work FT and working on this class in every other spare moment. This course takes you through every step of what it is like to be a freelance UX designer - your mentor acts like your client for some assigments. Most of the reading assigments were helpful, some of the links/processes need to be updated. On average you are supposed to spend 10-15 hours per week on 5 assigments (or one module). Most of the time I spent 2-3x that amount. There is a lot of homework! Most of the time the assignments were very vague and I had to ask my mentor what I was supposed to do. In the beginning my mentor was helpful in keeping me motivated when I really just wanted to give up. In the end when I was scrampbing to finish up assignments, I wouldn't hear from my mentor for days. So if I had a question, I would be loosing precoius time waiting for a response (it didn't help that for whatever reason CF gave me a mentor that lived in a time zone 9 hours ahead of me). Overall, it is a good course and I learned a lot! Just be prepared to spend ALOT of time on the assigments. I'm not sure how you would come away with a feel-good project at the end by only spending 2 hours on each assigment as CF outlines in the course overview.",coursereport

1886,Careerfoundry,2015-10-09,"I found UX through my current career as a full time composer in Los Angeles. There aren't many people bridging the two worlds so I began meeting with a UX designer locally and got really inspired by my meetings with him. I also attended UX boot camps and began reading books. After spending a month searching for an online UX design course, I finally found an article written by CF's founder on a UX blog which totally blew me away. The way he decoded and demystified the process of applying UX seemed to be within reach for someone with very little experience. At that point, I was preparing to pay a lot of money for an immersive UX course but ended up going with CF and saved a lot of money in the process AND ended up meeting my incredible mentor. I can't say enough how pleased I've been with my class and especially my mentor - she's been fantastic! However CF found her, and I got paired with her is a miracle or luck or both. But one thing for certain, I have a new approach to using UX in all of daily tasks. Not to mention, I will hopefully nail down a job soon as a UX designer to gain more experience in this fascinating field. There were a few moments I questioned the curriculum and specifically some of the organization of the curriculum. I have no doubts the CF team is staying on top of the latest trends, and updating the course as needed. I am so thankful that CF exists and is literally going to change people's lives. I hope one day, I can meet the CF team in Berlin :)",coursereport
1887,Careerfoundry,2015-10-05,"There are three ways how to learn a new tool / skill - dig and learn it by yourself, study at a school / university, find an intense course that focuses on explaining one theme that interests you the most. A year ago I realised that I am a great graphic designer and media artist but to make good money with it I need to jump to a next level. Taking into account my skills in design, digital media, research and writing I decided to learn UX Design. I did a lot of research online and found CareerFoundry. First, I went to UX meet-up in Berlin and saw how professional CareerFoundry team is. After that I applied for UX Design course and since then almost every day within next 7 months was filled with new and useful information about how to develop digital projects. I learned how to form and develop my own business idea, about user-centred thinking, information architecture, interaction design, wireframing, prototyping, user testing and more. I had to put a lot of effort in it and in the end I felt self-confident. I went to a first job interview after the course and got that job. The only thing I can say from my experience - it works!

1889,Careerfoundry,2015-09-09,"When I decided to become a Web Developer I tried many online tutorials and books without success. The problem was that I was jumping from one tutorial to another without following a path or a defined objective. Not only CareerFoundry gave me a defined path that starts from the basics up to advanced programming, but I was also assisted by a mentor which is the CareerFoundry most precious feature. The mentor was always present to explain complicated concepts and helped me every time I got stuck at some point. Having a mentor was also a big motivation for not being lazy because every week I had to report my progress to someone and have precious feedbacks about it. Now I feel confident enough to keep improving my skills and looking for my first employment as Web Developer, I strongly recommend CareerFoundry to anyone who wants to learn web development but doesn't know where to start or how to do that.",coursereport

1891,Careerfoundry,2015-08-16,"I started Career Foundry having done some free online tutorials in HTML, CSS & Ruby and having struggled though the Michael Hartl Ruby on Rails Tutorial not really understanding how things were put together. The structure of Career Foundry really motivated me to get through the course because after each lesson you have something to show for your work. The tutorials are clear, structured and as you progress through the course it prepares you for life after the tutorials. In addition you have a great knowledge of so many elements of web development by the end you really understand how everything is put together. I finished having built a personal portfolio site, e-commerce site that integrates with Stripe to process payments, learning about the bootstrap framework, github, triggering e-mails, creating a review system, form validations, user login, automated tests, the list goes on! and the most exciting part is that the foundation gives you the confidence to then go out and find a solution to a problem youself/for a new feature, so that if you've never done it before you know you'll be able to find a way. The mentoring part was a key element to speeding up learning and motivation. Without a mentor you might get stuck for hours looking on Stack Overflow for an answer, but your mentor can help breakdown a problem you face so that you fully understand how to overcome it much faster so that you can move on. I work as a Product Manager and Career Foundry has given me a great understanding of the day-to-day work of our Development team. In addition I am also tinkering away on my own projects, and am confident that my skills will help me test any business idea I have in the future much faster for for without the cost of needing to hire a developer at the very early stages! I am now able to build more complex features myself due to the great foundation from Career Foundry. Thank you!",coursereport

It's definitely a big committment and I'm struggling to keep up with the pace just a little bit with my full-time job, but it will pay off in the end.

1894,Careerfoundry,2015-07-31,"When I first encountered with the course I was excited about their Mentor-driven and Project-driven approach to teaching. It felt like what I needed to be able to do an online course. Also the price was unbeatable, and still is I think. I do have some quite minor problems with the course, but at the bottum line, only with the CareerFoundry I was able to learn programming. The biggest thing I was excited about was the mentoring part. It actually what made the difference for me. It was somebody that I could always ask questions, help me when I don't understand the material and the fact that I needed to ""satisfy"" someone was what kept me always motivated. Having said that, I was kind of dissapointed with my particular mentor. I thought he will push me outside of my box and the curriculum boundries, but it never happend. He never challanged me by his own. Another thing is that when ever I encountered with a big problem, instead of pushing me in the right direction, he just gave me the answer. At the moment, it was a great relief to see what was the right and professional way to do something, but as soon as I tried to do it by myself I realized I don't really remember/understood how he actually done that (it mostly happend in the weekly skype call, that's why I always prefred to communicate by messaging, which are always availabe as future references, but my mentor prefered to answer the big problems in the skype call). The thing is, my mentor has a vast knowledge and he is a really good teacher, just our communication wasn't perfect. The corriculum is really okay. The frontend part, is written in a fun and descreptive way which makes the learning really enjoyable. The backend part is no fun at all, mostly because it's way more technical and way more difficult. Naturally there's a lot of room for improvement in the lectures, but they are by no means in a bad shape. The CareerFoundry team is also really great. I had the chance to meet them in person more than once and they're really nice and helpful. They gave me great and valuable career advices which helped me a lot. A new thing that was started at the middle of my course, so I didn't have the chance to take advantage of, was the Slack community. A place where you can talk with fellow students, the CF team and the mentors. There a student is able to ask all kind of questions. Actually I'm still using the Slack community even though I am long after graduating. Overall, although it's not a perfect course and there's a lot of room for improvement, I really recommend this course to people who are looking for an affordable web dev course (online or not). I was actually able to take my first steps as a web developer in the industry after finishing the course, a thing that says a lot.",coursereport

The course material covered the most important topics. My mentor helped me a lot when I wanted to learn more than what the actual course contained. Throughout the course the CareerFoundry team has been really helpful and always there if I had any questions. Even after the course they were very supportive, helped me with my CV and forwarded job offers.

1896,Careerfoundry,2015-06-16,"I enjoyed my experience going thru the CF web development course. Before attending CF, I wasn’t too sure what kind of area of development I would like to specialize in. There are so many specialities, frameworks and languages out there-it can be confusing and overwhelming at first... I’m very happy I chose CF because they teach, in my opinion, a broad spectrum of the popular frameworks out there such as Bootstrap and Ruby on Rails - it really helped me understand the bigger picture of web dev. Now if only they cover mobile dev! :) I found I really enjoy the front end aspect of development, and thank CF for discovering that. Since it is self-paced they are really flexible with what you create as a project and the time frame it takes you. It’s also a pretty economical price, considering some other more intense options like Bloc and full-time online immersive type programs. However, CF is a good fit if you have yet to figure out what area of focus you want to delve into your tech career and you’re pressed on time due to a full time job, like myself.

1909,Careerfoundry,2024-06-26,"Content is very detailed (it becomes difficult once you start studying to find materials outside this course that have anything new in them) and they teach everything you need to know as a UX specialist. During the course I was blessed with great mentors and tutors that guided and supported me along the way. Currently going through the job preparation course, and I feel hard work and applying everything I know has just started. Something about the learning styles, the course is designed for the busy person that reads a bit everyday and in the order given (since they will block your access to further materials until you study the current ones) so if you like to read future material in order to understand the current one better, this can be a challenge. If you are detailed oriented, I think it would be wise to learn how to use Figma at a professional level before enrolling or as soon as you start the course, as it will become very intense once you need to use it and there are too many new design concepts you have to master and Figma can become a block in the road at times. I studied front end development in my specialisation and I appreciated the confidence it gave me to use Git and understand the code side limitations of design. Overall it was a great experience, but it takes a lot more time than expected as concepts are complex and you will need a lot of practice after you finish the course and form a portfolio.",coursereport

The Tutors are meant for day to day questions, and you can have as frequent as once a week meetings with your Mentor. CareerFoundry gets you by making the crash course super easy, and the first few lessons (after you've paid) start out easy to understand and gradually get way more complicated by the 5th lesson which is after their 14 day refund window. When I asked the Tutor for any help I needed, they would just end up repeating the homework instructions and took hours to respond. The Mentor was the only one who actually helped me when I had questions but because I could only meet with them and hour a week I could only really get though one assignment a week. I even paid for two ""extensions"" to give myself more time with the Tutors and Mentor. Eventually with all the time waiting for responses and time spent banging my head against a wall, I tried to talk to the advisors and they refused a refund except for the two extensions, even though I didn't even have access to the more expansive portion of the course. That's $7500 down the drain.",coursereport
1912,Careerfoundry,2023-12-17,"Think very hard before enrolling in this course! The promises made to you before enrolling are NOT going to be your reality. ""75 days average"" time to finding a new job. I know people that have finished the course and have been looking for a job for almost 2 years and can't even get interviews. ""Job Guarantee"" Read the fine print!!! So many stipulations to this making it almost impossible to actually qualify to get your money back. In fact, this was the first thing my mentor told me on our very first call. ""You will never see this money again."" And if you do somehow get your money back, CF washes their hands of you and you will no longer receive any sort of mentorship in the curriculum or in the job search. There was an old outcomes report floating around on their site somewhere, but it looks like it's gone now. Likely because it was a few years old and any new outcomes report is going to paint a much, much more bleak picture of the current state of the UX/UI job market. The fact of the matter is that UX/UI is insanely saturated with people coming out of bootcamps. You'll need to finish your bootcamp, complete other courses and certificates to add to your resume, volunteer your time (UNPAID) to work on projects for real clients (because nobody is going to hire you without real experience), and even then you'll still likely be considered less qualified than someone who went to a traditional college to study UX/UI. Expect to sink at least a couple years into studying and working on projects to get to a point where you'll be considered for entry level roles (not just the 5 or 6 months that CF and other bootcamps try to sell you). Let's face it, 5 or 6 months of study to get into a new line of work sounds too good to be true. And if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Nobody is hiring someone just because they've finished a bootcamp anymore. There was a time when this was the case, and that's when these bootcamps had glowing placement rates and were able to truthfully market themselves as a quick path to a new career. This is no longer even close to being the case. I'm almost finished with the course and have started applying to jobs (over 50 at this point), but haven't heard a word back on a single job app I've submitted. I expect to have to fill out at least a few hundred apps while continuing to rework my LinkedIn and resume, taking on new projects (like I said, UNPAID), and completing other training programs and courses to add to my resume. And even then, I have no confidence that I'll be working in the field anytime soon. Basically, unless you're 100% sure you want to get into the UX/UI field DO NOT ENROLL IN A BOOTCAMP OF ANY KIND. Don't enroll just because you think you're going to waltz into a glamorous remote job that pays 2x what you're making now. Essentially the only thing a bootcamp can off you anymore is a structured learning path. They can't guarantee you a job or a specific salary. Let's not forget that these bootcamps are businesses that are ultimately only concerned with making money. And how do they make money? They sell a dream to people wanting to better their lives and make a change, whether or not that dream is as realistic as they say.",coursereport
1913,Careerfoundry,2023-12-05,"Trying to learn from this curriculum is like trying to learn to read, but the instructors only tell you about the alphabet they don't actually tell you what each letter sounds like, or how to put them together in sounds. They tell you what to do, but not how to do it. They use 10,000 words and make things way more complicated when 100 words would do. You end up having to use google and youtube to teach yourself. On top of that the tutors and mentors they promise are useless. They are working from a script. They just send you links when you have questions instead of answering directly. Most of the time the links don't even answer your questions, they are just the links CF has told them to send for that section. Mentors you have to schedule time to do a video call with in order to get help from them. They can be helpful, but it is a phone call. You can't reference back to it. The career prep people are the same. Working off a script, and not helpful. Save your money. Go with Data camp, or W3schools you're going to be using them anyway to get through CF's course.

To dip my toes into the UX waters, I embarked on their introductory course, which further solidified my resolve to commit to their full-fledged UX Designer course. One of the aspects that immediately drew me in was the course's self-paced nature, offering me flexibility in my learning journey. The course materials, brimming with depth and detail, have proven to be a wellspring of knowledge, making complex concepts remarkably accessible. The UX Designer course is a testament to careful planning, with an emphasis on even the minutest of details. As I steadily progress through the course, I find myself growing in confidence and expertise. I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to my Tutor, Thania Soetandar, whose guidance has been invaluable, and my Mentor, Jia Liang, whose support has been unwavering throughout this transformative learning experience.

I’ve been able to gain and practice design skills and gain an insight into the role of a UX designer. The tasks have been challenging but taught in bite-sized, easy to understand chunks so it’s never felt not do-able or overwhelming. The one thing I would say is that it would be great if there was more integration between learning how to use different design software and the course content. Having learnt how to use software from scratch independently, it was initially challenging to both learn how to use these tools and learn with them, producing work that you can get valuable feedback on.",coursereport

It's a go at-your-own-speed system, so if the customer service are not there, then mind as well watch youtube videos and learn for free. The Admin are nice and sounds like they care, but they never respond directly to the questions and try to avoid scheduling times to actually problem solve. Imagine signing up with a school that's a worse experience than studying at DMV. I would say the efficiency, clarity and care of the Admin here is half of the experience at DMV.

1936,Careerfoundry,2023-05-22,"My experience overall was positive. I obtained skills that I used to brand myself and succeed in a UX role. I especially liked having mentorship throughout the program. I wish that my course mentor was available during my job hunt period because there were numerous times that I wanted industry specific advice that I only thought of once applying for jobs. My job prep mentor was great, however, for some of the UX specific questions that occurred to me, I would need my course mentor to help with. My job preparation mentor was very helpful to me. I found that the structure of the course made sense, however, at times it was a bit frustrating. For instance, early on in the Intro to UX course, one task asked me to prepare a career path for myself. But at this time, being new to UX I had no idea what career paths exist in UX. I found that there were times in the course where a task was asked of me and then during the following course readings it would explain relevant information that would have been helpful to complete them. Task 1.6 in ""Thinking like a UXer"", Claire uses her user research to come up with a problem statement so I wondered if that meant that I had to do a quick competitive analysis, or even user interviews? I confirmed with my tutor that I did not, and she told me that my problem statement should be based on assumptions. I found this a bit confusing because I have been learning in this course that we should be wary of our own assumptions. I think it should be strongly encouraged to record interviews in task 2.2 because while conducting the interviews I wasn't as focused on preparing information and data in the format that task 2.3 would eventually ask me to do. *Keep in mind, these are notes about the course that I took while going through it. Having discussed this with multiple other CareerFoundry students, task structure is a common frustration. It is possible that CareerFoundry has already made changes to these issues.* One additional point - Although I enjoyed having a tutor to approve my tasks and to provide feedback and advice, I also found that her answers were somewhat templative. It felt like she the feedback she gave me was somewhat generic and could have applied to many students completing the assignment. At times I wondered how thoroughly she read through my tasks. Having said this, I did value her feedback, and there were times when she provided very helpful feedback. She was also specific with answers when I reached out and asked her questions.",coursereport
1937,Careerfoundry,2023-05-18,"I'll evaluate this bit by bit: Course material: It's all reading. There are some videos from time to time but 90% of the course load will be reading. If you're the type to need a video or live sessions this bootcamp is not for you. I feel the way they introduce React in the 3rd chapter is way too complicated. It goes right to the giant project with like 6-8 components. As a complete beginner this was utterly confusing..I almost had no idea what I was doing. My tutor did help me break it down a bit but I found myself learning way better working on small project tutorials on Youtube where they did a simple React project to introduce its basic functions. I also felt like they rushed the jQuery section with the Pokemon API...not enough time was spent on it and at the end of the chapter I still had no idea what I was doing. (4/10) Tutor/Mentor: I learned not to completely rely on them and try to find my own solutions online or slack channel because they can take 24-48 hours to reply and that is way too long for me. If I want a bug fixed I want assistance as soon as I can. Now this is not their fault since CareerFoundry allows them a 24-48 hour window to reply but even if they reply a few short messages, I get ghosted a couple times so the bug took a week to finally fix. It sounds frustrating but without them I would not have survived this bootcamp. (7/10) Career services: My career specialist is very nice and supporting. She is probably the best part of the program but there is only so much she can do. CareerFoundry does not partner up with any employers in your area. They occasionally post jobs on their website but it's mostly based in Europe. I live in Canada so I'm out of luck. They provide a list of websites which are free resources to encourage us to check out. I was really hoping CareerFoundry would give us direct connection to employers looking for junior web developers like other bootcamps do but they don't. Career Specialist (9/10) Career Services (3/10) Job hunt: I've been actively job hunting for 4 months and zero luck. Not even an interview. Maybe it's the worst timing out there due to the massive tech layoffs but at the end of the day, I still don't have a job. Overall: I chose Careerfoundry because it was the cheapest of all the bootcamps plus I get to work at my own pace and not locked down to mandatory live classes on Saturdays ( I work Saturdays) but I kind of regret that choice now...I can't speak for their UI/UX courses but I do not recommend them for their web development. I feel like I didn't get what I paid for.",coursereport

I can go to either of them with questions and they respond usually within the same day, if not by the next. My mentor is available to help with all sorts of things and provides encouragement when I feel lost. I can book calls with my mentor and he will share his expertise in the field.

To my surprise all my assignments were approved upon first submission with very little critical feedback. When I asked for feedback, I was given small things I could change about my work. So, I assumed I was doing well. I completed the course and began applying for job and networking. I found mentors in the industry who told that what was taught in this program did not match industry standards and that without any experience in the field it’s hard to get a job. Additionally, I kept trying to get advice about my job search which a year out, I still dont have a job. I was told to just keep applying and never given very much feedback on my materials. I’m now trying to piece together all the things I was not taught and finding outside mentorship and coaching. I contacted career support and they just told me they don’t know what the problem is because others are successful at finding jobs. I spoke to other alumni of the program that are struggling to so not sure where these success stories are.

1960,Careerfoundry,2022-11-16,"The course is extremely fast paced, and it's really easy to fall behind if you have work or school at the same time as this bootcamp. However, I've had good experiences contacting the student advisors because they are very understanding of my situation and would help me get back on track. My tutor approves my tasks with some pretty generic/nonspecific feedback, sometimes I'm not sure if I'm really understanding the scope of the lesson because I don't get much constructive criticism, which makes me unsure if I'm really prepared for the industry afterwards. The mentor does give pretty concise and constructive criticism which helps make up for that weakness. Overall, very challenging for my design & time management skills.",coursereport
1961,Careerfoundry,2022-10-13,"After college I felt a bit stuck because I knew I didn't want to attend grad school nor did I want to work entry level positions forever. After some research I found my field of interest (UI Design) and found CareerFoundry. So far I am incredibly impressed with the skills I have developed and how much I have learned in these past couple of months. It is incredibly impressive to go from not knowing anything in the field and finishing the course with a full polished portfolio, that was curated with the help of a tutor and a mentor. So far, no regrets!",coursereport
1962,Careerfoundry,2022-09-22,"Overall, I've really enjoyed my time at CareerFoundry. I have learned so much and had amazing support and guidance from my tutor, mentor, counselors, and the community of peers!!",coursereport
1963,Careerfoundry,2022-08-31,"Although CareerFoundry does offer multiple bootcamps, I have personally only taken the UX one and have had a wonderful experience. They offer in-depth material and give students tasks that help build knowledge. Along with the material, CareerFoundry gives students a tutor that is always a text message away and a mentor who is experienced in the field. Additionally, everyone's response time is quick and fast and they are always trying to help us get the best experience. They also have zoom meetings with people around the world giving their experiences in the UX field and also have many resources to make sure their students get everything possible out of this Bootcamp.",coursereport
1964,Careerfoundry,2022-08-31,"Overall, I am incredibly satisfied with the program. It is a self-paced but the program offers guidance on how to pace oneself whether you choose to participate part or full time. Your tutor/mentor are always giving productive and helpful feedback to help you improve. My personal favorite part is how the lessons are so bite size. You read about a new exercise, directly implement that into the task of the day. This is all being gathered to build the main piece of the achievement and overarching project. I think it's a great practical and hands-on approach to learning.",coursereport
1965,Careerfoundry,2022-08-15,CareerFoundry is the perfect course for those who feel they need someone to help you along the way and not make you feel alone. The tutoring is fantastic and the things you learn are many and well organized.,coursereport

1967,Careerfoundry,2022-08-02,"I had a wonderful experience studying through CareerFoundry. I loved that it was all online and flexible. I was able to do it in my own time and at my own pace. I had two excellent mentors/tutors, who were always available to help with extra questions and advice. The free Job Preparation Course also helped immensely in preparing me for the job market and sending out professional applications. It also gave me the opportunity to set up a website that serves as my portfolio. All in all a great school that goes the extra mile. And I got a job in a foreign country where I don't even speak the language properly within 4 months of finishing - with zero previous data analysis experience (I am a career changer from speech therapy to data analytics)!",coursereport

1969,Careerfoundry,2022-07-13,The course is designed to immerse the student on a work journey through completing small to medium tasks almost every day. It delivers some security that the curriculum will prepare you for the work environment and mostly to get a job right after finishing it. The feedbacks on the tasks are encouraging but you can see it could be improved with a more personal approach rather than ready made texts. The graphics for the exercises can be improved.,coursereport
1970,Careerfoundry,2022-06-28,I have jumped into new career UX designing in my 40. I was scared at first but the course and career foundry team is excellent.Soon i will start my job prep course.

1971,Careerfoundry,2022-06-27,"Overall a fantastic program if you're willing to put in the work! The student experience is highly dependent on the tutor and mentor you happen to be assigned— so just something to keep in mind. Student support via the student advising team was excellent. Lastly, I've had one interaction with two different career specialists and both were a bit disappointing because I didn't really feel supported— but hopefully just an anomaly! Still, I would highly recommend this program.",coursereport

1978,Careerfoundry,2022-05-24,"I just graduated from the FullStack immersion course, There is no any Job guarantee cause they blocked me for no reasons after I finished the Course. I kept the whole course working on my own cause they could not hire any Good Tutors. The Mentors of the Job prep. is not related to the course, I advice anyone who wants to learn Full-Stack Immersion to join a professional Boot Camp to get a real knowledge to find a job.",coursereport
1979,Careerfoundry,2022-04-27,"On the surface Career Foundry looked great. Reasonable pricing, self-paced, walk away with 2 portfolio-ready projects. I signed up and hit the ground running. The introduction course was very good. Took a couple of weeks to complete and gave you a good sense of the UX design process. However, once you get to the main UX Immersion course, that's when things start going downhill. This is a long, drawn-out course. There are so many filler exercises that are there just to make the course feel more substantial. When you boil everything down, really you're mostly just relearning what was learned in the introduction course. There are many tasks such as describing what your ethical values are which I found to be an eye-rolling experience. It would have been better if they scraped these filler tasks that don't actually contribute anything to your final project and focused more on fleshing out your product. The course only requires you to design 3 main features within your product. Most of the products I have seen coming out of this course feel largely unfinished. The worst part of this program is the tutor/mentor system. Most of your exercises are reviewed by your tutor. My tutor was very helpful when needed. They were quick to mark my work and gave some snippets of valuable insight here and there. The mentor only marks the final exercise of each module of which there are 5. This is where the major problems started happening. I had a tutor who was directing me one way only to get to the mentor who disagreed with their direction and wanted me to redo a load of work that I had already completed just to please the mentor. The majority of the mentor's feedback felt conceited, rather than helpful. As though they were trying to validate their position there. I have spoken with other students who had the same frustrations. In my opinion, it would make more sense to get rid of the mentor system they have and leave it to the tutors. The mentors feel tagged on and are there as more of an obstacle than anything. Ultimately interaction with actual tutors/mentors is kept to be very minimal. Your time is spent reading the course materials and working through the exercises by yourself. Overall I am not quite sure if I am happy that I purchased this course. I would think twice before recommending it to a friend.",coursereport
1980,Careerfoundry,2022-03-23,"The online school offers practical, market-ready knowledge in a fairly reasonable time. The mentors, tutors and other advisors are helpful to support students along the way. The overall curriculum is practical and straight-forward, although sometimes are a bit confusing, but does not block to make overall progress. The only drawback is that a student basically has to make progress alone, but once you learn how to do that you will find only benefits. The satisfaction guarantee seems reasonable and provides remedy for scepticism regarding the online format if you have any. (Imagine a university refunding a horror fee if you cannot find a job.)",coursereport
1981,Careerfoundry,2022-03-10,"CareerFoundry has been very helpful in getting me acclimated to industry standard design practice. I do believe that what you put in is what you get out but the mentors, teachers and advisors are here to help you however they can. The slack channel is also helpful to connect with other students. I am appreciative of the help I’ve gotten throughout my course and I can’t wait to start applying and becoming a professional UX designer!",coursereport
1982,Careerfoundry,2022-03-10,"Currently enrolled in the UX Design course and so far it's been great! You go at your own pace, but the program will also suggest how many tasks to submit to stay on track. The content is broken down into parts and the tasks reflect what you just learned. (There are some tasks that require participants / user input, so completing those may take longer if you have to coordinate availability with friends/family/people on the CF Slack community.) Sometimes I feel like there could be more examples / guides for the tasks, but your tutor (and mentor) is always there to help when you're stuck or have any questions at all. They've been super resourceful, encouraging, and communicative. It's definitely a lot of work, especially trying to stay on track for a self-paced course, but I do highly recommend CareerFoundry if you're determined to learn UX!",coursereport
1983,Careerfoundry,2022-03-10,"Students sign up for the UX immersion course and are enrolled in the 4-week introduction course before they start the immersion course. The introduction course throws students into the entire UX design process so that students get an overview of the entire process before the immersion starts. The immersion program starts off very slow and picks up after going through the history of UX. The company promises a job guarantee, and there is some confusion about the details of the guarantee. The job prep course doesn't open until students are 50% of the way through the course, and students must complete the job prep course in order to be eligible for the job guarantee. Make up your own mind about this! The career services team does not help students until they get into the job prep course.",coursereport
1984,Careerfoundry,2022-03-10,"I am attending UX Design Course at CareerFoundry. This a hands-on course based on learn-by-application approach. This course is separated in 3 parts, first is Intro, second Immersion and third is Specialisation, there is also mentorship and tutoring provided as well as vast student community. I am in Immersion part now and so far I am pretty pleased with it. But, there is some room for improvement, here's what I've noticed: - Some parts seem a bit dated (ex. technology wise - some recommended software are not in use anymore, or resources wise - some websites are also not available anymore) - A lot of times, there is a short description of the task and then it feels like we are left hanging and we need to know how to do it. Mostly it requires a lot more research on our part (I don't mind researching, but it takes a lot of time) - Not all of us have a new or great idea about our project app, so if there is some way to help generate ideas in the beginning, that would be great - Some tasks are too large versus others, it sometimes creates a nice balance, but some should be separated (ex. interviews and surveys - students opt not to do the survey because it takes a lot of time along with interviews) - At the beginning of the course I've felt immediately overwhelmed (even though I knew some terms and phrases used in UX) as it offers a lot of information without easing into it (a way to make the students feel less overwhelmed, at least in the beginning) - It would be beneficial if there was more accent on what is important and what we should pay extra intention in doing the tasks (ex. on what details should we pay extra attention in competitive analysis). And maybe an explanation on why we are doing tasks in this order (sometimes the order is not logical). That's all folks!",coursereport
1985,Careerfoundry,2022-03-10,This course is 100% online and flexibly paced which has been great for my learning as I work full time as a graphic designer.

I highly recommend CareerFoundry who is looking for a new career change. All the mentors, tutors and other staffs are super kind and supportive. Whenever I have a questions, they are always there for me and provide me with very rich resources. Even though it is an online course where I can manage my own timing, the time guideline helps me to stay on track and the staff always checks on me to provide help. Thank you CareerFoundry.",coursereport
1989,Careerfoundry,2022-02-17,"My experience at CareerFoundry has been good so far. Because this is an online course, it requires a lot of discipline, hard work from students, and can feel isolating. CF is very organized as course materials are easily accessible and follow. Exercises are simple, but sometimes too simple, where it doesn’t explain the subject well enough for you to fully understand. Not everything that you need to learn will be taught by CF, like design software, so you’ll have to learn on your own. At 70% into the course, I feel that I don’t know enough and still have a lot of outside learning that I need to do in order to prepare myself for interviews. So, one thing I’ve learned is that it takes discipline and hard word to complete the CF successfully. Therefore, start everything that you’re supposed to do early when you’re advised to do so. Staff members are very responsive. It isn’t easy, but it will be rewarding when you land the job that you wanted.",coursereport
1990,Careerfoundry,2022-02-17,"Simply put, CareerFoundry's UX Design course is a great way to build a solid foundation in User Experience Design. Having recently graduated university with a degree unrelated to UX, I had a desire to learn the fundamentals and the CareerFoundry course has made me feel like I'm learning the necessary skills and becoming equipped with the tools needed to enter the industry.",coursereport
1991,Careerfoundry,2022-02-17,"The course is well structured but could improve on certain aspects: the first trial period or BootCamp is too fast to make a good work out of it. You rush in between things, 3 weeks on working days are 15 days. The lesson and the task are not in-depth, but then the result must be. In my opinion, the tutor needs things as they should be and not as ""easily"" explained in the short lesson before the tasks. The help desk never really helped me More realistic times for task. It says it can take up to 3 days to do a task but still, the progress shows you you can accomplish 3 tasks a week. Interview questions and presentations instead of videos made with real people. Interaction with other students made monthly, maybe some extra classes online or something not to be always answering your own questions. Pretty Good things are: Tutor and mentor access and help Overall classes content Slack Community Examples of tasks accepted before yours Job preparation course",coursereport

I feel I have learn a lot just within these past 4 months and it works with my schedule. It's self-project based with a deadline, but I was feeling overwhelmed with work and started to trail behind a little and my tutor kept my spirits up and the student advisors even helped me out with extensions. I am excited to explore more that adds to my knowledge and portfolio and see where things lead towards the end of the program!",coursereport
1995,Careerfoundry,2021-11-30,I have a learnt a lot from currently studying with Career Foundry so far. The course content and the support from Tutor and Mentor are amazing and helpful.

Not only do I feel like the material is well laid out and comprehensive, but CareerFoundry has given me so many resources from advisors, a tutor, a mentor and a community that I can turn to when I need support.",coursereport
1999,Careerfoundry,2021-11-29,The curriculum of the program is ok- it follows a good tempo and covers interesting topics. What I find great is that we can put in practice what we are learning straight away. On the other side- the tutors are absolutely clueless when it comes to solving issues on the way or explaining anything in more detail. Usually their answers involve some YouTube videos which they advise you to watch and mostly never answer your question directly or even try to understand what you are experiencing difficulties with. Maybe cut off the tutors and leave only the mentors for this program? One of the things I find really not efficient is that feedback is asked ALL the time. However when you would provide constructive feedback with examples to the student advisors all their answers are extremely defensive and somehow they would always tell you to schedule a call with your mentor- this seems to be the most common solution for all problems.,coursereport
2000,Careerfoundry,2021-11-16,"Hey! I think that sometimes the course could be more practical, with more videos showing how to use some of the tools instead. The instructors are very nice, their feedback is always helpful in many ways. And even if the job assistance is good, it could be improved by having more direct contact with the supplier's support team to avoid any miscommunication.",coursereport

The support from the student advisors, mentors, and tutors is amazing, I couldn't have asked for a better program.",coursereport
2005,Careerfoundry,2021-10-18,"CareerFoundry does a great job with their curriculum. They provide you with good amounts of basic design theory coupled with hands-on assignments. However, many of the assignments felt like busy work. I would have rather worked on portfolio pieces in each section than arbitrary assignments that won’t see the light of day after they’ve been submitted. That being said, there already is a substantial amount of work that you’ll need to put into your portfolio piece during the UX immersion course. You should walk away with at least one solid piece from the bootcamp considering you’re given a few months to work on it. Also speaking of the portfolio pieces - it’s promised that you will walk away with 3 projects, but I found the first piece you work on in the intro class to be a bit too simple to put on your portfolio. I am about to start the third piece and am hopeful that it will be substantial enough. I was really attracted to the mentoring aspect of the bootcamp, but I found myself relying on outside mentorship early on. The adverts promise mentors who are highly experienced and who work at recognizable companies, but both my mentors really had only started their UX journeys within the last few years. Not to diminish their accomplishments and experience, but I would be much more comfortable with mentors who have at least 5 years of dedicated UX experience - not a mixture of Graphic design or fine arts and some UX. For example one of my mentors had only graduated from the same bootcamp only a year a half before I started. Overall, I found that the bootcamp has taught me quite a bit about design principles and general practices within the industries. Though I do have some buyer’s remorse from the mentorship and the lack of portfolio pieces you will get out of the course.",coursereport

2007,Careerfoundry,2021-10-18,It's been almost three months since I started the UX design course and I cannot find a reason not recommending it. I am in constant communication with my tutor and I have weekly meetings with my Mentor. Both of them send me a lot of additional resources to read and advice on how to improve my work. Another thing I love about this course is the flexibility that I have to read and do assignments whenever I have time.,coursereport
2008,Careerfoundry,2021-10-18,This is the best learning experience that I had in my life. People at CareerFoundry are extremely friendly and are always there to help you with whatever questions or problems you could have. This changed my vision about learning. 5* and hand down.,coursereport

My mentor at CareerFoundry has been very supportive, encouraging, and helpful.",coursereport
2010,Careerfoundry,2021-08-27,"UX Design Immersion Course and UI Specialization - overall the course provides a general and basic background of UX, but does not seem to provide enough foundational information that is necessary. Example is they touch on ""accessibility"" but have 1 paragraph on it during the actual coursework and most of the info I had to google and learn elsewhere. The tutors are OK and seem to have a pre-determined cut and paste response format that is provided to them on how they respond to your tasks. I had to switch mentors due to scheduling issues and both are so-so at best. A lot of the course work and studies is the effort you put in to do the extra learning outside of the base of what's provided. They keep telling you to use the slack channel and to reach out to student advisors, but the student advisor question submit is responded by bots and isn't helpful when you just want to reach out to someone about your personal case. The delay in response could be due to the time difference between the US and Germany, but I definitely do not like the slack format as it is chaotic to follow.",coursereport
2011,Careerfoundry,2021-08-25,I have started to UX Design Program. It is not even my second month yet but I have learned a lot.

Prior to the course, I had a small amount knowledge of UX Design through my past job and this course has helped me understand it much more, particularly with the tools we used in User Research, so I can see how it can be applied to a real-life UX role. I like the structure and consistent pace of the course as well as working on the project. My tutor and mentor respond to me in good time and I find the mentor sessions valuable, encouraging and supportive. I'd really recommend it particularly if you can put all your efforts into it. I'm currently working full-time as well as studying and have found it challenging but it's completely doable if you're very focused and keep the balance.",coursereport

2027,Careerfoundry,2021-06-14,"I have started Careerfundry’s course last November. I have gained so much confidence from my mentor and tutor. I really enjoy learning and doing what I really love, which is UX design. I can see Careerfundry is going to help me to get the job I always wanted especially with their job preparation program, their customers services, course structures are all very much appreciated.",coursereport
2028,Careerfoundry,2021-06-12,"This course has not been what I expected. Neither the tutoring nor mentoring has met expectations, and the course content hasn't been anything special either. I haven't enjoyed using the platform either. The chat function is frustrating and audio functionality for the text is poor.",coursereport
2029,Careerfoundry,2021-06-11,It is my first experience studying remotly & I feel very well taken care off. At times it is nicely challenging and there are always very qualified tutors and mentors to answer questions and to support the progress of the course! I can highly recomend it!,coursereport
2030,Careerfoundry,2021-06-09,"Since March 29th, 2021 I opted in for a UX design course in CareerFoundry I have found it absolutely amazing. I love the structure of the course - they are well detailed and easy to understand. However, my Mentor and Tutor guiding me through this program have been helpful. They are intelligent, experienced, and time conscious to correcting of course tasks. I would recommend careerFoundry to prospective students irrespective of the choice of program. Moreover, the opportunity of supporting students to achieve his/her dream job. That means if you're unemployed and you are looking for an educative platform that will make your dream come through- CareerFoundry is the best for YOU!",coursereport
2031,Careerfoundry,2021-06-02,"Very supportive and helpful. Responses are very fast, most of time within 48 hours.

Very recommend to all of you who are interested in UX Design.",coursereport
2032,Careerfoundry,2021-06-02,I’ve been studying the UX Design course (almost done) with CareerFoundry and it has been amazing. Everyone has been so supportive and helpful.

It's been a great exploration of the fundamentals of conducting a descriptive analysis, and using Excel. The quality of feedback from my tutor has been incredible, and I've loved the relevant, contemporary examples used in the curriculum.",coursereport
2037,Careerfoundry,2021-05-20,"Pros: - Website: Ok - Service: Helpful and quick reply. But when about job related? Sadly not good due to different local market - Slack community: Met some interesting fellows Cons: - Curriculum: Not good enough to get a junior position. Video explanation? The instruction is too plain / strong accent - hardly to understand sometimes. Too much writing and quite confusing sometimes. - Job preparation: Too strict and too American way. Can't help much to get job locally. - Job guarantee: Possible, if you are willing to start unpaid internship or earning super mega low salary (not enough monthly living) Suggestion: Do free online source - as employers don't ask for certificate at the end. If someone want to do a course at Careerfoundry, they should do UX/UI course - they are very good for this. But not other courses.",coursereport
2038,Careerfoundry,2021-05-20,"The best part of the UX Design Program with CareerFoundry (and what made me choose them), is that you can choose your own pace. You have a deadline, true, but it´s established doing the minimum weekly hours of study. Also important is that you spend all the time during your program working on practical projects. So yes, there is a lot to read and digest, but putting everything automatically into practice makes it much more dynamic. Not only that, you are building your portfolio from the very first day. They offer support through a Tutor and a Mentor during the whole Program, which is amazing to avoid the feeling of being ""alone"" the whole way. They can answer your questions and give you a hand when you get stuck. The only thing to mention here is that I have seen different kinds or levels of support and commitment between Tutors/Mentors of different students. This human difference can create as well a big difference in the experience that each student has through the program. However, the Bootcamp has an Advisor Team that is available for issues like this. The overall experience for a person that has no previous knowledge in the field is quite positive. Sometimes the content of each lesson could be polished to be more consistent in between the different steps of the lessons, or even through the progress of the personal project, but I am aware that they are constantly improving it. A more than positive experience!",coursereport
2039,Careerfoundry,2021-05-19,Career Foundry has given me the skills and confidence I need to change careers. I’m excited to become a UX designer with the help of Career Foundry!,coursereport
2040,Careerfoundry,2021-05-19,"I took a chance on this course after thinking about changing careers for so long. Before making my decision I spoke to a representative from Career Foundry and an online school in my area in Colorado. Career Foundry offered more flexibility, they were approachable, and have been so caring during my course. I feel they look out for their students throughout the course. I really enjoy getting feedback from my tutor and mentor because they know what is needed from students in the industry and are on top of UI trends.",coursereport
2041,Careerfoundry,2021-05-19,"A very good course with a project-based learning approach, with tutors and mentors on a 1-to-1 basis. And a great community of peers to stay motivated and get help.",coursereport
2042,Careerfoundry,2021-04-26,"As someone working in the UX design field, I wanted to expand my skill set and learn more about UI (I already had some fundamental knowledge, but wanted a more of a deep-dive experience). The course gave me exactly what I expected. I also received a lot of feedback and support from my mentor and tutor -- this was extremely valuable for me! Since I wasn’t looking for a job, I didn’t take advantage of the career support offered on the course, but have no doubt that if I had, it would have been as great as all the other services offered.",coursereport
2043,Careerfoundry,2021-04-26,"The UX Design Program with CareerFoundry allowed me to successfully transition into the UX design field without any prior knowledge on UX. I’ve studied and worked in the data science field for many years before I decided that I want to change my career path where my creative and visual aspirations could be met. The career change process wasn’t easy for me, as I’ve already reached a certain seniority level in the data science field and starting from scratch in a new role meant not only needing to learn a lot of new information/concepts, but also a step back salary-wise. The main reason why I’ve decided to go with CareerFoundry’s program was because it allowed me to learn a new skill while continuing to work at a full-time job. This flexibility was exactly what I needed. Additionally, I was intrigued by the 1-on-1 mentorship support provided. Overall, I am more than satisfied with my experience at CareerFoundry. Not only did I enjoy the learning process, but I also got all the qualifications needed to get a new job -- I got an offer as a UX researcher shortly after graduating.",coursereport
2044,Careerfoundry,2021-04-23,"This was a really great starting point for someone completely new to UI design — like myself! By the end of the course I had a set of pixel-perfect mockups for a pretty sweet looking travel app. I worked predominantly with Sketch (but there was also the option to use Adobe XD). I think what made the course so good was the seamless interaction with my CareerFoundry mentor and tutor — they really gave a lot of valuable tips and feedback — but also insights into life as a UI designer working in the field. I also think the live events that CareerFoundry hosts are pretty inspiring, and there's a genuine sense of community and support. Would totally recommend :)",coursereport
2045,Careerfoundry,2021-04-22,"My mentors were great and very helpful. I finished my program in 3 months when on average, it can take people a year. I really worked hard in it and I know I did a great job because I loved my projects and designs, and so did my mentors. I believe they even used some of my work as examples to show future students. I really enjoyed the program and the tasks since I come from a design background. The whole reason why I joined the program was because one of the employees told me that CareerFoundry would send me all the jobs to apply to since when you look to apply, all the UI positions require experience. This was something I was concerned about because I didn't want to pay $6k of my hard-earned savings just to end up applying to a bunch of jobs that were way out of my league. Anyway, of course they didn't end up doing that and when I asked my job application mentor about that promise the employee had made me, he said there was no such thing. So it did end up being the worst possible outcome, which was still no UI job, no $6k, and no help from CareerFoundry. Do not sign up for this program. They taught me a lot, but that doesn't help me if I can't even get a job in the field. There are other programs that don't make you pay until you get a job, and in my situation you would've been better off learning the material yourself and saving your $6k to end up with no UI job anyway. Shoutout to Craig for being the best mentor though and really helping me to push myself.",coursereport
2046,Careerfoundry,2021-04-16,"Instructor's feedback's were very helpful for completing the course successfully. I really like the course structure,which is based on learning by doing approach.",coursereport
2047,Careerfoundry,2021-04-08,"I have worked for a number of years in higher education, and have been part of numerous online learning projects. From my perspective, the CareerFoundry program is astonishingly well curated and presented, and has been very effective for me in learning a large number of new skills in a relatively short time. The course is well supported by dedicated and experienced teachers who look closely at all of your work, and you are constantly receiving feedback to help you learn and improve. The best part of the course design is that you really do learn by doing – there is very little theory-only content. You actually will make a lot of stuff throughout every part of the course, which not only feels like a great accomplishment but is also, in my experience, the most effective way to learn. I have learnt a ton on this course and would very highly recommend it. I have only just begun the job assistance component so can't yet give it an honest review, but from what I have gathered so far it is also a very thorough part of the program and is well supported by dedicated career mentors. I expect this will be a fruitful part of the experience.",coursereport
2048,Careerfoundry,2021-03-06,"In the Careerfoundry UI Course, I was able to learn further than what I learned on UI online tutorials. I already know about UX, and it is filling exactly the gap I needed for changing careers. The course is well structured, and I have an amazing tutor and a wonderful mentor pushing me further to do better and better designs, taking me out of my comfort zone. Besides, you are then also part of a very active and supportive tech community. I could not recommend this course more!",coursereport
2049,Careerfoundry,2021-02-26,"Data Analytics intro course has been brilliant, the exercises and tasks have been really useful, linked to the real world and work.

Focus on data-driven UX methodology with comprehensive, hands-on training including: -User Research -User Journeys & User Personas -Competitive Analysis -Surveys & Interviews -Information Architecture -Wireframing -Prototyping and Conversion Rate Optimization -Usability Testing I would definitely recommend this program. The mentors and tutors are excellent and really want you to succeed! You learn a lot throughout the course and each assignment is hands-on.",coursereport
2052,Careerfoundry,2021-02-07,"Overall, it is a well-crafted introductory immersion into the world of UX design (after all, the real learning will come from doing it on the job). I just wish they offered a UX Writing specialization. Also, the instructors were hit or miss. I think some of them just copy-and-paste boilerplate feedback and don't really look at your work. One of mine seemed to have no awareness of what my assignments were or where I was in the course. But the curriculum is enough on its own, if you're comfortable learning via written instruction and videos. The job assistance is stellar, providing tons of valuable guidance, practice, and personalized support.",coursereport
2053,Careerfoundry,2021-01-21,"CareerFoundry is one of the best UX/UI design programs online! The reason I chose it was mainly due to the time flexibility and opportunity for networking. They allow you to start whenever you're ready, and every student can go at their own pace. They give you a mentor, a tutor, another mentor for the job prep course, student advisors, and an entire Slack community so you can get to know other students. People also share a lot of resources there, especially for online job hunt/career-related events. Their lessons are pretty good too. They have links to helpful articles and video lessons sometimes too. Any questions I have outside of the lessons, I can ask my mentor (we have weekly video calls and I can Slack message him any time). Oh and my tutor always always gives me helpful articles to look at along with her feedback on my assignments. Overall, I'd say the program is very good!",coursereport
2054,Careerfoundry,2020-12-02,I am really happy about my experience at CareerFoundry. The help of my tutor is invaluable and the course is super valid and makes me confident about my next career!,coursereport
2055,Careerfoundry,2020-11-24,"It was a good choice but challenging. Thanks to this course, I could get not only knowledge for the professional UX design, but also train myself in terms of being disciples. One thing that I really want to tell is that tutor is not always good. I met Carlo J.C.M. van der Pluijm as my tutor. He looked down me and ignored my words. So I asked a student advisor to change my tutor and they changed my tutor, who is really nice and professional. Overall, I highly recommended this course. Course material is also reliable and student's community is a huge network all around the world. The end of the course, You will have the option to choose 'job preparation course', which helps you prepare a resume, etc. All the process is well organised and prepared. Just bring your strong will.",coursereport
2056,Careerfoundry,2020-10-29,"My time with Careerfoundry has been mainly positive. The structure of the overall course and transitions from each assignment (deliverable) is very organized and meaningful. Your assigned tutors are really a great resource to have. I will say that, as of today, about 80% done with the UX immersion course...I do not necessarily feel job ready. I do however feel I've gained a lot of valuable exposure and experience across many facets of UX and even UI. Yet I still personally feel I've got a ways to go before I find that genuine confidence to enter the job market, thats for sure! I will say, I do not necessarily agree with or rely on the time estimations for course work. In fact, I've spent a WHOLE LOT more time and dedication than they let off from the get go...which isn't a bad thing...but would have liked more transparency from the beggining to be honest.. As a complete rookie, this has been quite the challenge (to say the least) It's not easy stuff, and for the most part you're genuinely kind of on your own to keep up with the pace. I am grateful for the layout of the program and the support from both my tutor and mentor, but there's still leaps and bounds to overcome.. Progress never pefection...",coursereport

Personally I was new to every design themes and I didn't imagine to learn so much within such a short period of time. It's an intense course but on top to the skillset you get, it really helps you to start thinking as a designer and gives you enough confidence to start something new.",coursereport

Help is always available whether it’s from your assigned tutor or mentor, and you can also reach out and even collaborate with other students to help get your assignments finished. It feels like a real school environment, which I was a little worried about with working only online- but it’s been great in keeping me on track and motivated. Would recommend!",coursereport
2062,Careerfoundry,2020-09-10,"I think bootcamps are what you make out of it. I have prior graphic design experience so the curriculum was pretty easy for me. I found that my instructors kind of glanced over my work, so unless I gave specific questions, my assignments got approved. I supplemented my bootcamp with alot of online workshops and meetups because I thought the assignments were kind of dry/beginnerish. Plus side is being able to follow a timeline. I know if I were to study on my own, I would get lost with the plethora of materials on the internet. My advice to anyone looking for a bootcamp is to make sure you know that you'll have to take a hold of your education and make sure you put in the work to make your portfolio shine. You aren't gonna get spoonfed a job with the job guarantee. You really do need to work for it.",coursereport
2063,Careerfoundry,2020-09-09,The course was very detailed and thought out. My tutor and mentor made it enjoyable since I knew I was getting real feedback from people in the industry.,coursereport
2064,Careerfoundry,2020-09-02,"I have enrolled in the Full-Stack Web Development Program this year, and so far my experience has been great! What made me choose CareerFoundry over an in-house bootcamp was the flexibility to study when I want and have the time for it, as I am working a full-time job. Another factor was the price, at is is significantly cheaper than most other in-house bootcamps I found. Each student gets assigned a mentor and tutor to help with the course progress, and I've had very good luck with mine. They're helpful and give me the insight I need to improve and think like a web developer. During the course, you get to work on projects that will ultimately be your portfolio, so you will be ready to apply for jobs by the time you graduated. The only con I would say is that you need to be disciplined and motivate yourself to keep going at a steady pace. No one is there to tell you to do it. However, the flexibility that comes with it also makes many things easier! I definitely recommend this program for people who want to keep their full-time job!",coursereport
2065,Careerfoundry,2020-08-24,Do not waste your money on this people. They will rip you off. They will talk to you nice to make you enroll after that you will realize their realness. Bad staff and service. Their tutors and mentors will not help you as they suppose to and if you do not make your deadline to finish course they will charge you $1000 per month and will not give extension even at their fault. BE CAREFUL. TOTAL FRAUD.,coursereport

2069,Careerfoundry,2020-07-09,"I loved taking the CareerFoundry UX Design Program. The Exercises were really interesting, if you are interested in psychology and how the human mind works you'll actually really enjoy reading and deepening your understanding of users! I never found the exercises boring and flew through them when reading them. I was worried that changing careers might be a boring or daunting task but when the content is actually mentally stimulating you enjoy spending time on the projects! It is not a short course by any means, you need to be prepared to get stuck in! It is SO worth it though. I am really happy that I have lifetime access to the contents as in my new roles I'll be able to refer back to what I have studied. At the end of the course, I came out with a really beautifully polished fantasy gaming app. I am really interested in taking the Specialization that comes for free with the program: UI for UX Designers. This means I can make my designs even more professional and aesthetically pleasing. My mentor was really really great! They had so much experience that it really helped me prepare for the industry. I took calls with them to find out about what it is like to work in the role and also they helped me get unstuck whenever I found a new technical skill challenging. I'm so grateful for all their support!",coursereport

The information is cut into manageable chunks and everything is very nice organized in the dashboard with good typography and enough space. As a visual designer, I enjoy every time I open my dashboard. Good job! It was the best online course I took so far, comparing to moodle or any other e-learning platforms Careerfoundry's learning platform is a huge step forward in many ways! I felt always supported by the Student Advisers, my Tutor, and Mentors as well as by amazing Slack community, which is a wonderful networking tool. Special thanks to my career mentor, who is always calm and up to the point during our Skype calls. At the end of the course, I have lots of materials and an online portfolio, which I am filling with the content and polishing right now for job hunting. Good luck to me! :D Pros:Support, the structure of the learning materials, the nice and easy language in the exercises, human communication, theoretical and practical know-how, online community, networking, open to any feedback.

The tutors and mentors are quick and prompt to reply and guiding. The course is much structured and really prepares you well. But, since I am from the healthcare industry I am driven by personal connection and online learning is naive to me. So, reading everything online is a little difficult for me. I was hoping to have more online videos and tutors connection so that I know what I am reading, I am understanding right and getting it right. However, assignments provide that but one lecture once a week or quick online direct lessons with video chatting could be one option. Thanks for listening to us!",coursereport

The CF did a really good job of building the whole platform. Learning materials are educative, yet never boring or hard to go through. Besides what it maters is the practical work and that counts in the real world the most. And 90% of the work is that. You are also never alone throughout the course, while there is a Student advisory team, a Tutor, a Mentor and a Community of other students always available to support and enciurage you at all times.

2081,Careerfoundry,2018-10-18,"My experience at CareerFoundry was completely positive. It's a 100% online course designed for you to be able to go at your own pace. I worked part time and was able to complete my CareerFoundry course on time. I came from a Graphic Design background, so the course came more naturally to me than most people, BUT do NOT let that discourage you from enrolling! I think it is an excellent alternative to learning design at a much more affordable price than a college course. For anyone considering taking an online course, I would reccomend it! There are 6 modules each (for UI Design course at least) with about 9 exercises you complete in each module. You also have about 6 or so calls with your tutor/mentor to help you along the way with any questions and to see where you are in the course. The job guarantee is real. You have to complete the job prep course in order to qualify, but it's totally worth it. I got hired for a job in Phoenix, AZ about 1-2 months after I graduated. I honestly didn't do anything super special. So many people say networking is the way you get a job, but I don't think that's the only way you can get hired. I just spent about 1 to 3 hours every day researching (important) and applying to jobs online that I was INTERESTED in. I did exactly what my mentor told me to do with my portfolio (important af, seriously), resume, and cover letter when applying. It paid off. I got relocation expenses completely covered, and now I'm working at the best tech company you could imagine. Do CareerFoundry, you won't regret it.",coursereport

I also wanted to do something that would allow me to be more creative in my next line of work. A week later, I saw an add for a UX Design course offered by CareerFoundry. I'd been wanting to get into the design world for some time at that point, so I took it upon myself to call CF and get all of the information. After several conversations with their career specialists, it became clear to me that UX design was the career change I'd been wanting to make for some time. I enrolled in the course and was lucky enough to receive financial support from the German government. Over the next 3 months, I put all of my energy into completing the online UX Design course. It wasn't easy, but after completing the course I now feel that I have the confidence, knowledge and skills to work in the field of UX Design. I've never been one for online courses, but the way CareerFoundry has organized their curriculum makes easy for anyone to stay motivated and on track. The lessons are thorough, well organized and feel relevant for today's job market. I always felt like I was learning things that had real value, and would be immediately applicable to the job environment. The support from their mentors is a huge help, too. Never once during the entire course did I feel like I was alone, there was always somebody there to help. They also have a Slack channel with various groups so students can communicate, share feedback and work together on projects. I really felt (and still feel) like I was part of a community, and that made for a great learning experience. Once I finished the course, I took advantage of their 'Job Prep Course', which is available to students who complete the UX Design course. For the three weeks that followed, I worked with their career specialists to refine my resume, create a portfolio and receive mentorship on things like how to network, how to search for jobs effectively, how to prepare for an interview and more... For anyone considering getting into UX Design, I would 100% recommend looking into this course.",coursereport
2083,Careerfoundry,2018-07-24,"The course is essentially one third HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery with the other two thirds being Ruby on Rails (building an E-commerce site specifically). The content is clear and well-explained and there are always links to further resources in case you want to go a step further and learn more on top of the core exercise material. I was always encouraged and motivated by my tutor whenever I handed in exercises. I didn't have much interaction with my mentor - only 3 or 4 Skype calls I think. I think he would have been available via PM if I had needed to contact him though. What sets the course apart from others is being able to interact with CF staff during and after the course, whether it be to get help with exercises or to ask for career advice. Being able to reach out to industry experts in this way is something that I've found very useful. On the otherhand, the information in the curriculum is nothing that you couldn't find online in other cheaper or free courses. That's not to say the content isn't good, just that there are a lot of great free or cheap resources out there to learn web dev at the moment. I also thought the course was a bit lacking on teh JavaScript front. There were only a handful of exercises out of the 67 total that focused on this.",coursereport
2084,Careerfoundry,2018-05-10,"I am so fortunate to have stumbled upon the CareerFoundry during my research for a career change. I studied Psychology in college and had worked in tech for some time so I wanted to make a shift into a career that would make use of my degree while being relevant in today's workforce. The coursework is extremely well curated and includes outside links to articles and videos that can help further explain the lesson. All homework tasks have a relation to a real work environment, from learning how to write an email to your team about design developments, to understanding how to approach your stakeholders, to going through all the stages of a design cycle. I always felt supported by the advisors, mentors, tutors and careerfoundry staff I was in touch with. When I had to extend the course several times due to medical issues they were extremely accomodating and comforting. I felt championed by the CareerFoundry from start to finish and even after finishing. I am grateful to them for what I learned and for providing an all star platform for me to finally make the career change I have been needing to make. Thank you CF!",coursereport
2085,Careerfoundry,2017-11-07,"I would recommend the UX design course, it gives you the basics, you get a holistic overview after the course and you'll know where and how to develop your skills afterwards. Don't expect to be an experienced top-notch designer at the end of the course, but it definitely helps in your career. I got even two job offers within a month after I finished the course but I also have to admit, that the challenges were higher at my new workplace than expected. Creating wireframes for an MVP (for a UX case study) won't necessarly prepare you for the challenges of a real app with a complex navigation. As I said, it's a great course, but be ready to make an internship in this field after you finish the course.",coursereport
2086,Careerfoundry,2017-07-20,"CareerFoundry was a decent bootcamp. The staff is great,very helpful and supportive. I just finished and still looking for job. Hoping CF will be able to place me somehwere :)). I want to say one thing here. Maybe its just me, but my experience with my tutor and mentor has not been very good. I was not getting response for questions from my mentor and only got a response when I submitted an achievement. I was told that for day to day queries I should talk to my tutor but my tutor was also very sparing in his responses. I have the option of changing mentors but I already had 3 changes as a result of mentors leaving or something else, so I decided to not ask for a change. Some of my other friends have had good experience with their mentors....soooo... Another thing is I think the curriculum could be revised to include more javaScript and small coding exercises for each lesson. I am going to meetups and I feel that there is still lots to learn (which might be the case with most bootcamps). Overall my experience was good, there is lot of support and help from slack community and for the price I paid for the course I think I got a good output. I will still keep learning more courses from careerfoundry as when u pay for one course you get lifetime access to all other courses as well so thats a terrific deal in my mind and a big selling point.",coursereport
2087,Careerfoundry,2017-04-14,The web development course at CareerFoundry is a good way to dive into the world of web programming if you are a beginner or would like to brush up on your skills after a long time of not keeping up.

2089,Careerfoundry,2016-11-30,"I signed up for the web developer course due to the more affordable cost compared to some bootcamps. I ended up leaving after one month. To the company's credit, they did offer me a full refund due to my dissatisfaction. Below are the reasons I left. -- Their curriculum is confusing and not clearly written. I understand they are a German company, but that's no excuse to have unclear, run-on sentences and poorly explained directions. I spent hours just trying to decipher what they were asking me to do. I would end up signing on to my (paid) Team Treehouse subscription and watching their video on the same subject just so I could learn it. I am not the only person who had this experience, just read the other reviews. -- My mentor hardly bothered to reply to me, and when she did, she would either only partially answer my question or just send me a link to StackOverflow. Bear in mind I had already searched stack overflow and read the same threads she sent me, on my own. I am not paying a large sum of money for somebody to google my question and send me links. In addition, she would take days to reply, often not replying at all. It got to where I didn't bother asking anything any more. So, to sum up, the curriculum was not even on par with the free courses out there. And the mentorship, which I think is most of what you're paying for, was basically nonexistent. One bright spot was my 'tutor' (who is considered more of a lower level helper I believe). He was actually wonderful and helpful, even though many times he could not answer my question and ended up googling things himself. At least he actually TRIED to help me, which I appreciate. The company asked me to reconsider leaving a negative review online because it can hurt their business. I did think about it a lot and I let a month pass by before I decided to write this. In the end, I feel others should have the opportunity to weigh my experience before spending money. I feel that the curriculum and business model at CareerFoundry needs a significant amount of adjustment before it would begin to be more effective than other online sources already available for much less money. I believe they are motivated to keep improving themselves and they have told me they are already making changes to their curriculum based on my feedback. However I cannot recommend them as of the time of this writing.",coursereport
2090,Careerfoundry,2016-11-02,"I am writing this review because I think that CF is perhaps heading in the wrong direction and needs to fix some things to be truly great. I sent this feedback to them so they know what I think, but I don't know how seriously they have taken my concerns and I think potential and new students need to know what they are getting into. I started the Web Development course in March and finished in September. The main issues I think need to be addressed: 1. The new tutor/mentor system. Incompetent and inexperienced tutors. I believe that CF may be hiring less capable tutors to cut costs (and improve their graduate statistics.) I was undertaking the course during the switchover with the new tutor/mentor system. I was unhappy with it, so was able to switch to the old system. My problem with it: my tutor was very bad. She didn't seem to know what she was doing, she gave me code with mistakes, told me to just look at the code of other students' submissions when she didn't know what was wrong with mine. She couldn't help me when I had problems and had to refer my code to my mentor to him to look at and fix. He later told me I had all these mistakes in my code (which was code my tutor had given me.) My tutor had only finished a coding bootcamp this year. She was not capable to tutor others yet she was given a tutoring position. I see now in the Slack channel that CF graduates are becoming tutors after completing the course. If you are taking this course for the tutor/mentor system, you may be very disappointed as I do not believe these tutors are experienced or knowledgable enough. I was extremely lucky that I could switch back to the old system, but all these problems wasted about a month of my time. CF really needs to get back hiring experienced and capable tutors and mentors, otherwise the quality of their graduates' work will go down. 2. I found no value in the Placement Team. I think they need to be better trained. I am not sure how well they have been trained in terms of what students are learning and what companies are looking for. I constantly see job postings in the Career Slack channel of developer jobs, but many of them are for other languages. I realise that some students may have Java experience or C++ or whatever language, but I am guessing that most students only have Ruby on Rails experience which they learned from CareerFoundry. Also, as my boyfriend is a tech recruiter for several Berlin startups, I trust his opinion and knowledge of what companies want. Some small things posted by the Placement team as advice, my boyfriend disagrees with. I was lucky to not have to rely on the Placement Team for help as they never sent me any job leads or anything like that. While my contact with them was pleasant, it was nothing of real value. For those reading this review though, do not be discouraged. While I was able to get interviews with companies thanks to my boyfriend's connections, the job I took was one I had applied to on my own. So, it can be done. I found a frontend position within two months of completing the web development course. Another thing to note: The javascript / jQuery side of this course is very light. You will need to take additional courses (even free ones like codecademy, freecodecamp) if you want to become a frontend developer.",coursereport
2091,Careerfoundry,2016-11-01,"TL:DR This course says its written for beginners, but its not. The lessons are written by something other than a human being, and you will spend a lot of time asking other students to help you understand the instructions needed to complete an assignment. This course will make you feel dumb and confused. Also, you don’t really learn much – this course consists of a lot of “copying & pasting”. You don’t really learn anything. Yeah I said it – actually I typed it. Everything in this course you can find for free somewhere else. And I promise you, it’s just a google away. Do you want to know how I know this? I spent so much of my time looking at other resources than what CF had written it it’s lesson.You learn Bootstrap, Javascript ( haha that’s a joke – you actually just copy and paste javascript- you don’t learn anything.), APIs, and Ruby on Rails (haha another joke!). 2. The Course is written by something other than a human being. One of the things that bothered me was the way things were phrased in the course. Apparently this course was written for beginners, but I beg a differ. I spend about 2-3 hours just trying to understand what CF is trying to say in a lesson than I do actually doing the work. I have to re-read things 3-4 times and it makes the work very confusing. That’s not what I paid for and it’s absolutely frustrating. 3. Mentor/ Tutor One of the things I enjoyed was the Mentor/Tutor. But I undrestand why they are needed – they are needed because students have a hard time understanding the instructions that have been written in the lessons. The tutor and mentor are the only things good about this course. The tutor I had was super helpful and the mentor really helped me understand the industry. As a current student at CareerFoundry, I have struggled imnesly. Every time I start a lesson I immediately get depressed. I think to myself – “ Here goes another 3-4 hours of wasted time”. I really wish I would have gone to a different school or spent more money. If I have to spend $10k -$20k for something that I can atleast understand – I will TAKE IT! You may be wondering why I’m still enrolled – its simple – I spent money and now I can’t get my money back unless I graduate and then wait 6 months to get a job that never comes. Only then will I get my money back. I honestly feel like I was robbed through this course. I advise anyone considering to just think long and hard about what they value most from an online school. Once you've established what you want cross CF off your list.",coursereport
2092,Careerfoundry,2016-10-23,I succeded finishing the web-development course by Careerfoundry and really enjoyed it! The 1-o-1 mentoring is very good concept for online learning courses and the project-based learning was perfect to start off as a developer! After accomplishing I could start off with my own projects right away and felt prepared enough to do so!,coursereport
2093,Careerfoundry,2016-10-18,"Having gone through the course, I wanted to leave a review for CareerFoundry, because it really helped me in the beginning reading about other people's experiences. For me, I was looking for a career change and just general direction in life when I first started looking into web development programs. For me, there were 3 important criteria that needed to addressed: - flexibility - cost - support/job assistance The biggest factor for me was flexibility – I needed to be able to go at the pace that I wanted to go, because I knew that I would have some weeks with a lot of down time and some weeks with little down time from work. I couldn’t stick to scheduled sessions and CareerFoundry was great for that because I could submit my exercises whenever and however often I wanted to. Cost was another issue – a lot of these programs were starting off in the $10,000 range and I was nervous to commit that much when I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to make it or have what it takes to do well in web development. CareerFoundry is a lot less expensive at $3,000 and was much easier to stomach. The last thing I needed to know was that what I was learning was relevant and good enough that I could find a job with it afterwards. Like most programs, CareerFoundry has a job guarantee program that really helps you prepare. The job specialists are there for one-on-one chats and were always responsive to my questions. I just started my job search, but I’m optimistic. Going through the program really helped me get started and made me realize I want to focus on front-end HTML/CSS jobs.",coursereport
2094,Careerfoundry,2016-10-03,"If you are looking for guided mentoring, this is not the course for you. Most of the time you're totally in your own and you're lucky if the tutor even looks at your code. I was sold on this mentor/tutor thing as somehow receiving extra care and help, but the reality is that you get more out of udemy and other free resources. In at least one instance, I ended up using the resources of another bootcamp to make sense of their materials. They portray this as a 15 hour/week program, but I found myself consistently putting in 30 + hours just to keep up. And this is not because the course is rigorous, but because often the lessons are poorly written. I learned more from self-study than I did from the actual course. My tutor often made feel like I should apologize for having questions; in almost every instance they were often critical of me asking anything. What a complete waste of time and money",coursereport
2095,Careerfoundry,2016-09-20,"tl;dr: spend 3 months teaching yourself with free quality materials, then spend money on a far better course This course is an absolute waste of time and even more so, money. Basically what you get here is a poorly written Bootstrap tutorial, which can be learned in about 3 or 4 hours for free. Next, the Javascript portion of the course is essentially how to copy & paste a Google Map api and some jQuery plugins into your Bootstrap site. Next, the Ruby portion is thinner than thin. You can learn more doing Firehose's free 2 week course or LaunchSchool's freebies. Next, the Rails portion is so poorly written you'll be spending more time looking at other resources than the ones you're paying CareerFoundry for. However, the worst part is the complete lack of support. I don't know how they get away with this kind of thing, -- 75% into course I really got into the weeds on the Rails section. The issue was that my alleged tutor was passing work which had problems that snowballed until my app was completely broken and had to be re-written from scratch. On top of this, I never once had direct contact with my mentor. What's the point of paying these people if they don't actually look at your code?!?!?! The main selling point of the course was mentorship, which for myself and many other students simply was not delivered. Another major red flag is the poor quality of other students' work. I was appalled at what was being passed and shown as 'approved' examples. My design & CSS skills are intermediate and people were blown away, which I found despressing. Also, it wasn't uncommon for an 'apporoved' example to have some serious mistakes. In this course, you will not be surrounded by people who will inspire you, trust me. I finished the course but I now find myself with little to no knowledge of anything siginifcant or in demand in the market place (hello Javascript!) and looking to hire my own mentor, start another bootcamp or just give up. If you're serious about learning to code and working as a dev then be aware that you do get what you pay for. In this case, you won't get much.",coursereport
2096,Careerfoundry,2016-09-16,"Mentors make or break this course, and if you get a good one, it's worth the money. Some students have had to switch mentors because feedback was very poor, or they weren't timely and involved in the student's progress. CF should restrict the number of students per mentor, so mentors are able to give adequate and timely feedback for each student and not feel overwhelmed by having too many students to deal with along with their day jobs. The course content could be much better, and sometimes there are spelling or grammar mistakes. Some lessons are not very clear or well written, and some are. CF needs to review the course material regularly and make sure it is the best it can be. More visuals, and maybe video incorporated into lessons would make it much more engaging than just written text with links to other articles on the web. CF is very open to feedback with the chance to rate and leave reviews after each lesson, and they do seem to want to improve and have made tweaks during the course. They seem to be growing and adding more staff, which is good for students and having dedicated career support is beneficial seeing as they now have a get a job guarantee. Aside from the mentor there aren't many personal touch points. You get automated emails from the 'career success team' but they lack a personal touch and feel too robotic. The only way to network with other students and share tips and resources as well as get help is the CF Slack channel. CF should really pay to upgrade the account so there isn't a cap on number of messages available. Older messages aren't shown because CF has a free account. Overall, you get what you put in. It is a starting point. You don't come away as an 'expert' and the limitations of online study, especially for the collaborative nature of UX design, leaves gaps in the knowledge/skill set when compared to in-person courses, but it's a good first step into the field and less expensive than in-person courses. If the 'get a job you love in 6 months, guarantee' works out, it's worth it.",coursereport
2097,Careerfoundry,2016-09-14,"Hi, I have really loved the material in this course. The materials and information were clear, concise, and easy to understand. Even the links to outside resources were super helpful. I read all of them even though that material was optional. But I am VERY disappointed with the course description. It stated the student would only need to spend 15 hours a week for 6 months to finish on time. I actually ended up spending more like 8 HOURS A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK, and I still did not finish on time. I am also VERY disappointed with the mentor's performance. Our communication was not great. He took 3 separate vacations during my time on the course and he only extended the length of the course by 2 short weeks. All in all I would expect that for the price of this course I would get better service (better mentorship and a more realistic timeline). Thank you, Veronica Jackman-",coursereport
2098,Careerfoundry,2016-09-10,"I did a lot of research before choosing Career Foundry. I also took the free portion of a few other online bootcamps, to get a feel for what I liked and which I would choose. In the end, I went the less expensive route and honestly feel like I wasted my money. The tutor/mentor system is a joke. I got more of a response from the guys at The Firehose Project (another bootcamp) when I did their free 2 week starter course, than I did in 4 month at CF. When you are completing a structured program and you run into things you dont understand, you need answers right away in order to continue with a full understanding. I was lucky to get a response at all from my tutor. When finally got around to checking my work, he passed things that created huge issues down the line and never should have been allowed. The few times I got him in chat to ask a question, he seemed to be clueless. My mentor (checks final projects and gives career advice in 4 spread out video calls), on the other hand, was awesome. He could see the issue Myself and many others were having with our tutors. The course work leaves much to be desired. The front end course is written very well. The back end relies on blazing through very technical situations w/o much explanataion and then tells you to get a deeper understanding by meeting with your tutor... what tutor? If I could do it over again, I would pay a bit more and go with my first instinct- Another course. In fact, I purchased the Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course(video) through Udemy just to help decipher the Career Foundry course. It was $20 and offers much more insight and explanation, and is essentially where I got my understanding from. If you are looking for one on one learning, go elsewhere. If you are looking for written direction do the Ruby on Rails Tutorial(free). There is no reason to take this course w/o the mentor experience, and that is what ended up happening. The front end course is very good. The chat rooms, while sparsley populated, are a big help. They offer a money back gaurantee if you dont find work in six months, which is awesome.",coursereport
2099,Careerfoundry,2016-09-07,"This school was such a waste of time. I feel so stupid for doing so much research beforehand. I thought I picked a really good school, but this place is awful. I am a current student in the Web Developer Course, and everyday I wish I would have picked a different school. The way these lessons are scripted is very awkward to read and hard to understand. I have spent more time trying to understand what they are trying to say, rather than doing the lessons themselves. If you ask your tutor for help, good luck. They won't get back to you for weeks, and then when they do, they seem more confused than you are. I understand that as a student it is my job to figure things out on my own, but I can't figure anything out if I don't know what I am doing. There isn't enough information to really know what you are doing. Some lessons show the answers or examples of what your code should look like, but they don't explain why, you just better know already. I DO NOT recommend this school to anybody.",coursereport
2100,Careerfoundry,2016-07-27,"The mentor makes or breaks this course. Mine was not great (not responsive, and offered little good/constructive feedback) so I felt like I was all on my own. I was about 6 weeks late finishing the course and when I did- nothing. No certificate or badge or anything. It is quite intensive but much easier at first (so do lots of assignments in the beginning as you will need more time at the end). Does it teach you UX? Yes. Is it worth the price? Probably. Especially with the $ back guarantee if you don't find a course. But there are many pitfalls: poorly designed course structure, assignments that don't parallel the lectures, etc. I highly recommend abandoning their sample project of designing a project management app and find your own project that is meaningful, that you will enjoy working on, and that you can use after the course is over.",coursereport
2101,Code institute,2024-11-12,"I recently completed the web development course at Code Institute, and overall, I found it to be a valuable learning experience. The course is divided into five sections, each beginning with a theory block that includes explanatory videos and quick coding challenges. These theory blocks are well-structured and provide a solid foundation in the respective topics.Following the theory, each section features a prebuilt codealong project, where you replicate a project step-by-step using the concepts learned in the theory block. This practical approach really helped me connect the dots and solidify understanding.The personal projects are where I learned the most. They take up a significant portion of the course. Be prepared to invest a lot of time into these personal projects (80% of the full course time). It's very important to carefully read the project requirements multiple times. Missing even a small requirement can impact your grade significantly. The theory is quite good, and there's a visible effort to keep the content up to date with modern technologies (html, css, javascript, python, jquery, django, stripe api, react and some more ...), though it's understandably difficult to have everything current at all times. The coding challenges, however, weren't always my cup of tea. They sometimes required specific answers, and minor syntax issues could cause hang-ups, which wouldn't have been an issue using an IDE, as the challenges are done completely within the browser just like with the 5-day coding challange that Code Institute makes avaliable as a taste of whats to come - though keep in mind that the course will get much more challenging compared to the 5-day challenges. A major plus of the course is the monthly hackathons hosted online. These are excellent opportunities to gain team coding experience, learn agile development, and use Git. For me, the best aspect of the course was the one-on-one help from a mentor. You have meetings three times for each project, each lasting 30 minutes. While I found this a bit short, it was incredibly helpful to get professional feedback from someone with experience. When I started the course, the lessons used to be 45 minutes which was definitely much more helpful (they got shortened while I was studying). These sessions were key in resolving issues and advancing through the course. Additionally, the course offers job search assistance through a separate mini-course that helps you create your CV, teaches you about LinkedIn, the job market, and job interviews. There are also job announcements and listings in the course's Slack channel that you can apply to if they fit your profile. There's another 30-minute one-on-one session where you review your CV with an advisor for feedback. Ultimately, you're responsible for writing applications and finding a job that works for you. While this is fair, I feel the course could provide more hands-on assistance in this field given its pricetag (i.e. multiple coaching sessions). As for the difficulty, it's hard to comment definitively as I had some prior coding knowledge. The course was challenging and required a big time commitment. I spent about 6 hours a day on it for 8 months, with 3 or 4 weekly breaks for holidays (maybe more :) who knows). It's possible to complete the course faster, but I believe the quality of my projects and what I learned would have suffered. Overall, I would recommend Code Institute's web development course to anyone looking to gain practical skills in web development. The structure, content, and emphasis on hands-on learning make it a worthwhile investment in my opinion.",coursereport

I particularly enjoyed the structured yet flexible approach, which allowed me to learn at my own pace without feeling overwhelmed. One of the program's standout features is the Careers module. It goes beyond technical skills, focusing on job readiness, CV building, interview preparation, and more. This helped me feel confident about my prospects. The team at Code Institute provides invaluable guidance throughout this process, and the result is that students graduate not only with solid coding skills but also with a polished portfolio and job-seeking strategy. The supportive community is another big plus. Whether through the Slack channels, peer support, or mentors, there’s always someone to help or provide encouragement.

Today it is essential to work with rapid prototyping languages, in cloud-oriented projects, and in much more flexible development environments. This course has provided me with the level of information and skills to tackle new projects with current tools and methodologies. Because of my availability and the complexity of the projects that CI requires, it was not easy for me to graduate, but I do not regret taking this course.",coursereport

The course material that they offer at Code Institute is absolutely fantastic, it takes and excellent curve in terms of difficulty, however it is also extremely understandable and digestible. I could not recommend this course enough!",coursereport
2107,Code institute,2024-10-02,"I have done a lot of self studying before and it felt lonely at times. Joining Code Institute made me feel so much part of a team with extreme support on each step of a journey. I have attended 2 Hackathons and each was an incredible speed up of my learnings along with presentable soft skills that are so much in demand. (eg. Teamwork, collaboration). Employees love theses skills and knowing there is so much opportunity to showcase them with Code Institute is a huge bonus. Havent seen anything like this, curriculum is changing along with the new trends ! You only learn what is really needed today! Not something you will never use again. 100% reccomend if you want to streamline your learnings.",coursereport
2108,Code institute,2024-09-30,"I completed Full Stack Web Development Diploma with specialisation in e-commerce. It takes 52 intense weeks, a lot of discipline and self learning but you learn plenty. At times it felt course structure could to be adjusted slightly and content updated (something they are doing slowly) but overall they managed to fit in a lot of knowledge in fairly short time. Support is great from peers, tutors and your own mentor too. It always depends how much work you put in yourself and this course is definitely the case. Having option to join hackathons is fantastic, it really helps getting a better feel for real life experience.",coursereport

My assigned mentor was extremely helpful, from start to finish. I really recommend using the mentor support.",coursereport
2110,Code institute,2024-09-02,"I've always had an interest in programming, though I was quite inexperienced before the diploma. Being a creative individual, I always tried to imagine what you could build using computers. My decision to finally take the plunge, was made thanks to the five day coding challenge. Enrolling in the course, I assumed it would be challenging, but for students with little or no experience in programming, the learning curve might appear steep and the material overwhealming at times. However, I never felt that I was alone on this journey, thanks to our wonderful slack community, frequent tutor support and the mentoring sessions provided by Code Institute. At times I experienced the course material to be a bit outdated and I had to work with earlier dependencies to make my projects work. However, employing a solution-focused mindset is somehing that I believe is important if you want to be a developer. Anyone looking for a serious challenge and who is willing to be teachable, will reap the rewards of being familiar with several programming languages and having built five portfolio projects at the end of the course.",coursereport

I was a complete beginner, but now after completing the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development I am ready to start taking the first steps in a new career chapter. From learning HTML, CSS and Javascript to utilising Python and the Django framework to develop a fully functional e-Commerce site, I feel the course has equipped with the fundamentals to build upon further and has given me a good sense of direction. The content delivered through the LMS was engaging, well thought out and appropriately structured to guide students through the material. Also, the student supports available are incredible, the Code Institute team really goes above and beyond to ensure students can be as successful as possible on the course. Overall, I highly recommend this course to anyone who is new to coding and wants to enhance their skillset or wants to take their first steps towards a career change!",coursereport
2113,Code institute,2024-08-03,"I had never built a web site before and was very interested in learning how. Code Institute gave me that opportunity and in one year I have achieved an L5 Diploma in Web Application Development. I won't lie, the learning scope is daunting at first as their is a lot to get through but with the planning and support available the course is easily achievable. The learning curve is steep at times but it is well structured and easy to follow. At times I lost many hours (in a good way!) working on my projects as I got so focused on what I was doing I didn't want to stop. And this was the best learning curve, getting stuck in to the projects boosted my knowledge immensely. If you have an eye for detail and a mindset of problem solving, give it a try, you might like it.",coursereport
2114,Code institute,2024-07-29,"I did the Diploma course full-time over 20 weeks. It was very intense doing it this way and left very little time to interact with others, however since handing in the final assignment I have been able to participate to a much greater extent, and wow it has made a difference. When I started I noticed a huge rework of the course work happening, and I got stuck once or twice because the section was removed or reworked. But on the whole, it didn't cause me too many issues. Interacting with tutors/mentors/student care is very easy and I appreciate the ability to be able to change mentors if needed. Given the increase in AI integration generally, the slight change in focus seems to be sensible, embracing it not fighting it. It is on the expensive side, BUT getting an actual accreditation from a real University is a massive benefit, and I think with the careers support included it is well worth the price.",coursereport
2115,Code institute,2024-07-22,"I just recently received my degree in ""Software Development (E-commerce Applications)"" from Code Institute. And through the curriculum I would ay for the most part is structured very well in some cases you will find your self seeking the answers online or through your network. Not Ideal a bad thing but it is note worthy. Was it worth the money spent I mean its not the cheapest course out there I was looking for an academically accredited course my self and the structure I needed to be successful. It was a great challenge for some one who's always been classed as a slow learner in academics to put my hobby into real skills. I didn't utilize many of the benefits during the course ie tutors or mentors. Sadly my main mentor had to leave when he joined the US Army in a new exciting role. I could have reached out for a new mentor although working as much as I do it was not really something I had the time for. I had a solid grasp of the course the whole way through. This is very hustle and bustle if your doing other things on the side such as working full time or part time. The overall courses were very well presented but as mentioned above there will be times you need to do some external research whether through the web or slack. Its bound to happen. Curriculum is great overall personally speaking I feel students should continue to have access to the course after completion as this is online and the overhead should be fairly minimal at worst. Maybe even if its only a year or so after just so they can go back and refresh on some stuff if they wanted to not that there aren't other sources of information. As for the Job Assistance its there pretty standard stuff such as CV, Cover letter, and Linkedin support in making yourself stand out. They tend to have ins to recruiting circles and can get the scoop prior to a company posting a role. You wont out right get a position just by completing the course you need to take action yourself to make this happen they will support you as much as they can in the process. Final thoughts: Was it worth the price tag? To an extent I would say yes if structure and having a university accredited diploma is what your looking for. Overall I think I enjoyed it even knowing I can get the same knowledge else where cheaper or even free. I wanted structure and deadlines as it makes me work better. I also wish Code Institute could partner with companies and move graduates possibly into internships or Junior roles with companies directly just a nice help boost. I also understand that Code Institute is not a recruitment agency but it would add tremendous value to the course.",coursereport
2116,Code institute,2024-07-18,"At the time of enrollment, the content was extremely outdated (no Flexbox or grid for HTML/CSS, the libraries used for the Advanced Front End project were from 3 years ago, the authentication method is not aligned with the HTTP standard -and nobody was able to explain to me how it works because the tutorial is just a code along with no real explanation of this-, and the Django tutorial was disappointing, to the point that even using the same project, the course was recently changed 100%). When I approached tutoring, they were not able to help me most of the time, because they follow the templates on the tutorials, therefore, if the student tries to use the updated version of the libraries/frameworks, or even come up with something new for her/his project, they are not able to help you. Probably it was a matter of bad luck, that I got into the course right before the content was updated, but paying the same amount of money as the student enrolling 3 months after me and getting better content was frustrating. On the other hand, if the student has doubts about the content, or technologies, or wants to go deeper into a topic, there is no one to help you. In the end, there is almost nothing more than the content and being able to use the community on Slack (which IMHO is not worth thousands of Euros). If you decide to enroll, I would advise you to stick to the tutorials as much as possible when creating the projects. Change one or two things to have a pass, and create an awesome README for merit. If you would like to probably have distinction (because the criteria are unclear), try coming up with something new but simple, and write an immaculate code. If you need a diploma, Code Institute is a good option. But if not, I would recommend buying Udemy courses (which are not more than €18… never pay the higher amount, there are discount codes all over the internet, just Google it). There is no other advantage. Also, most of the Udemy courses are updated as soon as there is a new version of the frameworks (speaking about the Django, Javascript, and React courses I needed to buy to complete the course) and, if you have doubts, most of the courses will give you access to a Discord server where, sometimes, even the creator of the course answers questions, no matter if they are part of the content or not. That would more or less compensate for tutoring and the Slack channel. NOTES: 1. It seems like CI is going through a change in almost everything. But, my experience was not good. I hope they manage to sort everything out, which is a lot. 2. Student Care and the facilitators (at least the one I had) are extremely supportive. Still, the internal politics seem to have them hands-tied in helping you have a better learning experience.",coursereport

I started learning web development some years ago, but I never worked professionally with it. So, I decided to take the Code Institute ""Free 5 Day Coding Challenge"" first and then I got accepted to the Code Institute ""Diploma in Software Development (e-Commerce Applications)"" course via Springboard. From my experience and after completing the course, I can say the following. The content of this course is great. It is suitable for both those who have no previous programming experience and those who have programming experience and just want to learn more about web development, like me. Of course, as it is an online platform, the student must adapt to it and accept that the course is prepared to reach a large number of people. You should not assume the course will be tailor-made for you. The Code Institute team is great, supporting anything you ask, as long as you follow the rules. You just need to take your learning experience seriously and get in touch immediately whenever you have any difficulties. The rules are pretty clear. You must read and follow them, respecting the deadlines and contacting the Code Institute to temporarily block your access and postpone your deadlines, if there is any personal or professional situation preventing you from studying and progressing in the course, so that you have time to successfully complete the course after this situation is resolved. My learning experience with Code Institute was very pleasant. I look forward to applying what I learned and continuing to learn.",coursereport
2119,Code institute,2022-09-22,"My review is for the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development (E-commerce Applications). I found the course to be interesting and to cover quite a lot of useful topics, particularly for someone like myself who is quite new to software development. There were plenty of challenging moments but overall I found it to be a worthwhile experience. Over the course of the diploma, you create 5 portfolio projects that range from HTML and CSS right up to a full-stack e-commerce application built in Django using technologies like Bootstrap, jQuery, Stripe for payments, AWS S3 for file storage and more. The course structure leads you from the more straightforward concepts like HTML and CSS, on through JavaScript, Python and then onto full stack development. There was plenty of support available to help students, in the form of the Student Care team, the Slack community, tutors and a mentor. There is also the Careers team who have plenty of tips and useful advice, such as help with your CV, LinkedIn profile, cover letters and more, as well as posting regular job alerts on the Slack. The part of the course I didn't really enjoy was the Design Thinking module, as it felt a bit vague and would've been better with proper scenarios; I may have enjoyed it more if that were the case. Equally, I don't really plan to get into design so this may be why I didn't really engage with it. However, I found the rest of the content to be really interesting and feel like I learned some very useful skills, which I hope to be soon applying in a new role.",coursereport

When I see what I have learned within a year and what help I have had with it, I am very happy that I did this.",coursereport
2121,Code institute,2022-04-30,"The short answer is the course is a full stack program, but it's absolutely not worth the money. I completed approx 70% of the learning material and submitted 3 projects before deciding that the Code Institute boot camp was a waste of time. Online boot camps have a lot of cheaper alternatives to contend with and that can present a problem for boot camps, who must have something special to bring them beyond someone seeking cheaper alternatives. Right from the get go, the Code Institute has issues, it's HTML course is weak, doesn't cover some basic aspects of website design and has a challenge system that is too restrictively coded at times, so that correct code submissions come back with errors. Hints are generally not helpful, and time can be wasted trying to find errors in your code where it turns out they were looking for an rgba input even thought the instructions were to put in an rgb. Often here the issue is less with the coding but more with understanding what they want you do. It doesn't help that the course is often reams of text with a challenge on another page, meaning if you want to check something, you need to either dance between webpages or have multiple tabs open, which can throw off their progress system. Sure these are minor issues, but also they're generally unique to Code Institute. My overall experience of going through the HTML section was it was beyond lackluster, I opted to supplement my learning with another course. I found this second non Code Institute course to be vastly superior in all metrics, more complete content, better presentation, more coding challenges, better coding challenges, clearer instruction. These issues just pile up the more you go through the course. One of the more egregious issues runs with parts of the course that are out of date. More often than not there's just a quick note attached to the top of a video to ignore a chunk of it and do something else, or the video starts with setting up a legacy coding environment Code Institute no longer uses. Some of these videos are pushing 2 years, so this patchwork of fixes becomes the norm. Again generally looking at other coding courses I've conducted, and no other course is so out of date. The coding projects aren't particularly inspiring either, rather than provide any real instruction, it's a more free from 'do something'. Issues with really stem from a lack of clear understanding of what is required for submission. Code Institute don't present examples of pass/merit/distinction of projects and the mark scheme is vague and uninformative. It didn't help that my mentor wasn't available for 2 of the 3 projects I submitted, and was only available for the last night of the other one. The overall feeling I got was to not be adventurous or push yourself, just do a simple and safe project, which I feel is a terrible way of assessing potential. Feedback from the project submissions is similarly vague and often questionable, but ultimately unhelpful. As someone who has teaching and mentoring experience as a postdoc, the feedback is just lazy. This should be a real strength of a bootcamp but with the Code Institute, it's just another missed opportunity turned into a weakness. I really wanted to use the Code Institute as the core for my learning experience and entry into coding, I was drawn into the rather nicely setup and laid out 5 day coding challenge, which is a good experience. However I came away from every module with a deep dissatisfaction in the learning outcomes. More and more I found myself going to other courses to learn material that should be covered in sufficient depth in the Code Institute subject matter. Outside the learning objectives, there is a friendly Slack environment, but this is mainly students, and I am a member of a number of similar communities. Still it's not bad. I didn't find the career crunches helpful, this may be because I've come from a professional background and have been involved in recruitment before, but they were very basic, and ultimately not helpful. They're not at a great time for people doing the course with a standard day job either. I can't see any justification to using the Code Institute in its current form. There are far superior examples of learning objectives online, and I don't think any of the strengths of a boot camp really come up here. The fundamental issue is that the curriculum is muddled, out of date, and presented in a unique, but unhelpful fashion. Not enough care has been put into the construction and the over-reliance on proprietary systems frustrates more than supports. There are many better systems out there to learn how to code, Code Institute could get there, but it would need a large overhaul, most of the course videos need to be updated/reshot, the learning objectives need to be thrashed out, and the courses need to be bulked. More complex coding challenges, and more implementation to real world situations. As it stands there is a long way to go before the course could be recommended, even if it was free.",coursereport

The theme was ""Building an Accessible Workplace"" and the event was kicked-off with a very insightful SODA Social panel discussion webinar, with panelists from Ecosia, HER, Mildon & Google. I was very lucky to have such wonderful teammates who all invested a huge amount of time and effort into this fascinating topic and it was a great experience of working in an agile development environment. Our team used our Full-Stack knowledge to create a modular plug-in app that simplifies the recruitment and hiring process and has user accessibility at its core. Our Tech Stack for this project included: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, Javascript, emailJS, Heroku, MongoDB, Python & Flask. We used Github's project board to breakdown all the required tasks into bite size sprints and we also utilised Github Wiki pages to organise our research & planning notes. Naturally we also used Github for our version control, with each team member forking off my main repository, working on branches within their fork and then creating Pull Requests to be reviewed and approved by the team before merging back onto the main repository. It was an amazing learning experience with a fantastic team of developers, on a topic with such a wide scope. I'm really looking forward to the next Code Institute Hackathon as they are a wonderful way to put your newly acquired skills into practice, a great opportunity to learn from your peers and while they can be intense you do come away from them with a great sense of achievement.",coursereport

Having zero knowledge of what a hackathon was, let alone limited coding experience, my gung-ho attitude of ""let's do this"" had me sign up. Initially I thought I had bitten off far more than I could chew, but the teams were balanced with juniors and seniors, and even though my current (hospitality) job seems to demand more time than I have in the day, I quickly found myself with a group of fun, open minded and helpful peers. I had a great time with the recent Hackathon and the team were really amazing. I did at times feel like a bit of a 5th wheel due to my inexperience and lack of aptitude, but was still able to contribute creatively and it gave me the opportunity to play around with the wireframes, which is something I hadn't done before. We utilized Kaboom, which I found at a base level, very intuitive. Overall, I got to experience what I can imagine it must be like working in a live dev team, with a real world problem to a real world deadline/crunch, which I think more than anything is invaluable ,especially at the start of the course.

Eventhough I had zero experience in programming I was always interested in software development and after a conservation with a friend I started to research online courses which finally led me to this course. After talking to the representative I decided to enroll and and was given an initial trial period since I was worried that the online learning would not be adapted for me. Once I started I was really impressed with the course content and how professional the online learning platform worked. The course is well adapted to people like myself, with no programming experience, to obtain a solid programming foundation. The learning curve is quite steep at times and does require additonal research which is a must for any programmer. The course providers are great and kept in regular contact with me to check on how the course was going. The course content is well designed with 4 milestone projects which are well paced and supported with great tutorials. As I progressed through the course I found myself more confident in programming. I did however find myself stuck at certain times during the course and had to use one of the support sytems. I cannot praise the support system enough. The system works extremely well and whenever I queried them for some clarification on course content or programming issues I always got prompt help to guide me through my problems. I do encourage students to get well acquainted with the support system sooner rather than latter since you definately progress more smoothly through the course.

I had an overwhelmingly positive experience overall, the course is definitely challenging and is no way an easy option. As I had no prior knowledge of coding I still had to put in a decent amount of personal research and effort. However the student support that was available I found to be the most beneficial aspect, as the tutor team would always respond to any issues that I came across and would never leave a question unsolved, making sure that I was able to move forward to the next stage. In addition the video tutorials and tasks are clear and informative that provide you the knowledge and skills to complete the Milestone Projects. The projects themselves build up your confidence at a sensible pace to enable you to reach the point of being a fully competent Web Developer at the end of the course. You also provided with a personal mentor who would also assist you with the Milestone projects. Even though the mentors were really helpful and supportive it was unfortunate that my first mentor left half way through and some of the continuity was lost. During my time studying I faced some personal health issues that slowed my progress through the course, but the Code Institute were totally understanding and with me providing sufficient documentation to prove my situation, I was given the necessary extension to complete the course.

The online course started off well with the HTML, CSS modules but then JavaScript and Python modules were intensely complicated, covering a lot of concepts and the majority of the time I was left to research and google on my own to understand what was being taught, tutor support is available but i would have to wait on average 45 - 120 mins for each question and that is not a guarantee they could help as some of them are also recent graduates of the course. I've had many times the tutor's shift ended and they abruptly tell me that and I would have to wait for another tutor to help, they often made me feel stupid and had an arrogant and obnoxious attitude, although there were a few good humble tutors too. Mentor support is for when you do the milestone projects you get 30 - 60 mins each time and you are given technical advice and how to proceed with the project. I didn't really resonate with my mentor but was discouraged to change as I had already started with him. He was telling me that coding was basically fixing coding problems, so you would spend most of your time googling and researching on the internet finding the answers and even when you've been working as a developer for so many years you still don't know that much. Project assessments are a bit random as the feedback tells you to test or code another way that was not taught on the course, which is really strange and puts you up to fail. My overall experience is that they just want your money and the support is sorely lacking for something so complicated. This course is adequate if you already know a lot or have developer friends to help you out and you have lots and lots of time to research. Also if you don't mind getting frustrated frequently because you don't know what you're doing and you have to figure it out yourself.",coursereport
2136,Code institute,2021-02-23,"I started the course on the 29th of November day after my 21st birthday. I did not have any knowledge of coding. I was looking to learn. For Code Insitute, I found out by looking up all of the schools available in Europe. I have familiars who have finished coding schools but have not learned anything. I did not want the same to happen to me as I knew I wanted to do something serious. After reading information on Code Institute's website, the first thing that I noticed was that their degree is university-approved. After I have started the course everything that they were claiming on the website came to be true. I could not be more satisfied with my CI diploma as even recruiters have told me that now I have a strong profile to be a junior developer. So CI diploma can get you a job, it is a well-respected institution even by people who did not know about it before. The amount of knowledge you gain from completing the course will give you the best starting point for your career in this industry. That is why I highly recommend CI.",coursereport
2137,Code institute,2021-01-20,"Starting with the 5-day coding challenge I was compelled to continue and apply for the Full Stack Developer course part time because I have another fulltime job. I entered the course in September 2019 and finished in December 2020. The situation is I want to leave my current work for a new career and I hope this will be able to do that. The 5-day coding challenge is a good introduction to the actual course structure, with different modules laid out on different days as a sort of schedule. Coming from a background with no knowledge of code the course is gentle in the beginning with about 1/4 of the total course working with HTML, CSS and a little Bootstrap. Then it leads on to Javascript and jQuery in the Interactive Frontend module, a particularly bumpy step for many students, this is a common thread in the Slack community but thankfully help can be gained from tutor or mentor support, even other students depending on particulars. After half the course is done you start reading the Data Centric Module which is all about using Python and Flask with noSQL backend using mongoDB, combined with some Javascript for nice frontend features. At this point the Javascript starts to make more sense. The last module is Full Stack Frameworks with Django which is another Python framework where you will learn database modelling in SQL, and tie several api services together such as AWS, SQL, Heroku and Stripe to produce an impressive homemade project. In each of the 4 modules you are required to produce a web app which will be examined by Code Institute, and you will be getting some impressive feedback with scores for different aspects and some interesting feedback. Since you will be doing several practice projects throughout the course you are not allowed to plagiarize but some boilerplate code or particular components can be borrowed as long as you declare it in the Readme. Readme documentation is something important and the Markup language is discussed as well. These projects will be scored and the average of these determines your final score. For my final project I had to extend submission by 2 months (in 1 month increments) which was fine by Student Care, and these extensions do not affect your score. On my part time schedule I mostly had to put in 1 or 2 hours per day, I could skip a day and work it up in the weekends at times, but if I lagged behind I could always call in to the Student Care team who were always very relaxed with requests of extension. Last but not least the price tag is indeed a treshold, but I think it's a comparably good price for the available support, they keep calling to check up on you, and there is also one-on-one tutor support available, mentor sessions for the examina projects and helpful staff available in the Slack Channel as well as other students who were sometimes able to help me. Even though the Student Care is not about learning I have to mention that there are some gentle souls working there who are always nice to talk to. I am currently in the ""Careers"" module which is a nice addition since many of the students are looking for career changes. They have webinars with invited tech companies and experts willing to look over your documentation and do a mock interview, and it's all there for your help. So in final words, I would rate the course at 5/5 even though it's a bumpy ride entering functional programming, but it's because of the nature of backend programming. I would recommend the course for anyone, if you can manage the 5-day coding challenge.",coursereport
2138,Code institute,2020-12-01,"Back in January 2019, I stumbled upon Code Institute's 5-day coding challenge and thought why not? I was heavily into the idea of C++ game development at the time and was pursuing that. But coding and programming was really what I wanted to do, and I didn't much mind what I was creating; creation itself and the method of doing so was what inspired me. The coding challenge was a lot of fun and honestly a nice and, importantly, accurate preview on the flow of the instruction and using the LMS. I was hooked. Fast forward boring financial stuff. Days later, I was chatting to Student Care (great team, by the way - they come back later in the story), about what my goals were and setting out a plan with me. Very supportive and genuine. I felt their duty of care immediately. So, I basically got stuck into the first module. I won't go into too much detail here about each module or the content within it. I will, however, say that you'll learn the fundamentals of programming (not language specific), which will stay with you. More on this later (unless you've already rolled your eyes at my cumbersome review and haven't made it this far. That's OK. To those staying with me, I thank you. At least you'll know this is a real review. I mean, who would invest this much time writing a fake one? Seems silly. But I digress!). Working full-time and studying part-time around a family, which included wife, 3-year-old son, and an infant daughter, was no easy feat. It was taxing, to say the least. And the dreadful Tax Man took up Father Time's job for the duration of the course. Mind you, Father Time just does his job and gets on with it. We don't like it but it is what it is. The Tax Man was stealing time from me. Once again, I digress. My full schedule meant that I was unable to stay within the confines of the initial course deadline (not making excuses here, I was just not that great at juggling busy home and professional life with study life). But fear not, dear student, Student Care to the rescue! After a very convenient email exchange... voila, time extended and stress levels returned to... well, still high but certainly not looming-deadline-and-large-amount-of-work-still-to-do high! All throughout the course, I made good use of every avenue that could lead me to a solution to a problem I may have been facing. And, thankfully, Code Institute offers a good amount of them. From Slack, to Tutors, to a Mentor, you’re never far from someone offering to help you (heck, I still scan Slack in the hopes that someone has asked a question, only to be disappointed that someone else got there before me. They’re too fast on there! Or perhaps I “slack” off too much. Sorry, it was right there. I shall sign off this novella with a good luck to anyone either already taking this course or considering it. As the title says, it’s well worth the journey and I have successfully changed careers a mere couple of months after receiving my diploma. The tech stack I’ll be using isn’t what I learned with Code Institute, but do you recall a few chapters ago when I mentioned learning non-language-specific fundamentals? Well, what I learned from Code Institute inspired confidence in my future employer, who were certain I’d be able to pick up their stack in my stride. And you know what? They were 100% on that.",coursereport

But most importantly, I had a great mentor who encouraged me to manage my milestone projects by breaking down all the tasks, guided me to the right resources and gave solid and concrete feedback which helped me to achieve great scores! Now, as I am looking for a job, the careers team are also helping me and providing super rich webinars along with tech companies.

Not so much student care when they just repeat same message and not listening, no student caring at all. They really don't care about you, they will press you, hunt you like crazy for the money. This is a band of burglars salesman rather than a institute or school. You can use their slack, support, or your mentor, but everything is so slow, takes days at worse for a response, yeah sure, time difference, but I'm a student, I need to be taken cared of and not abbadoned in the code jungle. They don't pay attention to your private life or any thing that could happen. You can get an extension if you're near death for free at best, otherwise pay up for the whole course sum again.

2142,Code institute,2020-07-26,"Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development is a full-stack web development bootcamp, which you can take full-time (4 months) or part-time (up to 14 months). Although I was unemployed at the time, I eventually chose the part-time option as I didn't want to commit to a full 8-hour-a-day obligation. It eventually took me just over 7 months to complete the course, precisely the time I set myself in the beginning. TL;DR: my experience with the course, the topics covered, the support offered, the student community, and with Code Institute in general, has been overwhelmingly positive. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in web development, with only one caveat: if you're a complete novice to the computer world, don't quite know the difference between Windows, Word and Explorer yet, or have never used the word ""variable"", then you might find yourself struggling with certain course topics. Intro Code Institute (CI) has a nice ""demo course"" for aspiring applicants, called the 5-Day Coding Challenge. It is designed to give the prospective applicant a taste of the coding world, of the teaching approach the full course takes, and an opportunity for the person to ascertain whether their aptitude and interests are really aligned with what the course has to offer. I ran into the challenge by fortune (or by search engine wizardry? :)) and completed it just to see what it was all about. I enjoyed it, it was fun and interesting, but as I hadn't made a serious decision to change careers at that particular time yet (I had worked in the aviation industry for 18 years prior), I didn't give it much thought when I finished it. Pre-course A couple of months later - and by then I was already seriously contemplating leaving my then-current job and changing careers - I was contacted by CI's Educational Advisor and asked if I'd be interested in taking the course. Our first conversation (over the phone) lasted for over half an hour, during which he explained to me the types of support offered during the course, the financing options, and addressed all questions I had. It was not one of those generic phone sales calls where the person just reads a written advertisement in robot-like voice spouting their perfect product - it was an open and honest personal conversation involving many questions from my part, and at no time did I have the feeling that he was just trying to sell me his product. What really “sold” me for the course – even in comparison with other similar courses I had looked at – were these promises: - a university-credited diploma upon successful completion of the course, - a curriculum built upon technologies in high demand by the industry, - four-pillar in-course support (Student Care, Tutors, personal Mentor, Slack community) - career support upon course completion. Price The price of EUR 5500 (I think it's slightly higher now) was not negligible by any stretch, but once I had made the final decision to change careers, and comparing the above promises to other courses of similar content/scope and their prices, it was more than reasonable. So I quit my job, and decided to jump in head-first. And I never looked back. Start On the first day of the official course start (new part-time students officially start on Tuesday) I received a personalised welcome call from Student Care, followed by an email containing a bundle of useful student brochures (welcome pack, Student Charter, support guide), and a personalised course schedule based on the time I had said I'd like to complete the course in. The schedule is very useful for tracking one's progress as it tells you exactly what lesson you should be at on which date, thus helping you plan your studying and preventing you from falling behind on the schedule. Really helpful. Contents The courses Learning Management System is an online application enabling access to all the course materials, plus links to Tutor Support and Slack (although Slack definitely works better when downloaded as a standalone desktop app). The course contents are divided into modules of two general types: - ""Fundamentals"" modules - teaching the syntax of the particular language covered (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python), - ""Practical"" modules - providing practical application of the theoretical concepts learned in the Fundamentals. Thus the HTML and CSS modules are followed by a User-Centric Frontend module (introducing Bootstrap), JS is followed by an Interactive Frontend module (introducing jQuery), and Python is followed by Practical Python (introducing Flask), Data-Centric Development (introducing SQL and MongoDB), and Full-Stack Frameworks (introducing Django). As a general rule, the Fundamentals modules are a mix of text lessons, runnable examples and auto-graded challenges or quizzes, while the Practical modules are video/tutorial-based (with occasional challenges) and involve theory (e.g. UI/UX design concepts or database design) and code-along mini projects. I found most of these lessons very intuitive and easy to follow; some challenges were really challenging and there are some individual points that perhaps could be explained more clearly (although that is really completely subjective), but I can honestly say that I never encountered any issue that I wasn't eventually able to resolve with some own research or, when that failed, using one of the available support options. What bears pointing out is that at the end of every module (be it Fundamentals or Practical) there is a Student Feedback Form which enables every student to leave feedback on the module they just completed. Student feedback is clearly important to CI, and the course is undergoing constant improvements - just as an example, around the time I started, they changed the “official” course IDE to replace an outdated one, and around the time I was finishing, the Django module was fully remade to use Django 3, and is IMHO currently the best module in the course. Minor bugs or problems (which can also be reported through Slack) are usually resolved (or at least worked around) within hours or days at most. A single weak point (but again, this is a completely personal opinion) I was able to identify in the course, is the transition from JavaScript fundamentals to practice. While the JS Fundamentals module is really solid, and the Practical part covers some essential topics like API handling quite well, what I felt was lacking was a code-along project that would build a working JS app from scratch, a demonstration how to apply all the little pieces of the puzzle that are JS syntax and put them together into a working app. The feeling I had was that of a person holding a large set of Lego bricks and knowing exactly what each one does separately, but having no idea how to put them together. By its very nature, JS is a significant difficulty increase from HTML/CSS, and I found myself really struggling to put my theoretical JS knowledge to practice, as did a significant number of other students I conversed with. This is the single point I think really should be improved in the course, and I wrote that in my Feedback Form. Projects Every major Practical module ends with a Milestone Project, which has clear official requirements and is graded by an external expert. Thus at the end of the course the graduate has a portfolio of four major apps (HTML/CSS, HTML/CSS/JS, Flask/MongoDB, Django/SQL) that they can demonstrate their knowledge and skills with. The value of the Milestone Project work is immense - one learns to use a real IDE (Gitpod is the official one for the course, but the student is free to choose any alternative IDE if they want to, albeit with limited support), to use Git and GitHub, to search for solutions online (one learns that ""Google is your best friend"" is so much more than just a catchphrase), to use online tools (validators etc.) and resources (Stack Overflow and beyond) and, most important of all, one sees the result of their theoretical knowledge being materialised into something working and usable. Priceless. Support The ""four pillars"" of support, as advertised, are: Student Care A service for general student matters (LMS access, mentor assignment, progress tracking etc.). But the level of care they demonstrated (at least to me) far exceeded my expectations. Every six weeks or so I would receive a phone call asking me how I was, acknowledging my progress, my good use of Tutor Support and Slack activity, asking if I was ready for my Milestone Project and/or if I had any difficulties. When my hometown was struck by an earthquake in March 2020, they even called me to ask if there was anything they could help me with - may seem like just a nice gesture, but to me, that's more student care than what I received during my polytechnic studies. Tutor Support A chat-based instant support for day-to-day course-related issues. Primarily intended for lesson clarifications or help with challenges, they will also never refuse to answer even project-related or debugging issues. I only contacted them five or six times during the entire course, three of those times in relation to my Milestone Project, and only when I was really really stuck, but every single time they came through incredibly and helped me resolve my issue or at least pointed me in the right direction. One time the lady Tutor even set up a one-to-one screen-sharing live call to help me debug my code using Dev Tools. The best part? Tutor Support is available 24h on weekdays and 9-17h on weekends. It doesn't really get much better than that. Mentor Each student is assigned a personal mentor, a professional programmer whose primary purpose is to guide the student through their milestone projects. Three half-hour sessions per project are foreseen, and the mentor is there not so much to help with coding issues, but to provide ideas on code improvements, suggestions on best practices, advice on app features etc. Apparently some mentors get more involved, some less, but I'd say that how much you get from your mentor is mostly up to you - I for example have a feeling now that perhaps I could have gotten much more had I asked, but at the time I was too busy just getting my apps to work and submitting my projects on time. Slack Current students, alumni, some of the mentors, and some of the CI staff (mostly Tutors and the Community Manager) are what makes up the CI Slack Community. Each course module has a dedicated channel where students can ask questions about specific course-related issues they encounter, and what is so invaluable is that they will often get not only peer-level answers (e.g. from a ""senior"" student who had struggled with the same challenge before them) but also expert-level clarifications from alumni and/or mentors who already work as professional programmers. Some mentors and alumni go so far to occasionally host live educational calls they see students struggle with, and these calls are an immense additional learning opportunity. I can say without a shred of doubt that the Slack community is the most valuable non-coding part of the course. The amount of support, friendliness and positivity in the channels is incredible, and I have made some really good friends there even though I have never met any of those people before. Career support I must say I was the most skeptical about this part. Yes, there is a Careers module at the very end of the course, with some really useful contents (what a CV should look like, why a LinkedIn profile is important, how to write a good cover letter). Also, many third-party vacancies are regularly posted in Slack, and also CI cooperates with several renowned companies who look for developers. But as a career-changer I really felt I would need more ""personalised"" assistance as I had never attempted a job hunt before, much less in the programming market. I was afraid the module and the job posts alone would be woefully insufficient. All my fears were alleviated in my first Google Meet call with the Career Support lady. Not only did she help me remake my CV and advised me what to change in my LinkedIn profile on the spot, she also gave me ""homework"" (with instructions how to do it) to look for prospective employers/vacancies and make a list. In the next call, we reviewed the list and she told me to start applying from the bottom of the list while she would start contacting the HR/recruiting departments in the companies, with the aim of introducing me so I would not be just another anonymous application. We continued through email correspondence, where she provided me with more very valuable advice e.g. on how to respond to application rejections. In the first three weeks of a serious job hunt, I managed to land three interviews. And while I haven't received any job offers yet (it's been only four weeks now, and it's vacation season), I feel that the career support I have received so far has been nothing short of stellar. Course difficulty You will hear some people complain that there is too much self-study and outside research required, that for the attached price tag you shouldn’t need to do that. I disagree. Yes, some individual research is needed. But I say with full confidence that there is no obstacle that the course puts in front of the student that couldn’t be overcome using own efforts, Google + outside resources, , Tutor Support, and Slack – at least I haven’t encountered one. And I really appreciate the moments when I was forced to do some own “digging”, as these have taught me the invaluable skill of looking for solutions, asking questions and Googling properly – I know that all this sounds like a joke, but if you’ve ever talked to a programmer, you’ll know it isn’t. I’m glad I wasn’t handed all the answers on a silver platter – I truly believe it has made me a better future programmer. It has also helped me overcome some personal insecurities, which is also a point not to be thrown away. There will also be people who feel that they are struggling too much, that the lessons are too difficult or too unclear and that the amount of support available is insufficient. While I can appreciate the sentiment - I had my struggles during the course, especially with JavaScript as mentioned above, and there will be the odd lesson that could have been worded better - I have to disagree again. As a former Air Traffic Controller, I can provide this parallel: while probably almost anyone could be taught to eventually work as an Air Traffic Controller, the time required to achieve that, and the quality of one's work afterwards, would vary wildly from person to person. But the bar has to be set somewhere. We all have our strengths and weaknesses, and I don't think it's fair to expect the bar to be set at the level of our weakness. Personally, I have zero talent for visual arts. Could I then blame a painting course for failing to make a Picasso out of me? Conclusion What I feel I have received from the course: - solid grasp of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, Django, MongoDB and SQL, and the corresponding documentation, - familiarity with Bootstrap, Materialize and jQuery, - ability to plan, design and execute a web project from start to finish, - ability to troubleshoot, debug and fix my code, - solid knowledge of code versioning, - ability to use a professional-level IDE, and the ability to grasp any alternate one in the future, - ability to ask good troubleshooting questions, - ability to search online resources quickly for solutions and/or clarifications, - ability to help others resolve their code issues. - immense support on all levels, from coding assistance to career to community/friendship. All said and done: worth every cent and every minute invested.",coursereport

2149,Code institute,2020-05-01,"I found this to be a fantastic course and an excellent challenging experience. Coming from a sales background with little to no knoweldge of coding I found it significantly challenging. Luckily the support that is offered reallys helps you and it does it in a way that lets you find the answer yourself without just providing it straight up. The support tools include a mentor assigned to you for the whole duration, who was excellent, basically a 24/7 tutoring team, who were also excellent, an awesome slack community that includes students going through the same course with channels specific to the stage you are at and a general student care team who check in with you regularly to ensure everything is ok and on track. And again everyone who I dealt with whether it was student or staff couldnt be more helpful. Dont get me wrong there are times when my head was completely melted from trying to grasp the concepts, and as you dig deeper you realise that there is so much to learn and it can sometimes be overwhelming, but if you stick at it and leverage the help at hand then you can do well. Dont underestimate the time you need to set aside too, the course assessment is based on four milestone projects that are designed to implement your learnings along the way and get progressively more advanced as each new concept is integrated, with the culmination reaching a project needing the full stack suite of skills and tools to complete successfully. Now freshly finished I do feel like I have come along way, however, I would say that whilst I have a broad new skillset, I do have the desire to practise practise practise to become much more proficient and polished in each new skill I have, to get to the standard that I am pursuing, but that might be just my personality. The fact I could only study part time (about 15-20hrs per week) might also mean feel I need to do more in my own time now. You could easily give this course 40 hours plus per week with all the areas that it covers if you have the time and the desire to go deeper into it. Overall, I highly recommend it and it does get you job ready if you are accountable and disciplined.

I don't regret it at all, though, because the industry-ready projects I made allowed me to get a job before I was even finished. I successfully transitioned from a career in marketing to one in software development thanks to the course. I now hold a position as a frontend developer at a nice company (established, mid-sized, higher salary than I ever made in marketing), so for me it has been absolutely worth it! The course gives you a portfolio with which you are ready to apply for junior positions and gives support along the way. I never felt alone because even though it's all online you get regular checkups, a lively Slack community, online tutors available 24/7 to help with questions and debugging, and a dedicated mentor to help you with your projects. My mentor was a Google engineer who helped me out tons and went above and beyond to make sure I succeeded. In general, I'm still of the opinion that it's entirely possible to get good enough at development to get a job entirely for free with the many free resources available on the internet. But, for people like me, who struggle without structure, direction, social contact and deadlines, it's absolutely worth it to invest in a course like Code Institute to get additional support in this transition. I never felt left alone, and the team at Code Institute was always there to help.",coursereport
2154,Code institute,2020-04-15,"I recently just finished the Full Stack Web Development course with Code Institute. They were absolutely brilliant. I cannot say enough good things about them -- their student care advisors and tutors in particular -- incredibly responsive and helpful. The course material was at a very good level and covers a lot. I went in having a fair bit of knowledge already, but came out knowing so much more. They were also very patient with me as I struggled for a bit to find time to work through the course and milestone projects. A huge shout out to Neil Kavanagh for working with me.",coursereport
2155,Code institute,2020-03-26,"I would highly recommend this course. The course offers highly relevant, tailored material. The lessons are high quality and easy to follow with a well designed progression track. The supports are brilliant. You gain access to a large supportive community of other students, alumni, tutors, and mentors on Slack. This is an invaluable resource. They pair you with industry experienced mentors that match your study schedule. If you're not happy with your mentor for any reason at all you can switch with no issue's. They have a tutor support section with talented tutors that help you with specific programming problems. They reply very quickly so you won't have to wait long at all. They have a supportive student care department that answers any questions you have. They also call a couple times throughout the course to see how the course is going and if there's anything you have questions about or feedback you have. They are constantly improving their services and use student feedback to direcly help with the changes. They also have a careers advisor who helps you secure a job after the course. I'm very impressed overall with the quality, management, and continuous improvement of this very interesting course. If you are serious about starting on your coding journey then start here!",coursereport
2156,Code institute,2020-03-25,"From my personal experience i think code institute have a great product with material that will help you to learn faster. The mini projects and milestone projects help students to find solutions and make decisions which i think i great for anyone new to software dev. I improved a lot through the milestone projects. The material is great and also the support from tutors was 5 star. I remember reaching out for help around 10pm and getting assistance in solving bugs. The mentorship also was great it helped me a lot as a new developer to understand the ins and outs of handling projects. the coarse can be improved i feel an javascript framework like ReactJS, Angular or Vue would make this course perfect, considering that there are 2 python frameworks already in Flask and Django it would be great to add that. Also i would recommend some class to be live to allow students to asking questions while the teacher is teaching which i think would benefit the students a lot. Other than that this is a good coarse with great support which makes studying online a great experience",coursereport
2157,Code institute,2020-03-23,"Pros: The course is done online, which means you can do it from home and in your own time. There is a supportive community available via Slack - comprising of other students, tutors, and mentors. The course itself includes text lessons and videos. The videos demonstrate how to use the language and provide mini projects you can set up yourself as you follow along. There are 4 Milestone projects that you have to complete, and the real learning happens while you are working on these. As mentioned above, there's plenty of support to help you get over the rough spots and reach your goal. Most importantly the Code Institute values feedback from students and continuously works to improve its course content. Students are kept informed of Events that may be of help to them and are given Career Support as they strive to find roles to match their new skills. Cons: I felt the JavaScript, dc, d3, and API videos were a bit difficult to grasp, and that they were missing basic foundation information that someone with no previous exposure to them would grasp on their own. This made the projects built using these a bit more daunting. JavaScript is not the same as other programming languages and I think it would help to have an initial video explaining the differences - e.g. assigning variables by reference, asynchronous behavior. As regards dc, d3 and APIs, again I think the videos need to start with more basic information explaining the concepts involved.",coursereport
2158,Code institute,2020-03-13,"After leaving a career in the Merchant Navy I found the Code Institute online and began researching careers in Software, from there I did the 5-day challenge and attended an open day here in Cork, after the open night I knew it was something I would pursue. Since starting in June the level of support received from the institute has been outstanding, the online Slack community of students, alumni and mentors is full of people waiting to help, the tutor support has been simply outstanding and the Student Care team is world-class. Coming to the end of the course I started applying for various roles and had help from Jane, the Director of Employer Engagement in the institute, where under her guidance I was able to secure a job starting in the new year, and I hadn't even finished the course yet! I've been in my new job now for 3 months and I love it. Jane's expertise was second to none and without her, the Code Institute and all its support I wouldn't have been able to secure what I can only describe as a perfect fit for me in a new role! If anybody is considering undertaking this course, I can only say ""DO IT"". It's an amazing course that not only teaches you an array of new skills but lets you take your past experiences/interests and hobbies and put them into projects that will essentially get you that job you're after! 15/10 would recommend. Thank you to the Code Institute again!",coursereport
2159,Code institute,2024-11-05,"Fantastic experience. I really enjoyed every day of my study. You can learn how to write your code from other sources, the Code Institute teaches you how to develop a product. Tutor support was just great (also out of business hours), student care very responsive. Assessment team provides detailed reports on your portfolio projects with lots of tips and useful comments. Overall, the course requires dedication (the syllabus is quite dense), one needs to adhere to strict and tight deadlines. Wold I recommend the course? Yes, with no reservations.",coursereport
2160,Code institute,2024-09-30,"During the lockdown, I decided to channel my time and energy into completing the Diploma in Full-Stack Software Development, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It was extremely hands-on, intense, and rewarding. The five-day coding challenge at the beginning made me aware of both my strengths and areas for improvement right from the start. This focus on self-development continued throughout the course. I appreciated the varied teaching methods, from video tutorials to interactive coding challenges, which helped me stay engaged and motivated. The five core projects were particularly beneficial, as they allowed me to apply my learning across HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Django, and more. Each project was completed to the level of deployment and received detailed feedback, which was invaluable for refining my skills. The support systems available, such as one-on-one mentor meetings, Slack channels for peer and mentor discussions, and tutor hours, greatly aided my progress. I am incredibly grateful for the expertise and guidance offered by the Code Institute. The course not only helped me develop as a developer, but also gave me the confidence to participate in an AI hackathon with other alumni, showing that the learning extends far beyond the diploma. I am proud of my achievements and excited to continue growing in this field. The problem-solving skills I developed during the Diploma have also been highly beneficial in my current role as a fund manager. The logical, structured approach to learning new programming languages and frameworks has given me confidence in my ability to quickly adapt to new digital tools in the financial sector. For instance, I have recently begun learning Baseline and Alteryx, and the mindset I honed during the course helps me trust my capacity to grasp these tools efficiently. The course has reinforced my belief that with the right approach, I can continually evolve in my understanding of technology, which is becoming increasingly essential in my role. I look forward to expanding my knowledge of digital tools and applying this type of thinking to further enhance my professional capabilities.",coursereport
2161,Code institute,2024-09-10,"This was an amazing learning experience. It can be thug at times but it is worth every second and ounce of effort. I would recommend if you want to learn the inner workings of a full stack development workflow. Python, Javascript, and the overall structure is great from start to finish getting more challenging as you go.",coursereport
2162,Code institute,2024-09-06,I feel that I enjoyed more because I took part in Hackathons regularly and befriended many other students on slack. I found the last project extremely tough but enjoyed the challenge and there was plenty of help provided even though I tended not to take advantage of it when I should have. Thanks to all the instructors and fellow graduates.,coursereport
2163,Code institute,2024-09-02,"I recently completed a year-long Diploma in Full Stack Software Development with Code Institute, and overall, it was a transformative experience that has significantly enhanced my skills and understanding of the software development field. This was a brand new journey for me having no experience in coding previously and plying my trade as a Paramedic for over a decade. It was challenging throughout as I was working full-time also, and deadlines for projects needed to be met but I got my Diploma in the end. It is a full on course with lots of learning to be done in the year so expect long hours and late nights. There are support networks in course facilitators, Slack groups, student support and mentors which I would advise to use as much as possible. Don't be afraid to ask for help, there is always someone that is willing to assist you.",coursereport
2164,Code institute,2024-08-13,"The course structure is well-planned, and the content is generally good. The videos are easily accessible, but I sometimes found myself missing more detailed documentation. Rather than just providing external links, it would be beneficial to have more in-depth resources directly available on the platform. I often found myself turning to Google instead of finding the information I needed on the learning site. The LMS (Learning Management System) site is functional, but the content could be better organized. Currently, you see all 40-50 links at once, with additional sub-links under each, which can feel overwhelming and difficult to navigate. A ""card"" or box solution that groups the five different modules and their required materials would make the learning process more efficient. A crucial aspect of any online course is ensuring that the integrated development environment (IDE) functions smoothly. Unfortunately, I encountered significant issues with Codeanywhere, which was later switched to Gitpod. The platform was incredibly slow, and I estimate that I lost about four weeks due to these issues. I often had to work nights and weekends, far exceeding 40 hours a week, just to keep up. Regarding the course projects, I found the jump between Project 3 and Project 4 to be quite steep. It might be more beneficial to combine the first three projects into two, allowing for more time to focus on the fourth project, which was almost too large in scope. On a positive note, the instructors and career team were excellent. They seemed genuinely engaged in the students' progress and success, which I greatly appreciated. However, my greatest disappointment was with the mentors. I didn’t receive much feedback from them, and arranging meetings felt more like a formality than a source of support. I essentially completed the projects on my own, with minimal input from my mentor. It would be more effective to have instructors review the projects at some midpoint, providing feedback that could be acted upon before the final submission. While the feedback I received after submitting a project was detailed, it often came too late to be of immediate benefit.",coursereport
2165,Code institute,2024-07-24,"This course is amazing so long as you are able to motivate yourself. It doesn't just flood you with information, but through a combination of videos, challenges and portfolio projects allows you to not just learn the information provided by the course, but skills to learn additional information and create independently. It also has Hackathons which students can take advantage of so that team work skills development. Mentors and content are very good to assist with your learning. Comprehensive course.",coursereport

2167,Code institute,2024-07-11,"I managed to get the job I was looking for less than a month after submitting my last project. Despite the course gives you the tools to work as a junior full stack developer I managed to find a job as senior Bioinformatician, by choosing the predictive analytics specialization. As mentioned above the course gives you the skills the work as Junior Full Stack Developer with an average salary of 35000 £ in the UK. Therefore, I found the advertisent a bit confusing as it looked like that after the course you could start earning 50000 £ on average. 50000 £ in the UK is the salary you will get after 2 years of commercial experience, right after the end of the course the salary is on average 35000 £ in the UK. The skills you get are exactly what the market expects from you as junior full stack developer, with a particular focus on the front end. The Career advisors are always available, I got an interview with a very short notice, nevertheless they setup a meeting and provided useful feedbacks and suggestions. The mentors are not all at the same level, I had 4 different mentors, and only 1 of them was really looking at the repo and providing useful feedback. Luckly he assisted me from project 2 fo project 4. I was forced to change him for the last project as he could not assist me with it. The other mentors gave me the feeling they were not looking at the repo at all, and only provided very broad advice depending on your questions. Overall, I strongly advice to enroll if your aim is to start a career as junior developer.",coursereport
2168,Code institute,2024-06-13,"Pros: I found the first four projects challenging and enjoyable. The mentoring structure is excellent. Student care team was very helpful. A good deal of the course was well structured and informative, especially HTML and CSS content. I learnt a great deal overall. Cons: Some of the content was poor. Design Thinking stands out as the worst and a quick search on slack will tell you most people skipped over this module entirely. Linking concepts in latter projects seemed a bit disjointed. The agile section shows you the preferred tool for implementing the methodology which in fairness was decent. Cut to lessons for e commerce project 5 and the instructor was using a spreadsheet. Project 5 was a let down for me. The content was outdated (Stripe card elements deprecated and JQuery) and the module content was not particularly engaging. Overall the course is good. The Irish government paid for me to do it via Springboard so I can’t really comment on value for money.",coursereport
2169,Code institute,2024-06-12,I definitely feel like this is a worthwhile course if you are looking for a career change and you are technically minded.

2170,Code institute,2023-08-27,"The course layout is not very well structured. Going from 1 coding language to the next. You're constantly doubting yourself if you study in the right way. Worst of all, if you start to get behind, it's basically over. There's not a lot of support. The time schedule is basically holy. It seems like they want you to finish the course as soon as possible so they can welcome new recruits. It's like a factory and you're the product.

2173,Code institute,2022-04-20,"I just completed Code Institute’s e-commerce path and the past year has been very impactful for me. The course was fully remote and I’ve been impressed throughout the course of how this was handled as it’s not easy to put together content, support, and networking opportunities for people across borders and in different time zones. I am very satisfied with the outcome, and although you can technically learn all of this via other (free) paths you will not have the same support, nor a diploma to show to future employers. The standards they expect you to follow are strict, but fair, and just the fact that you have the purchase of the course + expectations + deadlines weighing on you will push you to reach your goals. You have plenty of support and I never experienced poor or delayed feedback to my questions or concerns. After completing the course you have it on paper that you can create fully functional full stack e-commerce applications in line with university/industry standards. The content is very engaging and helpful and they give you a clear path to your goal. They don’t teach you everything (you find out during the course that it would pretty much be impossible), but they give you the tools you need in videos, quizzes, and exercises, and they have a ton of slack groups that are really helpful. Also, they offer a lot of courses on LinkedIn, job hunting in general, and share job posts all over Europe every day. About the negative: On a personal note I started to feel the solitude a bit, but that we mostly due to me doing the course over a year. You can do it in a few months, and that would probably have been better. In any case you have to get used to mostly everything being via text or video, so whenever you have a questions you have to be prepared to be proactive, search the Slack forums for info, and always type out and post your problem(s) instead of explaining them in person. You get used to this, but if you do the course over a year you may start to miss face to face interactions. Also be aware that the company is based in Dublin and the careers team is mostly engaged in the UK. They will share job posts from different countries but the majority of them are in the UK. This is just a little side note and did not subtract from all the other great content they had. Overall: I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning how to code. You start from scratch and work your way up to understand complicated flows to produce and realise a plethora of projects. I can only speak for myself but I at least feel confident in starting a junior developer position with the knowledge I now have.",coursereport

2181,Code institute,2022-03-05,"Firstly – I apologise for the novel. This is only the highlights from the issues I and my class faced while attending a course with this college. All issues can be backed with evidence if requested. I would like to convey very clearly that I am exceptionally unimpressed with this course. I have found it far below the standards that I would expect from a course partnered with UCD (well technically UCD Professional Academy). Furthermore, I feel the cost of €7995 cannot possibly be justified given the poor quality of the teaching and the course material itself. I would strongly recommend you do not partake in this course. There are so many other Bootcamps and code course out there. Don't let the fact that this course is partnered with UCD or supposedly has ""college accreditation"" mislead you. Changing assessment criteria while students are actively working on the projects in question (initially without telling the applicable students). When this was raised a response of ""simplifying assessment criteria to inflate pass rates is acceptable because employers will not know and it is done all the time in third level education""... This, in my opinion, is just wrong and confirms that this certificate will not have any real industry value. Course content issues:- Recommended tools do not provide sufficient functionality for merit/distinction grading (ie using github projects as a full Agile project management tool for linking epics to user stories to tasks and bugs)- Much of the content is almost a carbon copy of that found on freecodecamp and codcademy sites- Walkthrough code supplied on the college GitHub, doesn’t align with the video project walkthroughs and often has errors which are detrimental to the operation of the program- Numerous spelling errors and typos across the online content- When a student does raise a bug/issue/typo, there is no open communication, instead defensive responses, (therefore personally I have ceased to raise defects/bugs) The Masterclass promise was: “…there will be 8 x 7.5 hour Masterclass sessions to complement your online learning. The first seven sessions are hackathons, designed to develop your practical competencies, challenge your problem-solving abilities and advance your understanding of the concepts that you are learning. Each session aligns with one of the mini-projects within the course…”Only the first Masterclass included a hackathon, all others contained a limited morning of ""lectures"" followed by an afternoon of ""time to work on our projects"". Facilitation courses- Contained lectures which regurgitated course content, not the class discussions/learning sessions promised- One class didn't even occur, it was rescheduled after the fact. Mentoring sessions. Promised at 1hr each. Halfway through the course these were reduced to 30 mins. I was lucky, my mentor, who no longer works with CI, was amazing, but I have heard so many horror stories from fellow students. Tutor support- This is a text based message service that you can only avail of if you use Gitpod (the college recommended developer platform)- Spent almost 2 hours on the line to troubleshoot an issue, the initial agent couldn't help me and was only ""online for another 15mins"" so put me back to the queue. Left the call with no answer (took a Dev at my day job 5mins to trouble shoot the issue)- Next time I tried to use Tutor support I was informed I had used up my Allowed time and took over an hour to receive a response, after another hour without response I decided it was a waste of time.(issue was determined to be with Gitpod, all issues stopped once I started using VS Code)- Unless you develop your project exactly as per the video examples, tutor support cannot help you The college does not understand the difference between Unit tests and automated/manual functional testing. This is a developer course that does not require the creation of unit tests, but will fail you if you do not breach Facebook T&Cs and create a fake Facebook Business page for a project... During the process of dealing with my complaint (yes, I raised all of these issues with the ""college"" in a process that took months) they appointed an individual to be a Cohort Coordinator for UCD. A meeting was requested and agreed and then the Cohort Coordinator failed to respond/confirm/attend. I was passed around until I reached the Customer Relations Manager for UCD Professional Academy. During this call, the manager admitted that mistakes have been made with this course and that the level of service provided has not met the expectations of any party involved, and an offer was made for a €1,000 refund and the ability to attend a different course (neither of which I accepted). During this call the Cohort Coordinator made false accusation of ""Aggressive"" messaging (which are unfounded, and I am more than happy to provide proof) and informed me I should cease to use the group channels when asking questions (even if the questions effect other students). To make such an accusation during a complaint resolution call is deflective and inappropriate. It goes to show how little Code Institute care about its students and how inexperienced the company is as a whole. From my experience, most of the students that are employed after completing this course, are employed directly by the college. Do not let the partnership with UCD fool you. This course is definitely not value for money. It is not consistent in its assessments and all of the content can be learnt elsewhere for free, or for a small fee if you prefer a more structured approach.",coursereport

Another great aspect of this course is its hackathons which allow students to develop a project as part of a team and get some real collaborative developing experience under the guidance of an industry professional.

Along with the projects and study, we can partake in different Hackathons throughout the year. If you want to learn more about software development and coding languages, I would highly recommend this course. Even if you start with minimal knowledge, the materials are so understandable that you can complete it.",coursereport
2188,Code institute,2021-06-11,"The only positive thing they have is the tutors that are helpful and responsive. The rest was handled terribly. This whole move from AWS to GitPod made me lose the project I almost finished. They could do nothing to restore it and eventually they just ignored this issue. In the beginning of my course, so that I was already frustrating. Following this, it has been 3 months since I submitted my final assignment, I heard no response on it and still no certificate. I contacted student care hoping this would get resolved and the issue is still not resolved by the deadline they gave me and no response to my email inquiries. I am at a loss of words about what a waste of money this course is. Especially considering how expensive it is. I regret wasting my own money and would never recommend this course to anyone.",coursereport
2189,Code institute,2021-03-29,"I just received my certificate after a year of coding and studying. I know that they are a lot of coding tutorials and courses everywhere ... but the support, projects, and mentoring programs in Code Institute are the reason I can call myself a software developer... Not only that but the career support team are doing a great job as well to prepare students for the tech market. I highly recommend Code Institute for anyone wanna learn software development.",coursereport
2190,Code institute,2021-03-26,"You can learn all by yourself and become a competent developer. However, when you are just starting out with total unfamiliarity in the field, my experience is that it helps immensely to have some structure, guidance and support. The overall cost was expensive, but well worth it, given that you not only gain a skill but a university accredited diploma. Rest assured going through the course I will not have to spend a single penny to learn further in the area of web-development. Certainly, I don't have all the skills to jump into a career right away, and I don't think any boot-camp experience solely can make that happen. Nevertheless, with the skill I have gained from CI course I can now manage to learn further on my own with the available free resources in the internet. The tutor support are okay as the waiting time for support can sometime be frustrating if you are time-bounded. In-industry mentors are assigned to a student to provide guidance with the milestone projects. There is a slack community where you can ask/contribute and get help with course/coding related issues from other experienced students and community members. The lessons are updated and the available content are on par as a stepping stone to the real in-demand skills required in the field of Web development.",coursereport
2191,Code institute,2021-02-15,"If you would like to change your career path this is the right course for you. I started my course almost two years ago and while learning it a lot happened in my life. People from CI Student Care were there for me all the time. When I have my back problems and I couldn't finish my projects on time.. there were also there for me when my personal life changed by 180 degrees... They are creating a great community of students, mentors, tutors, and Student Care team, and many many more. It's not only a normal online course where you learning how to make your first steps with coding. It is also a group of people that are here always for you to help, say a good word, and help you with anything you need. Mentors? I had 3 different Mentors on my journey. USA, United Kingdom, they're from everywhere, believe me. They are not only mentors but after time, they are becoming friends. Giving you support when you need it, having fun during the online sessions always. As I mentioned earlier, they're people for people, not robots. Even, if this is programming, hehe. Course material and information? Everything well prepared and presented on their online platform. Easy to use navigation, very intuitive. On Course you can find the text to read, videos with explanations and also great and funny games, tests to check what you have learned. You will start learning basics and then more and more and more, as more you will learn, the more you will understand and programming will become great fun! This course will open your mind and give you possibilities to push yourself to your limits you never knew. After course I've opened my private company and my online store on one of the platforms. I never thought I will be able to do it. When I am looking into the past, I am laughing at myself I was scared of programming and I didn't start it earlier as I should. I am strongly recommending the Course for everyone who wants to learn and understand programming.",coursereport
2192,Code institute,2021-01-29,"This course is an excellent introduction the to most used languages on the internet. It's divided in modules on the following main order: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. Exercises and mock-up projects are well structure with videos and exercises. Excellent tutoring platform, they were always eager to help me in the most kind and understanding way, a big thank ye for that.",coursereport
2193,Code institute,2020-12-11,"Great course with support from Slack community (other students), tutor support, student care and a assigned mentor for you four milestone projects. You get to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python as the main languages. Also frameworks, libraries and tools as Bootstrap, Materialize, jQuery, Flask, Django, Git, Github, MongoDB, MySQL, Heroku and much more. It's a lot to learn and many threshold along the way, butt it's worth it at the end! Good luck future students and never give up!",coursereport
2194,Code institute,2020-11-24,"Online, part-time bootcamp helping you to become an independent full stack webdeveloper. Put in the time as is suggested at the start of the course and you will become a confident coder that can start a new career with an impressive portfolio.

The online videos lay a good foundation but the projects are where you prove yourself. Just like a real job, you have to dig for answers online and join chats with peers and mentors to come to one of the hundreds of solutions for success. I'm very happy that I preserved through this course. It wasn't easy, but I learned a lot. It's helped me boost my confidence in my ability to learn new things and already paid for itself through advancing in my career.",coursereport
2197,Code institute,2020-10-16,"Throughout the Code Institute course I felt like I had regular and accessible support despite it all being online. I was happy to receive a check up phone call once a month to look into whether I had any problems that needed addressing and to make sure I was on track with my schedule. The online support team were amazing, very helpful and friendly, progress on my milestone projects would have ground to a halt at times if not for them. Biggest regret was not using them earlier. I feel like the syllabus covers a good deal of content to give me a comfortable grounding in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python, and I graduated the course with a portfolio of 4 site that I am very proud of. Since graduating I am in contact with the careers team who are very helpful in guiding my next steps.",coursereport

2199,Code institute,2020-07-31,"I give this course a five-star rating! I stumbled across this course on a Facebook Add and the 5-day code challenge that you could take made me curious. I did the challenge and attended the free seminar that was held in Stockholm. I have not regretted enrolling and taking the leap into coding and Code Institute has given me a great experience. I started the course as a total novice and got a First Class Honor Diploma. This is my one-year story: When I contacted Code Institute they were very helpful and gave me all the information that I needed to feel comfortable enrolling and applying for a Swedish CSN loan to finance the course. Once up an rolling I was assigned a mentor and all my initial setup (slack, contacts, info etc). I started the course modules and followed along with the videos. When it was time for my first contact with my mentor I was very excited and was looking forward to this first step in my new programming career. However, I was very disappointed after speaking to my mentor so I contacted the Student care office and they were super helpful and listened to my thoughts and experience from my contact with my mentor. After a day or two I was assigned a new mentor and this time everything was great. My mentor (Marantha) was great, he gave me very good advice and really helped me on my path through my four projects. I would have never gotten the First Class Honors Diploma without the help from him. The mentoring part is really great and you get mentored by a professional developer that will guide you through your projects. We talked via Skype and shared screens so that he could see my code and make instant comments, this was very helpful. Apart from my mentor I also got fantastic help from the different tutors that are available in the modules. The tutors helped me when I was stuck on a part of a project and they hinted me to the solutions, which is much better than just getting the correct code. I also had great help from the Slack community in each module. I collaborated with other student and asked for help and also gave some small advice on problems that I had solved. There are several different channels that you can use and they are topic specific which made them very useful. Each module consisted of videos to follow along that showed you the specific topic to prepare you for the upcoming project that you coded at the end of each module. What would have benefited me a lot was if there had been a Python beginners tutorial option that I could have used. A lot of the coding was done with Python and when I had completed the course I felt that I had to take a beginners course in Python. When I did this so many things cleared up for me. There was several things that I got working in the projects but I didn't have complete understanding of the code. I felt that this is fully understandable since I was a complete beginner when enrolling, but a beginners course in Python would have cut my time with several weeks. The back office in Code Institute are great and they are very helpful and they are really trying their best to quickly answer your questions or solve a problem that you might have. I got some really good help to modify my LinkedIn profile and make it more appealing. Overall I think that this is a great course and it gives you a very broad (but not so deep) knowledge base to stand on when you move into the development career! You also build four projects that you can show to new potential employers, I think this is so much more helpful than doing exams and getting a grade on the exam. I give this course a five-star rating and I can really recommend it based on my personal experience throughout these 16 months it took me to complete the course.",coursereport
2200,Code institute,2020-07-15,"Great material, the tutors and my mentor were very helpful at all the time. During this course I learned all the skills that I need to acquire a job as Developer.",coursereport
2201,Code institute,2020-06-23,"This course is such a waste of money and I would urge people to look elsewhere. For example www.skillcrush.com is similar and much cheaper. Also another one here on Udacity https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044 Each module in Code Institute is very basic and the quizzes afterwards have nothing to do with what you have learnt. The response from ""customer care"" is that you need to learn how to search for answers. So in essence, you pay thousands of euros to learn how to google. They say there is 24 hour support but that is just slack. There are so many people asking questions that you get drowned out by the despair of other users who also realised they have also wasted their money. All videos are created using Cloud9 but you have to use Gitpod which is very different. There are errors in the videos. There are spelling mistakes. I could go on but it's depressing.",coursereport

2203,Code institute,2020-06-12,"For the past 18 months, I took part in the Full Stack Software Development Course with Code Institute. Now that I've finished, I can honestly say that it was the best decision I ever made. Code Institute has a friendly team who genuinely care about their students & are willing to take the time to get the best out of them. The course material is extensive & are continuously adding & updating. The tutor assistance has been excellent & are willing to take the time to make sure that you not only get the right outcome to a problem but that you understand exactly what it means. My mentor Spencer was absolutely brilliant & was always there even in his own time to make sure I was getting the most out of my potential. Slack has been an excellent platform for asking questions as people are willing to help every step of the way. Also after the course, they have a career's assistance team who will help with things such as CV's, interview questions & also take your preferences into consideration. For anybody seeking a new career in Software Development to have you ready to take the next step, I can't recommend this course enough. Yes, it's challenging but people are there to help you every step of the way.",coursereport
2204,Code institute,2020-04-21,"Did this full time. Not worth the money. I was very unhappy with my final grade but they just shrugged their shoulders. Also a lot of their content was outdated. Also a lot you have to research yourself and if you wanted to ask a tutor with a problem, they dont answer anything but they speak in riddles sometimes to get you to think. I dont think it was adapted properly to someone who has never done coding before. All very well if you have some level of experience or doing it through work. Some of the tutors were nice. I got some basic understanding from the course but I would think twice before pursuing it. If company is paying for it etc then by all means but sorry it didn't live up to my expectations whatsoever.",coursereport

2207,Code institute,2020-03-24,"Overall, out of all the things I learnt from this course was sticking to my tasks when it got difficult. Completing a milestone project can be tough. You have to get through alot of learning content, and then apply your own real world project. After submission, despite being tired, you start again on to the next learning materials. The feeling of panic, thinking that i cant do it, that my code is not very good, that i just don't get it is was really important for me - its important because you need to get over it. Towards the end of the course, I was much calmer at not knowing something - i started to have faith that I will figure it out or that i will somehow find a way - which happens. I also started to appreciate how important it is that i take more time to plan my projects - to process my thinking so that i am clear and structured. I am still bad at this but I know its important !! Regardless of the fact its a Software Developer course, what was great for me was getting a taste of what is out there - what am i passionate about, what are the things i dont enjoy, what are my strengths, and what weaknesses can i improve. For anyone with no prior experience with doing frontened, backend projects - this is a great start. I had some previous HTML/CSS/JS experience, but was blown away how poor my code was. What I really enjoyed about the programme was that the message was always clear and simple - everything we do is for the user. I know this sounds obvious, but Code Institute really put a big focus on this so that the smallest of details which fails to meet user experience will cause loss of marks. Installing good habits like UX ( testing and documentation ) is an invaluable experience for any developer. Its a important start because I now feel that i have a standard of code that i am proud of - and that everyday I will now find new ways to better myself. Code Institute gave me the platform that i needed so that i can self learn and develop. We can all learn things from the internet - udemy, youtube etc - I do it now. However, there are many important skills and experiences that can only be learnt from courses like Code Institute - Project Deadlines, sacrificing your time to learn, learning to reach out for help and going to bed feeling tired, frustrated, dejected but waking up in the morning with a new drive to get the job done!! As i said, reaching out for help is important and the staff and the slack community are amazing - regardless of the problem, the support team take the time to support you and help you understand the issues. Joining Code Institute was the best decision I have made in what i am sure will be a fun career in Software Development.",coursereport
2208,Code institute,2020-03-23,"This course is both fun and thorough, I heartily recommend it. It starts with the basics of HTML and guides you through the process all the way to Python and Django. The syllabus is dynamic and material is regularly reviewed and updated. The course material is well presented in a series of bite sized videos. The videos come with a link to a github repository where needed and some of lessons include a responsive work space to try things for yourself. Sections are closed with a mini-quiz to help you gauge your progress and there are walk through mini-projects to illustrate methods and techniques. The coursework component is made up of 4 milestone projects which you will plan with your mentor. Build on your own and then submit after review and snd adjustment with your mentor. Mentors are all experienced developers with valuable insights into the industry. The Code Institute is both supportive and helpful. When I raised issues, be it a failure of comprehension on my part or a failure on their part the response was rapid and effective. The tutor service is available to help most of the day and able to rapidly guide you to a solution. Student Care are well informed and helpful finding solutions and supporting students so you can concentrate on code and learning and not administrative or timing problems. Some of the videos were recorded at a lower volume and I found myself having to listen to a section more than once on some occasions. Though on the whole I didn't consider audio or video quality to be an issue. Occasionally on some of the walk through mini-projects, where there was a little more going on, the link to the git hub repository for that lesson was a step out of sync and I had to look ahead. The Slack channel is a fantastic resource, the other students are helpful and supportive and being themselves students understand what you were going through when you encounter a problem. The Code Institute staff are also on the Slack channel and respond quickly to any problems.",coursereport
2209,Code institute,2020-03-23,"The Fullstack development course is a very valuable and informative. The course material is clear and to the point, the assignments make sense and the grading is fair. I found that completed assignments were more clearly marked than I had experienced in college. I was able to see where I needed improvement and to focus on that for the next assignment. Personally this level of feedback is how I prefer to lern and it was a breath of fresh air. Between staff, mentor, alumni and fellow students available on the Slack channel, there was plenty of support. I couldn't recommend it enough.",coursereport
2210,Code institute,2019-08-28,"I signed up to this course back in 2017 when their entire learning platform was TEXT ONLY. I was stupidly lured in by the idea of having an 'accredited diploma' by the end of it so thought it was a good idea. It most certainly WAS NOT. The first iteration of their course was full of spelling and punctuation mistakes, grammatical errors and just poorly worded material. This did not give me much confidence right from the outset. I struggled with the materials for a long time and almost gave up then they decided they wanted to change the entire platform to videos. The streams and projects changed and it left me confused as to where I should carry on. I called the institute and was told it would probably be best to just start all over again. Right. OK. When I first started looking into coding I wasn't really aware of many of the resources out there which is why I regrettably ended up going with The Code Institute. But by the time they had switched to this new video platform I was now well aware of the multitude of resources and the high standards that were offered, both paid and for free. This new learning platform was, quite simply, a complete and utter joke. People are reading from scripts, stumbling their words, coughing and clearing their throats, mumbling and several sections had background noise, as if they had been recorded in someone's bedroom. The tutors are dull, boring, monotone and extremely hard to engage with. I would follow lessons through in meticulous detail only to find the code had changed very subtly from one lesson to the next and then the entire project wouldn't work. I would spend hours tearing my hair out trying to figure out what was wrong and over time it became more and more frustrating. The content of the course, compared to other resources, is quite simply DREADFUL. The new learning platform was released in 2017 and even now in 2019 as I write this it hasn't been updated. Instead there are lazy banners in red at the top of the screen informing of any changes, later versions of tech required or any mistakes that had been identified. Er, I have paid you £5k for this course, how about you record some new material! LAZY! Mentors. First one was rubbish, then he quit. Second one kept cancelling then he quit. Last one was great so can't fault him but be aware that you only get 3 x 45 min-1hour sessions to 'go over' your projects before you submit them. Not a lot of support for £5k. Tech support - sometimes ok, most of the time were pretty dismissive and unhelpful. I would have been quicker to just use Google or Stack Overflow. Sorry, why did I pay £5k again? Its now August 2019 and I have given up on the course and found a face to face one for HALF THE PRICE. Nobody from Code Institute has bothered to even call or email to see how I am getting on or offer any help. Disgusting service, but who cares, they've got my money now. For anyone wanting to learn to code DO NOT BOTHER with this rubbish institution. Their materials are awful, content outdated and you will be learning a technology stack that has fewer job opportunities than other courses out there. There are far less Python jobs on the market than, say React, just have a look on a job search engine. My advice if you are going to teach yourself.. Udemy, Free Code Camp, YouTube, then maybe join a local coding group and build your skills from there. You can get WAY better content than this on udemy for around £12 for a full stack bootcamp course. Why would you actually choose to pay £5k for something you can get at a fraction of the cost at a much much higher quality elsewhere. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS I DID. Finally, don't be fooled by a diploma. Nobody gives a sh*t. Can you code? Do you have a portfolio? Can you demonstrate your skills in an interview? Their diploma is accredited in Scotland and several English universities that I contacted said it would not be accepted for any formal entrance requirements to higher education courses, so again, why waste your money? Oh and one other thing. If you don't complete the course within the given timeframe (12 or 18 months I can't remember) they will charge you £100 per month for every additional month you need the materials to be able to continue your studies! WHAAAAT?! GO ELSEWHERE GUYS! I wish I had never come across this awful business called Code Institute! :-(",coursereport
2211,Code institute,2019-03-09,"I spent £5000 on the full stack web developer course and was very disappointed at the assessment criteria and then even more disappointed at being charged an extra £100 on top of the £5000 already paid to resubmit an assessment.

2212,Code institute,2024-08-27,"For experienced developers, there are plenty of valuable resources available for free. However, if you're a beginner, this program can be a good starting point.

The community is vibrant and supportive, providing an ideal environment for learning and collaboration. Monthly hackathons offer a realistic experience of a working environment, teaching essential skills that are difficult to acquire on your own. My best advice is to approach every challenge with determination—more often than not, you'll find a solution. If you hit a roadblock, the tutor service is there to guide you. The only downside is that some of the course material is slightly outdated, but updates are in progress, and older content is being swiftly replaced.",coursereport

2215,Code institute,2023-04-11,"Completed the C.I Full-Stack Diploma in E-Commerce Applications this year and overall when looking back, I can’t say I’m much more than moderately satisfied. The course material is decent, but is in dire need of a massive update to keep up with other courses out there. The cost of the course has gone up since I enrolled, and I don’t see the justification for it either. The mentorship is a bit misleading as you only get someone to basically go over your projects with you 3 times and they aren’t there to mentor you through the course as the name might suggest. The course also puts you together with other students regardless of prior coding experience, so a beginner coder is at a massive disadvantage compared to someone who has prior coding experience or a degree in CS. I think they should address this by splitting the course into two different categories to account for this or have more lenient marking for students without that background as an advantage. There’s a lively slack community and you can ask for help on there. But for the most part you’re on your own and will find yourself using resources such as W3School, MDN or Youtube tutorials to teach some material to be honest. There were several bugs and issues with some of the walkthrough content, especially between PP3 and PP4, and disappointingly PP5 was just the old MS4 recycled into this new course. On the plus side, you do get an EQF Level 5 at the end of it all. Though I am not sure I can say I feel like a qualified Software Developer as I hold the certificate in my hand.",coursereport
2216,Code institute,2023-01-23,"I have currently been a ""student"" of this deplorable bootcamp for the past 4 1/2 months. I am also going through the bootcamp through Springboard which makes is absolutley free for me. Paying €8,000 for this course is the equivalent of throwing your money into the fire. 1. The course is outdated. Several videos are 2-3 years old with a comment box above the videos saying how to ""remedy"" the issue. Which in my case mostly never works as the ""remedy is often outdated aswell"" 2. The way the ""instructors"" teach is horrific, they fly through the videos telling you what to do but not actually offering anything of informative value. They are all just code along videos which doesnt help anyone. It just makes you walkthrough dependant. 3. From what I have learned while trying to become a software developer is that you must google everytthing which is perfectly fine. But if you spend €8,000 euro on a course they damn well better try and help you to the best of their ability and have as much content on their page as possible. Which they don't, I have spent 90% of my time on other sites I.E Coding with Mosh, YouTube and W3schools learning as the CI's attmept to teach is pathetic. 4. Up until project 4, the course is a solid 3/5, as you can teach basic HTML, CSS, JS, Python to anyone. When it gets to project 4 and you actually have to start coding and relaly learning the course just becomes a joke. I could write all day but im just drained from this ""Bootcamp"". Biggest waste of 4 1/2 months. Thank God I didnt pay for it.",coursereport
2217,Code institute,2022-09-14,"I would not recommend this Full Stack course with the Code Institute to anyone due to my experience with them. I applied and took on the 5 day challenge , Unfortunately I hadto request 2 days extension due to my laptop breaking but that was granted until Monday I was told. Monday morning I submitted the completed challenge with a 100% mark. First off , I will admit the lessons provided were very good and I learned the basics pretty quickly and it has inspired me to start a proper Honours Degree in Software Development , so thanks for that. But anyway I was told a few hours after my submission that my application was unsuccessful , so naturally I enquired as I figured a 100% mark was more than sufficient. I received an email the following day to inform me that the reason behind my application being denied was due to my extension request? Along with sections 2 & 3 of the coding challenge workbook being failed submissions. Unfortunately the coding application provided by the Code Institute for their 5 Day Coding Challenge is subpar to real world coding as the application did not recognize certain parts of the workbook in sections 2 & 3. I got very frustrated with this code constantly failing that I referred to a professional who confirmed my lines of code were in fact correct , so I submitted the correct code (marked as failed on their system) so I could view the ""Solution"" offered ,the solution and my ""incorrect submissions"" were the exact same lines of code. I also highlighted this issue in my application in the event that the Code Institute was not aware of this issue but it was marked as a reason for my denied application. ( Maybe they weren't too happy that I pointed this out ) Bottom line , I would not recommend this course based off of my experience with them and I personally wouldn't pay the near €7k price tag.",coursereport
2218,Code institute,2021-08-16,"This was my second time signing up for a Code Institute Hackathon in as many months, as I'd enjoyed the Pride-themed one back in June so much and found it had sharpened my coding and teamwork skills considerably. Once again, I got to work alongside fellow students of various experience levels and backgrounds in sprint-based collaborative bursts as we grappled with an unfamiliar topic/technology (game development on this occasion). And once more my biggest takeaway was that, while the learning content that makes up CI's Full Stack Diploma course is great, there really is no substitute for being brought out of your comfort zone and given a strict deadline to work against... Over the course of five adrenaline-fuelled days, we pooled our skills and each played a part in building a pretty cool '80s-inspired arcade shoot 'em up. And although our project didn't end up winning, the competition aspect was eclipsed by the overall experience factor in terms of learning to coordinate group workflow and implement best practices around version control (etc.) - with the added bonus of gaining new connections and having lots of fun thrown in for good measure. There's no doubt about it, remote bootcamp learning can be a solitary path at times, even allowing for the fact that we as CI students have access to several pillars of support (Slack, mentors, tutoring etc.). So to have these hackathons available as an extra-curricular outlet every couple of months goes a long way towards redressing this balance in my view. They've given me such a shot in the arm, in fact, that I've made reference to my hackathon experiences to date in a couple of recent job interviews! TL;DR: If you're reading this and wondering if you should sign up for the next CI Hackathon, I can wholeheartedly recommend it as a great way of levelling up your dev skills and having something tangible and worthwhile to talk about with prospective employers ;-)",coursereport
2219,Code institute,2021-07-31,"There are 4 practical projects that you can show up in your github and a lot of practising exercises on each of the 4 big modules. The course curriculum is really good and well structured it is including the latest real contents currently used in companies, I've seen many of the contents used in the start up tech company, where I used to work. The student portal used to have frequent errors, at least in the time I did the course, although is easy to use, (moving among lessons inside one module is easy) but very annoying when trying to move among modules to one specific lesson, I missed a more accessible/less-clicks/page reloads way to get to any point of any module. Deadlines are VERY rigid for finishing the projects, if you are currently a full-time employee (normal 8h/day) is practically impossible to really learn everything from the course, you can finish the course and follow it yes, but you will finish with the feeling of not really learning, because you are constantly rushing to get to deadlines, moving to the next lesson without being able to go deeper as long you need in any specific topic.You will end up with a vague general understanding of each field, definitely not enough for the price of the course.I would recommend this course only if you are not full-time employed and if you have money. ProsThe course curriculum, and the students community in Slack ConsWay too expensive for the kind of ""support"" you actually receive.Most of the time you end up asking among the other students community rather than getting actual support from mentors, as they are only there for general guidance in your projects, not to help you solve code problems.Your access to the portal and study contents is removed once you finish the course, which to me makes no sense at all, and forces you to take extra separate notes, using more time for notes that could be used to actually practice. The interviews/job finding preparation is a joke, you can get the same advice and support anywhere free in internet as they don't communicate with you directly.The last module of the course corresponding to the last project, is way too long in content/complexity compared with the rest of the other 3 modules, which is normal but you still have the same time to complete it than the previous, which adds additional pressure.",coursereport

Even in London, without a proper degree and/or years of experience, you're not getting £31k from doing a course like Code Institute. I thought quite well of them and was genuinely considering trying to financially position myself to complete the course but given the months of being hounded by their marketing department and asking questions, when I made it clear I knew I was being manipulated in bad faith they, funnily enough, just stopped responding. I did remove myself from the mailing list but they made no effort to correct my interpretation of their actions when I made it explicitly clear I didn't think they had my best interests at heart and, as such, found it difficult to believe I'd be efficiently taught any skills I would be required to have upon taking a job after completion.",coursereport

The Community Managers, the whole team and fortunately my course partners were supportive from the start. I felt very well looked after, valued and supported throughout the course.

Those who feel underchallenged can always try their hand at bonus tasks. I have found the WBS instructors to be very well organised and very competent in over 95% of cases. Questions are answered individually, understandably and with a lot of patience - even in large groups. Another plus is the career guidance, which makes it clear that this is a serious training programme.

The hands-on projects allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios, significantly enhancing my learning process.Teamwork was another highlight of the bootcamp. Despite the remote setting for most of the program, collaboration with peers was seamless and productive. The instructors played a pivotal role in this, providing invaluable insights and guidance that fostered both individual and team growth. Their expertise and dedication were truly commendable, making the learning journey even more enriching.The last two weeks on campus added a different dimension to the experience. Although only a few of us could attend in person, the time spent on campus was still valuable. It offered a chance for more direct interaction and networking, which was beneficial. While it would have been ideal to have the entire cohort present, the hybrid format still delivered an exceptional educational experience.Overall, this bootcamp was a transformative experience, equipping me with practical skills and a strong professional network. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to advance their knowledge and career in a dynamic and supportive environment.",coursereport
2262,WBS coding school,2024-05-18,"After navigating through some tough personal times, the Data Science Bootcamp at WBS Coding School gave my life a new foundation and a new direction! From my first contact with the company, I felt welcomed, accepted and cared for. They gave a clear presentation of what was to come and took the time to answer all my questions. In no way did the conversation feel rushed (unlike some experiences with other competitors). You'll quickly find that the people who work at WBS are open-minded, inclusive, fun and extremely friendly people. Each a personality of their own! They actively care and communicate a lot about creating a safe space for everyone to thrive. You'd be surprised at the stories they have to tell... The whole staff goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable. 🙂 This is especially true of our instructors. Every group of students has a lead instructor and a junior instructor. No matter how packed their schedules may be with other 1:1 meetings with fellow students in your batch, they always make sure you are not left behind. They offer creative solutions for dealing with difficult, unexpected circumstances. They listen to your problems and make sure to solve them one way or another. They are also so much fun that this bootcamp never feels like one. Instead, the batch and our instructors grew together as a group of really good friends. They have become my family for the past 4 months - and the times ahead! 🥰 For the first 1-2 months, the staff will actively solicit weekly feedback in all areas in special group feedback sessions to make sure you are on track and confident in what you are doing. The feedback is evaluated immediately. Whenever there is something to improve, an ""immediate action"" will be written down for everyone to witness. You'll also have regular 1:1 sessions with your Lead Instructor, especially in the beginning. Obviously, these mandatory sessions will decrease in time to make room for more advanced coding topics. But everyone from Community Management to Career Services to Junior to Lead Instructor is always there to listen to you. At the same time, they want you to learn how to code on your own. Here and there, some of us would have liked more guidance on some topics, for example, because of personal or health circumstances - or simply because you have a different opinion about how best to teach certain topics. But after talking to so many people, it's clear that it's impossible to please everyone all the time. When you have people with backgrounds ranging from historian to skydiver to biologist to physicist to marketing manager to computer science professor, you can't make it right for everyone. Every once in a while, it's your turn to take matters into your own hands. It's your turn to develop a lifelong learning mindset - the instructors keep telling you how important this is in the tech industry. And they are absolutely right! It's normal to feel overwhelmed from time to time. But trust yourself, trust your instructors, meet with your group virtually, and keep pushing - you can do it! 💻 As for the curriculum itself, I couldn't be happier! Analyzing the plans of an internationally expanding tech company with SQL and Tableau; cleaning large data sets with Pandas to settle the company's discourse on whether discounts are beneficial or harmful; A/B testing a library's website to improve its usability; engineer a local weather data pipeline with APIs and deploy it on Google Cloud Platform (similar to AWS) for automation; curate and publish Spotify playlists using k-means clustering in unsupervised machine learning; predict real estate prices using unsupervised machine learning; build your own chatbot using generative AI; and last but not least: A final 3-week solo or group project of your choice - dive into deep learning, build a recommender system, offer your services to other companies. ... the possibilities are endless. Consultations ensure that you always end up with a feasible project. And then there is the final 2-week on-campus phase in Berlin. Accommodation and meals cost about 590€. I'll make this quick: if you can get funded, go! If you have to pay yourself: go! Especially in the spring you will have an EPIC time! The campus is right on the river Spree. They offer SUPs, kayaks, table tennis, billard,... FOR FREE! The community managers and all the staff at this beautiful organic hotel are wonderful people. A Michelin-starred chef prepares the most amazing vegetarian food you've probably ever had in your life. Give yourself this treat at the end of a 4-month journey. Network with students from other batches and make lifelong friends with your classmates as you crack on on your final project together. On a financial note: If you live at least 90 minutes from the campus address at Weisskopffstr. 16 (currently NOT the billing address!), the Agentur für Arbeit should pay for your stay. Don't hesitate to send them several messages if they don't reply in time. 💵 However, I would like to point out some areas that could be improved. The bootcamp is advertised with weekly changing group work projects - unfortunately this isn't exactly true. There are some, but many are spread out over the course of 2 weeks, while others are solo work. The catch? Even when you're working alone, you're put into a (virtual) ""group"". While this is supposed to encourage team building, I found little reason to do so - as opposed to the actual group projects, which felt nice and very valuable. I'd like to see more group impulses for these kinds of solo projects. Next, I would like to see more emphasis on integrating Github. Present a sustainable workflow and make sure students stick to it on a regular basis. This would allow them to practice their skills in real-world collaboration scenarios and steadily build their portfolio. WBS also provides career services. I really appreciate the school's efforts to offer 3 dedicated full career days in the curriculum. That way, you can't just skip out on your job search 😉 The recruiters teach you how to write a resume, cover letter, and compelling LinkedIn profile; how to negotiate salary; and how to network. Most importantly, they give you time to actually DO these things! You know how it is: you learn about something, and when the time comes, you want to do it. But then life happens... and you didn't do the thing at all. Fortunately, WBS has you covered! They also encourage routine LinkedIn posts and create a support group to help each other get noticed. What can I say? It works! After another weekly post of mine, I got an interview invitation! 🥳 What I liked most about the career days: the group exercises. This is where you present your new resume or LinkedIn profile to 1-2 randomly selected peers from ALL of the batches, including web development or UI/UX. This allows for diverse and practical feedback with unique perspectives. Don't worry, everything will be reviewed by WBS recruiters as well; plus, you'll receive a personalized, recorded feedback video to improve upon! After the bootcamp, they will continue to support you for another month. The Career Service certainly provides a lot of value for those who haven't spent a lot of time optimizing their applications. However, the knowledge was not always up to date. It was usually presented at a rather slow pace - especially if you're used to the pace of the bootcamp by now. I often felt that I learned more in less time by watching a few videos from renowned career YouTubers like Jeff Su. Finally, they are still building their professional network - some other schools offer more collaborations or partnerships with well-known companies. At least they have some. And every one of them is worth having! 🙂 There are also (optional) weekly invited talks. I've enjoyed most of them very much. Every few weeks there is a Community Demo Day, where you can get a lot of inspiration for your final project from the best graduates of other batches. Last but not least, we got premium access to LinkedIn Learning and CodeAcademy during our bootcamp. So, if you're one of those who blast through the exercises including all bonus content, there's plenty more course material to broaden your horizons and collect some certificates. 🏆 In summary, I would like to reiterate how happy I am to have taken the Data Science Bootcamp at WBS Coding School. While I'm not in agreement with every single aspect all the time, I mostly am. And I am convinced that there is no better competitor on the market. And why is that? Because they don't just talk, they do! They actively gather feedback and get better every day. They learn from every experience and implement feedback immediately. They don't just collect your money and offer the same curriculum for years. No, they are constantly evolving - even during our bootcamp, when a later topic on recommender systems was replaced by one on generative AI and large language models! From then on, recommender systems was simply another bonus material. 😎 WBS Coding School offers an incredible value for your time. Almost everyone I have met during the online course or on campus is a lovely person that I love to hang out with. I am 100% sure your experience will be even better than mine! Take the step you've been afraid to take. And take it at WBS. 💪🏼 Contact me on LinkedIn to learn more! 🙂 All the best! 🤓 Christian",coursereport

2265,WBS coding school,2024-04-19,"Loved every minute of my WBS experience. I highly recommend it. Everything was absolutely perfect about this boot camp: the students, the teachers, the campus phase, the job assistance. The amount of things you learn during the bootcamp can be overwhelming sometimes but it is worth it. I learned all the things one should if one is looking for a career change or is interested in this field. Of course you should not expect to be the best developer in the world after the boot camp but it does give you some very strong basics on how coding works and most importantly on how to learn to code. This means that the real journey starts after the boot camps because the boot camps is just the tip of the iceberg. Overall if you think you could be into coding then just go for it, you will not regret it and also if you have the chance attend the last two weeks on campus. The last two weeks on campus were just pure fun: the energy of teams and the people working at WBS was just amazing and we have also multiplied the learning by 1000% just by being on campus. and big big big THANKS to REAGAN, our instructor who was born to teach the basics of web development.

2266,WBS coding school,2024-03-18,"I strongly recommend this 15-week Data Science Bootcamp. It surpassed my expectations by not only significantly enhancing my data analysis skills, but also enabling me to build my own portfolio and generate new project ideas. The course content is present-day and meticulously organized, enriched with plenty of exercises. The program is designed to introduce a new topic every one to two weeks, challenging students to present their work and demonstrate newly acquired skills. The instructors are exceptionally attentive, providing clear explanations. Throughout the bootcamp, there are opportunities for one-on-one sessions, ensuring that any questions or concerns are addressed with insightful solutions. An integral part of the journey involves engaging in team projects that mirror real-world job scenarios, preparing us effectively for future employment. A highlight for me was the career service offered, which includes revising CVs and LinkedIn profiles, coupled with actionable feedback to expedite job application processes. Additionally, the bootcamp fosters a collaborative environment, offering networking opportunities.

The classes are very well structured and have a mainly practical approach which helps a lot to understand the topics and to be able to apply them quickly. It should be noted that each lesson has ""bonus"" study modules in terms of theory in which everyone can add knowledge, which are usually accompanied by a practical exercise. The level of the instructors is excellent, they answer all the questions as soon as possible and in case there is a question they can't answer, they will find out and come back to you. In between of classes there were ""Career days"" in which we learned how to successfully create a CV as well as how to properly answer to interview questions or to level up the LinkedIn profile in order to be able to find a job as soon as possible. To sum up: I can only recommend this bootcamp and this school.",coursereport

2269,WBS coding school,2024-03-14,"I want to thank the whole WBS team for this amazing experience where I was challenged and pushed beyond my limits by doing something I find interesting as a final project. I started the Bootcamp because I wanted to learn how to code to use it on Blockchain, my idea wasn't to become a blockchain developer but to learn how to use analytical tools that are blockchain-based. Before starting the Bootcamp, I knew the theoretical concepts of blockchain from a marketing perspective and I had some limitations in interacting with some of the analytical tools that currently exist in the market, so starting this Bootcamp helped me to understand better some of these analytical tools and use them from a technical perspective (implementing APIs, using SQL to manage data and build dashboards, etc.). I knew the Bootcamp was not about blockchain, but by learning basic languages like Python and SQL, I am in a better spot than before, especially after building my app. I didn't imagine I would be developing one, but this just shows me how much one can achieve if really interested and dedicated to one specific topic. It can be hard if you don't have a technical background, but your passion and curiosity will play an important role in learning. I would like to thank my instructors, they were there to support me and explain things when I needed it. My colleagues were also making this journey more entertaining by sharing their thoughts and motivation. To everyone reading this review, I would recommend you to join this Boot camp if you are theoretically passionate about a technical topic and you have no coding experience. It will help you a lot.",coursereport

I will review one by one the points that I like and why. Instructors: Our instructor Maria Piquero was amazing she has the patience, the knowledge and everything that is need it so you can understand and apply what its been taught. I have 0 complains tp her she is amazing how instructors and teacher should be in any place. Online: There is not a stopper at all for this Bootcamp to teach you online and improve, it is crazy how we all started and we ended up as professionals. Lessons: It is super dynamic and not boring at all, really well thought the design of the classes to make us learn with workshop so we can apply what was teach on the lesson. On campus: This is the highlight among all of it. All the people is nice, the stuff, the students, instructors and more. It is a priceless experience to go on campus so if you consider to take it, please go!, it is worth it. Good accommodations for you to stay, nice food with even chefs and with a beautiful view of a river in Berlin. You can not ask for more. Price: The price is fair for all that you got, even when you stay on campus it is cheaper that staying in a hotel in Berlin Work search help: They prepare you with your LinkedIn, how to do an interview, how to behave in job interviews, how to post to job and more. This part was the most scare I was of the Bootcamp but if you use every tool you definitely will get a job So overall there is not negative stuff to say, this is a good school for you to get into and I hope this helps.",coursereport

2316,WBS coding school,2023-03-13,"I recently attended WBS coding school, and it was an incredible experience for me. The curriculum is well-developed, allowing students to gradually immerse themselves in the domain of coding. What I found particularly effective was the repetitive usage of tools that allowed me to learn through action. One of the most valuable aspects of the program was the real-life projects that allowed me to apply my creativity while dealing with real problems. This helped me to see the importance of what I was learning and prepared me not only technically but also mentally for the working environment. I also appreciated the 24/7 teachers and community support that were always there to help me out whenever I had a question or concern. Working in small groups also helped me to develop my ability to work in a team. The school provides job support through career workshops, which is great for transitioning into the workforce. However, I would have appreciated having some psychology support as well, as the intensity and workload were sometimes overwhelming. Additionally, tangible job support such as internships in partner companies would have been a great addition to the program. Overall, my experience at WBS coding school was fantastic. I felt right at home thanks to the manager, Miguel, and the rest of the awesome WBS team, including Patrick Rothe and chef Duschko.

2317,WBS coding school,2023-02-12,"A life-changing experience it has been, reminding me of how steep my learning curve can be and how much I can actually accomplish in a short amount of time. The push and motivation not only came from the carefully-picked material that is taught and the amount of it, but also from the structure of the course and the environment it was being taught in. The bootcamp definitely exceeded all expectations I had. It was challenging, but the goal never seemed unachievable. It re-shaped my thinking, making me more solution-oriented and gave me belief that with the right mindset anything can be achieved. The pace can be quite intense at times, but the community one becomes part of when joining WBS Coding School makes sure that it never becomes overwhelming. The new concepts I was learning every day sure kept me on my toes and kept pulling me back for more. I could see how much effort has been put in designing the course, which is constantly being improved through student feedback. I picked this Data Science bootcamp in large part because it is project-oriented and not exam-oriented. One really gets a feel of what it would be like to work in the industry and by the end feel prepared to enter the market, with a portfolio of diverse projects to show for. The instructors were friendly, supportive, helpful, dedicated, driven, knowledgeable and professional. The combined work of the instructors and all other staff, such as Community Services and Career Services, created a safe, inclusive and reliable atmosphere where one could grow intellectually and emotionally. Communication was always easy, fast and friendly. The hybrid nature of the bootcamp also impressed me. The first 12 weeks were online, whereby we had contact time with our instructors every single day. At no point did I feel alone in front of my computer. The last 3 weeks, which is the project phase, can be done on campus in Berlin if one chooses to. Meaningful relationships built with my classmates and instructor were definitely solidified during these 3 weeks we spent in person together. I only have good things to say about my time at WBS Coding School and would highly recommend this bootcamp, which I wish didn't end after 15 weeks.",coursereport

One think that I did not like though was the policy of 2 education vouchers for the final project and the campus . Since the final project and on-campus learning is the most important part of the course, they should have found a way to include both parts in the first voucher instead of requiring unemployed people to pay 800 euros up front and then try to reclaim from AfA the 650 euros.",coursereport

I have definitely seen immense progress in my work from non-designer to Product designer. This course is crafted so amazing from scratch lessons to practice sessions to final presentations. Not only this, the course helps in building our soft skills, Resumes, Linked profiles, and even preparing for interviews. On top of it our instructors are so good and supportive.

2322,WBS coding school,2023-01-18,"WBS delivered on what it promised. The 15 weeks gave me an intense learning curve through Data Science, starting from major Python libraries like pandas and scikit-learn, through Jupyter notebooks, database handling via SQL and machine learning techniques such as clustering, classification and regressions, a wide spectrum was covered. The material was very well put together. The LMS was well structured and some lessons were borrowed from Codecademy Pro as well as LinkedIn. The teaching team handled feedback well in the spirit of continuous improvement. The teaching of data science was complemented with various sessions on job search, writing resumes and applications, building up your profile on LinkedIn and how to interview with prospective employers. The pace of the course was challenging at the beginning, after all it is a bootcamp. However, there were lots of well detailed instructions to catch up. I liked it a lot that there were optional challenges and material to discover for self studies. That way every participant could build up from their already existing knowledge. Over time expectations shifted to mostly figure things out by yourself. This left me with a solid sense of what I can now do on my own. The ""learning by doing"" culminated in a 3 week final project (optionally on campus). My final project was ""Generating a topical map for a niche website."" I ended up with a solid result, which I'll test on a real website in the coming months. The best part of the bootcamp was our teaching staff. Our lead teacher treated us as adults and allowed us to push as hard as we could into any direction. He patiently helped us through problems of understanding and went the extra mile to research issues he had not seen before. At the same time he fostered a lot of collaboration and team spirit. There were no negatives for me along the way. I wish I could extend the camp for another 4 weeks. If you are looking for hands-on training in data science and have 15 weeks of time, I can highly recommend the WBS bootcamp.",coursereport
2323,WBS coding school,2023-01-05,"Right in front I want to say something on my overall experience: I'm so happy I chose WBS Coding School to help me make the transition in the field of data. Not once during this heavy load bootcamp I had the feeling to be in the wrong place or that this was not what I wanted, quite the opposite. I felt challenged and at the same time empowered and self-confident about all the new stuff we were learning and applying and I really was looking forward to (almost ) every learning session we had. And this whole experience was a result of all the smaller parts that contributed to this experience. The curriculum and its structure, learning resources, projects and its difficulty. Our instructor/teacher and the teaching style. The classmates and the interaction, the learning athmosphere. The staff. The career support. Curriculum and teaching approach: The project-based and hands-on teaching method is very good and I think the only way to deliver all the skills and techniques and concepts in a feasible and time effective way. I was always surprised how much we were able to do in a comparable short time frame of some weeks, like putting together a machine learning model for the first time, without understanding every detail of it but not without having a good understanding of the overall concepts. I found the learning material to be very very good. I don't have the comparison with other bootcamps, but I really think that the people who put together the course really understand what it needs to learn something new in a fast and effective way without getting stuck in details. One of the main reasons why this bootcamp was such a success for me, was, that it prestructured my learning roadmap. I didn't have to care about what I have to learn in which order and how deep my knowledge have to be in Python, in SQL, or which projects I should conduct. They did this already for me. And they really do a great job. Teacher/Instructor and learning athmosphere: I can't talk for all of the instructors but I believe that the school favours instructors/teachers that have a thrill for teaching and learning and show dedication for their subject. What really contributed to a good learning athmosphere in all of our sessions we took together as a learning group was, that nobody wanted to show off or something like that. Everybody wanted to learn something and ask questions, everybody was very supportive in helping each other, everybody respected each other and our instructor assisted all of this asking, being curious and supportive behavior. Learning in a group can be both, really inspiring and comforting, but also annoying sometimes. For me it was definitely both. The level of difficulty: This is hard to say, actually. I did make the experience that those students that don't have any background in data or coding have to put in more effort than students with some preknowledge. Some of us really got pushed to their personal limits. But nobody got lost completely because our instructor really showed some good patience in revising, explaining again and again. And there is help if you need: Staff and (Career)Support: Even though I personally didn't have to make use of it a lot, I can say for sure that a lot of the energy in this school goes into forming a supporting net for all the students. You won't only have your instructor to ask questions, they also have junior instructors, mentors and several channels in the chat where you can discuss things and ask questions. And everybody is really eager to help. The sruples to ask for help if you need it are extremely low. If you ever get overstressed there are people who talk to you in person and take their time, go through the code with again etc. Also the Career Service is really a big asset of this School. They got a Career Program you can work through and get personal feedback on CV, LinkedIn Profile and Cover Letter. Also you get get in touch with the Career Support in personal. The information and feedback I got was very very helpful for me. Downsides: - In the part-time course there is no individual final project you can work on your own or in a team for some weeks like in the full-time course. Your portfolio at the end of the bootcamp consists of all the projects you did during the bootcamp. Those are prescribed by the curriculum though and leave not so much room for individual experimentation I would say. - Also no stay at the campus is provided for the part-time course. Which makes sense because the reason why people chose part-time courses are also the reasons because they can't just go to Berlin for three weeks in a row. But still, I got the feeling that we missed something there, because the campus looks great, getting to know all the classmates in person would and meeting the staff would also have been great. - Group work when no need for it: In a bootcamp there is limited time for everything. In my opinion the focus of a bootcamp cannot be to teach and learn working in groups. I know that this is an important skill. But I shouldn't have to learn it in the bootcamp, because the time is limited. When group works helps to finish a complex project in a limited time than yes, go for it. But I definitely feel that we lost a lot of time talking through the same things over and over again. Sometimes It felt like all the bad group work I've done at school. But I don't think that this reflects all of the data science bootcamps. I think this was a special case of our group and my personal perspective on it. Because not everybody thought like that. - One or maybe two of the sections we worked through seemed to be still work in progress. The learning notebooks were not aligned with the other learning material on the learning platform and not just once there was some confusion about the instructions on the learning platfrorm.",coursereport

2326,WBS coding school,2022-09-22,"I attended the Web Development Bootcamp from May to September, and I learned much more than coding during 15 weeks. My experience at WBS Coding School was extremely positive. I was very impressed with Instructors knowledge, with their way of teaching and how the course was correctly structured and timely measured. After working in construction management for 3 years, I decided to do something that I always wanted to do. I felt in need of guidance throughout the process. Thankfully, my advisor at the Federal Employment Agency pointed WBS Coding School to me. I spent some time researching before I made my school choice. One of the biggest reasons I chose WBS was its duration. While the other bootcamps were about 9 weeks, in WBS this was 15 weeks with the campus phase in Berlin for the last 3 weeks to finish your final project. During your time on campus, WBS allows you to focus solely on your final project. A room of your own, great workspace, 3 meals a day, rest, and entertainment areas, etc. It started 2 weeks before with the Primer period, which was the preparatory stage before the Bootcamp. During those 2 weeks I had the chance to learn the basic principles of the topic. I saw the benefit of this many times during Bootcamp. Lessons are online from 09:00 to 18:00 and thanks to experienced instructors very effective. Also, there are one-on-one lessons on every Wednesdays with your lead instructor. Also, the Jr. Instructors are always ready to help with any problem. In these private lessons, I had the opportunity to repeat the subjects that I was stuck on or had difficulty understanding. Another good thing was that we had weekly group projects to improve our coding and collaboration skills. At the end of each week, we had to present our projects. Apart from WBS Coding School’s learning platform, which is already very rich and correctly structured, they provided me with a pro account on Codecademy and LinkedIn learning. Furthermore, the Career Support Team’s meetings and feedback were very special. The most enjoyable part of this journey was for me to meet these amazing people. I had the chance of having amazing classmates from different cultural and academic backgrounds. We did not only support each other, but also formed a very good friendship going forward!",coursereport

I've never had previous experience with programming before and I must say that these guys know what they're doing. To real beginner students, the challenge of keeping motivated along the course is gigantic, sometimes almost impossible even, but the community managers, teachers, and Jr instructors are simply wonderful with empathy, and will support you all the way until you're ready to shine again. I can only guarantee that they will try 100% of their effort to make your life easier during this exhaustive training. Not mentioning the quality of the lectures. As a former teacher, I keep high standards on evaluating someone else's teaching skills, and it's beautiful to see your teacher becoming the best version of themselves with you. If you're looking for a place to be yourself and work hard, there's no better choice for you. Work hard, cry, get better, make friends, enjoy the community and CODE.

When I started the course, I barely understood anything beyond basic HTML, yet 4 months later, I'm ready to enter the job market. I would definitely recommend WBS Coding School as they have the most up-to-date curriculum, and because they teach a popular stack (MERN), which will easily get you hired. Along with the Career-Services offered, the vast amount of group coding projects will prepare you to enter the industry, especially when you come from a non-coding background. The support from the staff & junior instructors was the highlight of the course. To have people that are truly invested in you is what really sets this school apart. You're not just some number getting churned out en masse from some type of learning factory. Even after graduation, the staff support & community has been so encouraging. I am proud to be part of the WBS family. I would like to particularly thank my amazing instructor Yacine, for his unwavering dedication to his students, for always responding to my questions no matter how ridiculous the time, and for his patience & humor.

I can say, it was the right decision to join this course provided by WBS Coding School, considering the curriculum, staff, accessibility of the learning material, career services - assisting you to become a professional participant of the job-search market and especially because of the instructor, who was there for me whenever I needed and had a special ability of the person who can teach. The course itself is quite intense, which is normal for a Bootcamp, you learn a lot of hard skills but one is also expected to invest a lot of time in order to successfully gain knowledge from it. The entire course, I had a feeling of a rollercoaster and was quite concerned about the knowledge I could absorb, but upon completing my own final project, I realized how far I am standing from the starting point. In the end, I just want to mention, completing any Bootcamp, you will be far away from calling yourself a ""Data Scientist"", and it is incomparable to any educational degree. But if you don't have any possibility to join a university to get a degree or want to make a huge step towards becoming a data scientist, I can confidently recommend WBS Coding School with all its advantages - as the best available option.

The content was up-to-date and Julia was very kind, patient and professional. It's crucial to keep in mind that we learned how to learn, how to do research about a topic, how to ask questions and how to approach and solve problems.

If you are looking for a place where you can learn loads of up to date technique, I would say come to WBS. My instructor Jorge was just the best. He got all the merits a good instructor has. He is very knowledgable, not only knowing how to get things work, he also knows how to explain it in simple plain language that everybody can understand. He is very patient, he answered every question without showing any negative emotion even if I had asked him the same question many times. The most impressive thing was that he always gave me the exact answer with no doubt. Plus he is funny and very kind. The whole team is very helpful, they make you feel like really in a community, they are there to help not only from what you need, also from their experience.

I took part in the 15 Weeks Full Time bootcamp from February 2021 to June 2021. It was an Overall great experience, it certainly has it's pros and cons as i imagine any bootcamp does but for the sake of this review i'll concentrate on the pros. First and foremost the Instructor, we had the pleasure of having in my opinion one of the Best instructors in Fey, and for the first week the Lead of the Bootcamp Alexis who is incredible in his way of teaching. Fey's way of teaching us new techs is unparalleled though with the additional bonus that we could also focus on learning on our own. The pace of the bootcamp is hasty in a good way. Yes it is a very demanding program and you will wonder sometimes ""why did i join this"" especially if you've got not previous experience in Web Dev, but it prepares you for the job market as best as a 3 Month program can. The Curriculum is up to date, but i would like it better if we've had a greater focus on React, again this is not the general thinking it's more of a personal note. The rest of the team was Friendly yet Professional which i find an excellent combination. More detailed Mareike was the first person i've spoken in the Bootcamp is in charge of making sure that our integration to the bootcamp was as smooth as it could be. Janina in the HR is great and always a friendly person to talk to. Last but not least Erika and Caro are in charge of making sure what you know and learned in the Bootcamp translates nicely into the Job Market and they will help you out in your search for a job.",coursereport

The team of the school is very supporting (from the juniors instructors that are wonderful and super helping to the career advisor). The curriculum of the course is really good if you want to be a full stack web developer with the latest programming languages. The instructor is active listening to everyone's needs and if you have any problem or you feel even a little bit stack just say it and he will take the time to re-explain anything. My advise during the course is to trust the process: I felt myself completely lost at one point but exactly how the instructor kept repeating at one point everything comes together and you fully understand everything.",coursereport
2354,WBS coding school,2021-05-05,"Due to the fact I also tried to find out more about the different Bootcamps here, in order to make the right decision where i should register i would like to give you a short summary about my experience with WBS CODING SCHOOL i made during the FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPER Course from Jan - April 2021. The curriculum and the tech stack we learned was UP TO DATE and well prepared.FRONTEND:HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, REACTBACKEND:Node.js, Express.js,DATABASE:PostgreSQL (SQL)MongoDB(NoSQL)TOOLS:GIT,NPM,GitHub,Travis CI.. We started from the beginning very practice-oriented.Of course the tempo is pretty fast, but i knew that from the beginning - It´s a Bootcamp - and we get help whenever needed from the Jr.Instructors or the great community.Nevertheless i recommend to do the Primer (Preparation path) before very carefully.We get a lot of “best-practice” Tips from our experienced Instructor Ben and once a week we had a one on one with him where he can respond to each one individually…I also enjoyed the Team Projects every 2 week where we have practiced to work in a team with the latest Technologies GitHub,LiveShare etc. In total i felt very comfortable from the start to the end everything was settled perfectly….Workshops,Career service,different online events (Hackathons)..and the Community Manager Janina always offered her help in any cases. I can highly recommend the FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPER course !!!",coursereport
2355,WBS coding school,2021-03-17,"I highly recommend this course since it teaches you everything you need to land your first job as a web developer. It teaches tools and technologies that are relevant today and is very practice-oriented. From the beginning, we worked on one or two-week group projects that we could already use to build up our portfolio. Besides teaching the technical content, our experienced trainer gave us very valuable insights into the actual work as a developer. Paired with the provided career service, I felt very well prepared for job applications and interviews. Having previous (basic) knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript or any other programming language certainly helps to keep up with the fast learning speed and to maybe take even more out of this course. But don’t worry if you take this course with zero previous knowledge - it starts by teaching you all the basics and builds up on them as the course goes further.",coursereport

2357,WBS coding school,2021-03-10,"The Experience from the WBS Coding School was amazing in two ways: personal development and developing astonishing technical skills. Personal: you have a class between 9 and 15 people, in the intense time you will find a lot of friends and it's brings people together as like back in the school. So you are not alone in this phase, have anytime somebody to talk to about as well from the staff. Technical Skills: In this short time you get a lot of information and new languages to learn from. You should be prepared that a typical 9-6 day can't be really efficient. A bit more extra time should be contributed and planned to finish the course. It's for your own good. Overall this program is a tense experience and brings you beyond your expectations in a positive way.",coursereport
2358,WBS coding school,2021-02-26,"My overall experience at WBS Coding School was great and I would recommend this course to other aspiring web developers out there. I entered this course as a complete beginner, not even knowing what a terminal was or what the difference between backend and frontend development is. In retrospect I feel that this was not the best thing as it made my first month very stressful and I even cried after the first week. I was lucky enough to be working in a great group at that time and they helped me through it and reminded me that the start is scary for everyone but if you persevere and get over the initial bump, coding will start to make sense. My instructor during the course was great and I really liked his explanation of the course material. I also really liked the fact that the lectures were recorded so I could always go over them at a later time. This was great for me as, since I was such a beginner, I needed to watch some of the lectures again to fully process what what going on. The only problem with my time there was that the group I was in was really big which I don’t think works for this type of learning. However, once we complained, WBS listened to us and got another part-time instructor on board. This was such a relief for a beginner like me because I really needed the extra help and attention and the instructor that helped was also great at explaining and very supportive. The career counselling was also a nice touch as it helped me adapt my CV to meet German standards and improve my presence on LinkedIn. I would also recommend that people new to coding should do their final project in a group. I did my final project with one other person and I feel that this made the quality of the project and the whole experience of doing it much better. My time in Berlin was also great as it was nice to meet the people I had been working with for the past months in person and I now feel that I have a small group of people to lean on when times get tough. Having connections in this industry is so important and I think that meeting up with everyone and getting to know them in person was a great added touch to this course. Having this support made the job hunt so much better and less lonely and my group now has their own channel on Discord where we share resources and meet up once in a while. I was very fortunate to have found a job as a frontend developer two months after the course and I feel that the course material prepared me for the role I will be doing.",coursereport
2359,WBS coding school,2021-02-16,"Hi ! I am Aleksandar, a senior digital media designer striving to become the whole package ( growth product designer ). This path is quite long and one of the key expertise I was missing was experience and knowledge in Web Development. After careful consideration I decided to sign up for the Full-stack Web & App development program at WBS Coding School and all I can say it was just the right decision. The curriculum is nicely structured and built for people with different backgrounds. You will never feel left behind and if you do, the the extra set of hands ( junior instructors and school staff ) will help you get back on track. Regarding the content, we studied the latest tech in Frontend ( Html, Css, Js, React ) and Backend ( NodeJS, Express + DB).

2360,WBS coding school,2021-02-05,I am not a tech guy and I probably won't turn into one. Nonetheless I was highly interested in learning to code for several years. Last year I decided to turn that wish into reality by taking the Full-Stack Web & App Developer course of WBS CODING SCHOOL. The course was highly demanding - as expected. It is called Coding Bootcamp for a reason. While you are learning it is hard to recognize what improvements you are actually making. But seeing my final project and compare that to my zero skills from the beginning ... I made a giant leap within these four month thanks to the awesome mentor and the whole team of the WBS CODING SCHOOL.,coursereport
2361,WBS coding school,2021-02-04,"WBS Coding School’s 15-week hybrid bootcamp isn’t just a course that teaches you to write some web apps. Sure, you will acquire numerous new technical skills and industry knowledge but on top of that the whole program unfolds in a fantastic community of motivated and competent instructors and staff, inspiring guest speakers and peers who might become good friends. All that makes this bootcamp both an extremely efficient way to get a solid foundation in full-stack web and app development and a great experience you don’t want to miss. Starting with a review of the basics you are expected to study in the primer course, you will first work on some smaller plain HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript exercises and projects and train your Git and GitHub chops in the command line. But the speed quickly ramps up when React.js is introduced around week 3-4 and then there is another considerable acceleration moment when you’ll transition into the backend side of web development with Node.js and Express. At least that is how it felt to me. Most likely, there will be times when you are going to struggle to keep up with the pace and as far as I can tell, this is the same for every bootcamp style of program. Knowing that you really want to learn these skills and being determined, will help you to overcome the hurdles some concepts or technologies might pose at first. But aside from your own motivation and persistence, being able to ask your instructor, the junior instructors, the mentors or simply the community support channel for help in such situations is of tremendous value and oftentimes you might even find yourself in the pleasant position to help your peers out with the troubles they might be facing. This contributes to the cohesion and solidarity that builds in your group over time. This is further increased by the fact that you are continuously working in small teams that are reshuffled every one or two (sometime even three) weeks to work on group projects. This can be challenging at times, but it is a realistic simulation of the conditions you will most likely find yourself in after graduation. And even such challenging moments might offer you opportunities to practice such extremely important abilities as empathy and patience and maybe even a chance to connect with your peers on a deeper level **and** become more productive as a team. Also, take advantage of the excellent career services WBS Coding School offers you in the form of regular guest speakers and Q&A sessions with people in the industry as well as personal consultations and fine tuning of your profile, strategy and application documents. As with everything in this world, there is room for improvement and to give the team due credit for it, they are working on it. One thing that might directly affect your planning in case you want to take the plunge and enrol for this program: Don’t take the estimated time for preparation too serious. I think it is (or was) tremendously understated with 20-40 hours. Give yourself enough time to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript during the primer phase or, better even, before that (maybe go to Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp or the MDN tutorials and finish the intro-modules). As one of my peers and new friends remarked in her review:I promise you this extra-effort won’t be in vain. You will learn incredibly much either way, but going in with a solid foundation [allows you] to really focus on some more advanced topics and in general [helps in] not being completely overwhelmed 24/7, which is not a state of mind that lets you learn and really manifest knowledge in the long run in my opinion. (https://www.coursereport.com/schools/wbs-coding-school?shared_review=31184#reviews). And speaking about the effort and time you should expect to invest during the primer phase, be prepared to put in a lot of extra hours during the whole program. It obviously depends on your familiarity with the technologies, but if you are not pretty experienced already or just extraordinarily quick in picking up new concepts and skills, keeping up will demand a lot of work in the nights and weekends which is not an option for everyone. During my time at WBS Coding School, a typical work-week had a good 60 hours of focused work. Maybe the numbers turn out to be different for you, but I think it is important to be aware of the time and effort you need to commit for a productive outcome. You should, therefore, honestly ask yourself and your social environment whether you can maintain this kind of energy for a prolonged period of time. If you think you can do that, great! It could still be a good idea to prepare yourself in advance by slowly increasing the amount of time you study and work on code each day during the primer phase like you would prepare yourself for participating in a marathon – which actually is an analogy drawn by our instructor at the start of the course to emphasize the importance of breaks. Overall, I think the whole WBS Coding School team did a great job in creating this program. It offers you an extremely dense and organized way to learn state of the art technologies in a warm and welcoming community. So, if you are searching for a coding bootcamp that offers you all that, WBS Coding School should be at the top of your list.",coursereport
2362,WBS coding school,2021-01-12,"The course was overall well rounded, clear and a lot of information to take.

I learned a lot and gained so many tools to continue this journey on my own. Mind you I am still learning, which is something people should have in consideration before staring this course. As some people entered the course expecting to get all the answers before hand and be fully experts at the end of it. They can, and they will, teach you the language, but can only do so much as to provide you with tools and the support to learn it. You should know that at the end of the course there is still a lot for you to do, but you will have the know-how. Additionally, if you are a newbie like I was, you most definitely will need more than the 40hours per week of the course. Nevertheless, I loved the whole experience as it helped me to discover a love for coding I didn't know I have! My only Con- the group of 17 was too large for just one person and a part-time assistant. However, they took this advice and added more support to the courses after mine.",coursereport
2363,WBS coding school,2021-01-07,"There are plenty of bootcamps these days, and curriculum-wise they more or less offer the same; so you might think at this point of your research: Why not go to Ironhack or LeWagon and just get it over with in 9 instead of 15 weeks, I will get the exact same thing in less time and potentially find a job sooner, right? Let me tell you why: Because you won’t. The curriculum at WBS Coding School is not only very carefully crafted to reflect industry needs and current trends, it also stimulates deep learning by giving you some time to reinforce concepts other bootcamps merely brush over, expecting you to just wing it or force you to work overtime at ridiculous hours - trust me, you need sleep & rest if you want to be able to recall that stuff not only 3 days, but ideally 3 years later. Here, you are not just quickly introduced to something once and then move on to a new area a couple of hours later, you will have multiple exercises that slowly build up on each other and let you constantly revisit and practise previously learned material. And when I say “slowly”, I still mean this in a bootcampy sense of the word, but not at the speed of light as is so common for many of the more fast food-ish contenders out there. Apart from the excellent learning material, the staff is also extraordinary. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming from the get-go, at no point does the experience feel like you’re getting piped through some soulless web dev factory - the teachers are knowledgable and engaged, the community manager and career service advisor make sure you have everything you need: They are always open towards criticism and try to cater to your needs wherever possible; and also set you up for the time after the bootcamp with many helpful resources and workshops that provide guidance for the job search. There is also a huge emphasis on community building, with regular guest speaker events vividly attended by students and alumni alike and a discord server with an active “help” channel you can use during and after the course. Regarding campus time, this will clearly be a highlight during non-pandemic times. Unfortunately I could not afford to stay during the whole time (Jobcenter does not account for the stay if you are a Berlin resident), but spent a couple of nights there and was allowed to attend the rest of the campus phase remotely as I wasn’t comfortable with commuting each day due to the Covid situation. The campus is amazing; and you’ll be sleeping in a very cute private room where you can also work comfortably whenever you feel like you need a bit more you-time during your final project. The whole vibe is very “summer campy” in the best sense of the word, as there are numerous entertainment mediums like table soccer, pool and console games available, not to mention having the Spreeufer directly on your doorstep. If you plan on defeating your instructor in Mario Kart to make up for them constantly defeating you in programming, you might want to brush up on these skills a little bit tho - unfortunately they are great at gaming too! I honestly cannot think of any downsides in regards of the actual “product” you get, but there is one thing that could still be improved in my opinion: With the tech industry still lacking diversity and at times even being a hostile space for women and non-binary people, I really think WBS Coding School should set an example and do a bit better concerning their hiring policy. As of right now, the dev team consists - apart from one really awesome female instructor - solely of male developers. It would be an important message towards students to try and actively change these numbers, giving a chance and a voice to those who have suffered from systemic oppression for so long. I for one, as a woman, would have loved getting insight and mentoring from a more experienced female engineer - never underestimate the power of visibility for inspiring and encouraging others! [On a more general note: I know all those bootcamps are advertised for beginners, and it’s also tempting to believe that with the amount of money one has to disburse, you simply will get a career handed back to you at the end. Well, yes and no. Don’t get me wrong, there ARE people that without much or even zero previous knowledge strive in these environments and just “get it” super quickly. But from my experience, those are to be considered unicorns, or at least something you don’t see every day, let’s say a very pretty horse. So please do yourself a favour and get some of the basics out of the way BEFORE you start a bootcamp: GET DECENT IN JAVASCRIPT BEFORE YOUR FIRST DAY. You obviously don’t have to be in expert going in there, but make sure you can write a for loop without looking up the syntax. Do some basic tutorials, do some research on MDN, and actually go and solidify this knowledge by doing some katas on codewars or eadabit. I promise you this extra-effort won’t be in vain. You will learn incredibly much either way, but going in with a solid foundation made me able to really focus on some more advanced topics and in general not being completely overwhelmed 24/7, which is not a state of mind that lets you learn and really manifest knowledge in the long run in my opinion.]",coursereport
2364,WBS coding school,2021-01-05,"[1] online, and also in-person At first, I haven't considered the online coding boot camp option, but now I think it was the best option I made. The whole package what WBS Coding School offers is quite wholesome. Being 100% online, but still from the application process to graduation, what I have experienced was how 'in-person' it has been. I know it sounds paradoxical, but I have never experienced this genuine personal care at any other institute. [2] great curriculum, great instructor, great staff I started from scratch and they made me build a working full-stack web app in 15 weeks. The curriculum is evolving based on market-trends and the cohort's needs and levels. Every time I hit a brick wall, my instructor, cohort, and the staff helped me out of it. So lucky to have them. [3] career service The curriculum includes career service. It was hard to manage to update my CV or LinkedIn profiles in parallel with building the project, but now I know, it is also a part of training bc it is a slice of our daily life in the very near future. Besides, the famous Friday TALK session with tech companies, recruiters, alumni, or ppl in the industry has given me insight, inspiration, and motivation. [4] sustainability and warm-hearted community As an alumnus, I need to stand alone, but I get still 'ping' from the school for inviting the TALK session. And still, as a familiar community, we support each other intra-cohort and also cross-cohort. [5] Overall After all, it is/was a coding ""boot camp"", but it was also a precious experience. I wish I could write more, but my code is waiting :) Happy learning, happy coding!!!",coursereport

And it was no problem at all to do that because of our great instructor, who was always very supportive. Within the 12 weeks at home we went through a lot of subjects, basics and advanced stuff and had several solo-/group-projects. The last 3 weeks at the WBS campus in Berlin where fantastic. You get to finally meet the people in person and work on the big last project. I am glad for that experience. We now are definitely ready to enter the industry.",coursereport

Our teacher was amazing, the campus time in Berlin was great and the staff is very supportive. The downside is what i wrote earlier, it is very challenging, so be prepared to get stressed.

I came in with some foundational knowledge, but I’m leaving with a completely new level of confidence and a powerful toolkit of skills that I never imagined mastering in such a short time. Over the course of the bootcamp, I was able to deepen my understanding of Python and SQL—tools I had used before, but now feel truly comfortable applying in a real-world, analytical context. But what really blew me away was diving into topics that were completely new to me. A/B testing, Machine Learning, and Generative AI sounded intimidating at first, but the way the material was taught made these advanced concepts not only approachable but also exciting. Imagine going from zero experience to actually building your own predictive model and even a chatbot using generative AI—that’s exactly what I did! This wasn’t just a learning experience—it was a transformation. I’m incredibly proud of what I’ve achieved and grateful for the guidance, structure, and support throughout the bootcamp.

2371,WBS coding school,2025-04-10,"I enrolled in the full-stack web development bootcamp at WBS Coding School with high expectations, based on the promotional materials that promised 396 hours of live, instructor-led instruction, personalized support, and the ability to tailor the learning experience.Unfortunately, my experience has been far from what was advertised.Here are the key issues I encountered: Live Instruction Time Severely Lacking: Although the schedule suggests several hours of live teaching per week, in reality, each session often includes only 30–50 minutes of instructor-led explanation, with the remaining time dedicated to self-study. This is not what was promised under “live, instructor-led sessions.” Self-Learning as the Default, Not the Supplement: While independent learning is important in any tech field, it was effectively the primary method here. Complex topics were introduced with minimal explanation, and students were left to navigate dense, confusing materials on their own. Disorganized and Inaccessible Learning Platform: The online platform was difficult to follow, poorly structured, and not inclusive for different learning styles. Despite raising this concern multiple times, no improvements or support were offered. No Real Customization or Personal Support: Promotional claims of personalized guidance were not reflected in my experience. Reaching out to instructors and staff with concerns yielded vague encouragements rather than real support or adaptation to my learning needs. No Accountability When Issues Were Raised: I submitted a formal complaint outlining all of the above. The school denied any wrongdoing and closed the complaint without offering a solution, despite extensive evidence. I’m sharing this review not out of frustration, but to help others make an informed decision. If you’re looking for a bootcamp with consistent live instruction, hands-on guidance, and clear learning pathways, I strongly recommend you explore other options.",coursereport

2438,WBS coding school,2024-01-21,"WBS CODING SCHOOL // Data Science Bootcamp I participated in the 4-month-long Data Science Bootcamp. Overall, it was a great learning experience that solidified my Python knowledge, taught me SQL basics and a variety of data new data analysis techniques. -Summary- + great for newbies and people with some prior experience alike + good teachers, live lectures, very good online learning material + learn meaningful and up-to-date data science skills + Campus Phase rocks + very helpful WBS staff - many teachers don't have tech industry background - no tight networking opportunities within the tech industry -Previous Knowledge- I have a PhD in marine science and had quite a bit of previous experience in statistical programming with R as well as a little bit of Python experience. Therefore, the first couple of weeks were rather slow for me. However, after roughly 4-5 weeks, the pace started picking up and I felt thoroughly challenged. -Curriculum- The curriculum is project-based and hands-on, which is the right way of learning for me. You start a new project every 1-3 weeks. There are live lectures and coding lessons. We covered basic data analysis and visualization with Python and SQL, Cloud computing and data pipelines, web scraping and API calls, A/B Testing, Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning (Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, etc.) and Recommender Systems. The only thing that was missing in the curriculum, in my opinion, was Deep Learning. The last 2.5 weeks are spent on a final project, either alone or in groups of 2-3 people. -Daily Learning- On a regular day, you would have some read-through material on the Online Learning Platform, followed by one or two lecture/coding sessions. The rest of the day is used for project work. By the end of the project, you usually present your work to the class. Students organize themselves during their projects. They can work together in Discord channels, or separately. They can use Github for collaborating or whichever other tool to facilitate exchange. How much you enjoy the learning journey depends a lot on your class mates and the group dynamic. -Campus Phase- Students can come to the WBS Campus to work on their final project (~1h South-East of Berlin Mitte). This has been the most fun part for me - I would recommend anyone to go if you have the chance. The bill is ~600,-€ for 11 nights of accommodation and 3 veggie meals per day. You can either pay it yourself or have it covered by the job center. -WBS Support- I've experienced the WBS CODING SCHOOL employees to be very helpful when it comes to organizing stuff. The job center had first declined my application for the campus phase. Together with the WBS staff, however, we were able to convince them to fund me. -Teachers' Expertise- The instructors I've had lessons with during the bootcamp were all knowledgable in the course material. They were also good at teaching and approachable, with some very few exceptions. However, they are certainly not all experts from the data science industry. The WBS website mislead me on this one, as many (perhaps most) instructors do in fact not have industry experience. That doesn't make them bad teachers, but it still put me off, as I'd expected industry expertise. -Career Opportunities- There is a Career Service that offers online learning material, three mandatory daily workshops throughout the bootcamp, a CV, CL and LinkedIn screening and a one-time career advice session. The workshops helped me a lot to brush up my profile. The only thing I'm missing is - again - a tighter connection to the industry. There are guest talks by people working in tech, but that's pretty much it. I would appreciate it if the final projects were presented not only to WBS peers, but also company representatives. This would encourage networking and job finding for graduates. Many thanks to the WBS CODING SCHOOL. Keep up the good work!",coursereport

2442,WBS coding school,2024-01-17,"I recently completed a coding bootcamp, and overall, my experience has been positive and transformative. Going from basic HTML and minimal CSS knowledge to confidently creating projects with a MERN tech stack is an achievement I'm proud of. However, there are a few aspects of the bootcamp that I believe could be improved. One significant factor influencing the overall experience is the instructor. The bootcamp's success seems to hinge heavily on who your instructor is and how they structure their classes. Unfortunately, there isn't a consistent quality management system in place to ensure uniform teaching methods for all students. This lack of standardization occasionally led to variations in the learning experience. One notable aspect is the emphasis on independent learning. While empowering students to research solutions and navigate documentation is crucial, I sometimes felt we spent too much time working alone. A more balanced approach, incorporating additional group activities or instructor-led sessions, would have enhanced the collaborative aspect of the learning process. Moreover, the promises made by the bootcamp regarding job market prospects felt somewhat exaggerated in real-life scenarios. While I appreciate the effort put into organizing three career days focused on CVs and job applications, the actual job placement outcomes might be very different then promised. But this remains to be seen. Despite these concerns, I want to highlight the positive impact the bootcamp had on my skill set and project portfolio. The MERN stack projects I've created showcase my newfound abilities and give me confidence in my coding capabilities. The staff and the instructors all seem to be passionate about teaching and want you to succeed, which I found very motivating.",coursereport

I told the admission officer that I had struggled with burnout periods for quite a few years and asked, if that would be a problem and was told, It wouldn´t be. He told me, that the WBS had Community Managers who helped in times of overwhelm. So I started and was overwhelmed pretty quickly. It turned out that the bootcamp was very triggering for my burnout tendencies and it was not possible, to slow down/change the class/change the model or anything else. The community managers were very nice and very unhelpful. I had to push through or give up. I was very disappointed but pushed through which was not good for my mental health. The content of the bootcamp is a good starting point for someone who wants to get a job as a coder but I felt completely left alone with everything else. The very praised career service really was a joke. The advice I got was so basic and not helpful which was a pity as the career service was such a big selling point for me to choose this bootcamp.

Thanks to instructors who put a lot of effort into making things assimilate in our brains. The daily morning standups and evening checkout ensured that we were still on the right track. I started the course with very little coding experience, but I expected to get hands-on experience with real data, and I am glad that this course was the right choice. Our instructors were always available for the rescue whenever we got stuck. There were multiple carrier days, and on these days we were free from coding but had to join the brainstorming career sessions. Career-related classes enriched our profile to the best we could. In both the career days, as well as the projects from the BootCamp we were assigned, random groups. Working in those groups was another level of experience. There were surprise visits into our classrooms for feedback and update about our bootcamps by community experts at WBS Coding School. For the final project phase, I was lucky to be in Berlin because otherwise, I would have missed the quality time that I spent here. The campus is well connected with public transport (even late at night). On campus, I just had to worry about the project, no worries about cooking, and internet speed. Inviting hugs from everyone made it feel like we know us from before (so welcoming). The campus is located next to a beautiful river ""Spree"" which is super amazing when we take breaks between coding. Although it was really cold outside, I think I spent a few hours (all together) with my classmates and instructors. Last but not least, the BootCamp was in English.",coursereport
2496,WBS coding school,2022-12-09,"Pros: Useful tech to apply in job. Mainly learn REACT JavaScript to create website. 3 weeks to learn in the campus were a great plus to meet the community. The management reacts when we have complaints to change teacher. It is important as my batch has a new teacher. Cons: A lot of changes of the trainers, so if the trainer has no experience to teach, then it will be very bad. In my case, we had a new teacher and it was unfortunate. But at the end we manage to ask to change our trainer. It went well at the end. I will recommend this school overall. I have researched all the school in Germany and this should be one of the best school.",coursereport
2497,WBS coding school,2022-12-08,"The program is a solid first stepping stone to the world of technology. Below are some pros and cons: Pros: - The curriculum is rich and up to date. - One gets a very good overview of the web development landscape. - Our class wasn't only a learning space but also a close-knit community for mutual support and having fun. - The community management department was on the money. They were present but not in your face. Their communication was spot on and they even behaved more stellar in person. - The career service is a good initiative but definitely needs to develop further to meet the needs of the students. Cons: - The lectures can be more organized. - The instructions should get some training in teaching methods and intercultural skills. - There should also be an effort to properly understand and respond to a huge array of experiences, professions, educational backgrounds, cultural and ethnic backgrounds that the students bring in.",coursereport

As a student, you could have one on one sessions every week with your main instructor and if that was not enough you even had access to more instructors at any time who could help you individually in any area of the bootcamp. This course is also constantly updated with the latest trends and demands of the industry. I started this bootcamp with zero knowledge on Web development and 15 weeks later I had gathered so much knowledge and practical project experience.

It differentiates itself from other parts of WBS (and as far as I know other more conventional education services in Germany) with a more contemporary approach. Instructors are industry specialists who lead through the curriculum like team leads in the industry. The focus thereby lies not on the outcome but on the individual growth. I always felt understood in my problems and that there is no hindrance in bringing up any minor issue. What you get: - Skills on what to do in for certain reoccurring problems in the field - Room to test and improve on said skills - at least touch all relevant areas in the industry - a very trustworthy certificate - if you want a personal connection to the instructors, the wbs team, your class mates and also to the other students What you don't get: - University or school like frontal lessons - The bigger background (f. i. there is not time to elaborate why certain statistical operations, or algorithmic methods came to be and what the deeper reason might be - it all remains on a rather practical level) - time to slack (you can do it with extracurricular activities and an effective scheduling discipline, however you will get the most of it, when you really are able to lose yourself in the matter and use the spontaneously appearing spots of nothing is to do to relax) - a degree - an anonymous institution where you fade into the background without being noticed or treated more then a mere number",coursereport

For me was the first week hard as rookie, but you will get along with this training, since there was a very patient instructor who answered questions, which he already explained before and I could not follow everything on first attempt. Speaking of the pros, I can say that there are a lot interesting topics which you learn in this 15 weeks and you have a professional tutor who won't let you down, even if you need to discuss stuff sometimes after 6 pm, he was still there for me.

I have been learning for around 6 months online and 3 weeks full time on campus where I had the chance to Learn and work in developing successfully a project which was something I wanted to do for years. Instructors are hugely knowledgeable, very supportive, fully committed with a great attitude, and best of all, able to transfer complicated knowledge into a practical, effective and understandable way to students like me (Beginners). The material was just spot on and just the right thing to learn with relevant topics and up to date technologies to join the current Market in both Front End and Back End. The approach of the instruction was fantastic allowing us to experience what a real life web development work frame is all about with a solution orientated mind set using all resources to hand in order to solve the problems we find on the way. The last 3 Weeks in Campus was just the final touch for such an amazing learning time ! . We had a fully immerse experience working in our projects along with other students guided by a group of high level instructors which were always ready to help and support us during the way. we did not only code together but pretty much live together surrounded by wonderful atmosphere and great facilities for 3 weeks at Berlin campus in a great location next to the river with all you might need to have a more than fantastic stay. The food was great ! and we had during the whole 3 weeks a very good variety of vegetarian food which I am already missing ! : ) ... On top of all of that and all the coding related training we also had a great assistance to help us to prepare ourselves for the Job Market using the latest tools, tips and techniques to hit the Job Market successfully. The course was very thorough and did not only focus in coding but also in other important aspects such as presentation skills, effective communication, agile methodology, project management, and much more in order to build our Junior Developers profile into a more complete and professional one with a good mix of soft and hard skills which are fundamental for the role in Tech.

Not only did I learn how to design a website or get a server running, I also discovered a whole new side of myself and my abilities. Most of what we did in the course would have seemed impossible a few months ago! Yes, the beginning was challenging and yes, stuff can get complicated with all the new vocabulary, technologies and frameworks. BUT I always felt well supported by my amazing teacher, my fellow students and the staff. After a few days in the program, I was totally hooked. In the end, the schedule was maybe the most challenging part for me working full time and spending evenings and weekends in my part time course. I really liked the hands-on approach to teaching and the additional materials provided by the school. Also, there were lots of free events (recap sessions, guest speaker talks from important tech-companies for networking...). The school shared interesting job ads and helped with our CVs, which was also important for me given the special requirements in the tech-sector. Overall, I really loved the whole experience and I am sure it has changed my way for good. The only con I can think of is the tight schedule. However, we gave our feedback to the school and they immediately changed the program for future part time students.

Short summary: If you are looking for a career change and want to become a Web Developer I can only recommend this Bootcamp to you. Long version: The one thing I liked the most were the frequent group-works. Almost every week you work together in a small group on a weekly project that focuses on the things you learn during that week. This does not only help to practice the learned stuff, but also helps you to bond really well with your classmates. By the end it really felt like we were one big group of friends. :) Another bonus is that, by the end, you have a lot of cool projects that you can present in your job applications, something that is by far more valuable than any certificate (which you also get at the end). The curriculum is well planned. It has a big focus on what is asked for at the job market. There is a red line through out all of the weeks in the Bootcamp and it fits together very well. Because there are so many things that you learn the curriculum definitely is tough, but manageable. (But don't expect to have time for other things during those 15 weeks.) The complete staff was incredibly nice and supportive at all times. There were times where a Junior Instructor would help us solve a problem we were stuck on even at 11PM on the weekend... A big focus is also making sure that you are well prepared for job application. The carreer service helped us in many different ways, be it personally with helping with motivational letters, writing our CV, interview training, polishing our LinkedIn profile or other things. If you are a career shifter and are looking to get into coding I can wholeheartedly recommend this Bootcamp.

( hmmm i do feel like i understand whats going on) ..... and finally (i can actually do things ! ). so lets talk about what i enjoyed the most in this bootcamp : 1 - practicing what i have already learned with my mates. 2 - watching graduator's final projects. 3 - the main lectures are recorded. 4 - career services can be very helpful. Lets talk about the things that i didn't really enjoy : 1 - The feeling that this course is more about letting you know stuff then actually training you to do stuff. i am sure that this is due to the short time that you have available to learn the curriculum. 2 - It costs almost 12k in euros ! I have been funded by the job center so it was fine, but what about the people who are not funded by job center ? There is more stuff about what i didn't like but they are more relative to each person and each background.

This was my average day: 9am morning stand-up; every person says shortly what they did yesterday, if they faced with any problem then my teacher would mark it down to have a 1 on 1 later to see where the problem was. 9:30-12 lessons and/or a small exercise. 12-1pm lunchtime. 1pm - 4pm coding exercises; mostly we start the exercise by ourselves and then join to the group and try to solve it together. The exercises and lessons were recorded, so we can watch it later. 4-6pm group work; every week or two there is a group project where we apply all programming languages we learned up to this point. In the begging I though the lessons are the most important part, but later I realized it was the group exercises, because I learned the most by trying to do something. Overall the course was intense, but I leaned so much. You won't learn everything, there is soooo much more, but it's enough to get that first job and to know what to learn next after the bootcamp.

I have the most positive impressions from my time in WBS Coding School because of the extremely kind staff, the very good instructors always ready to intervene and help me unstack, and the nice atmosphere in the class even if it was online. The only thing that I would wand different is the time devoted to the Full-stack development program. I felt that the 15-week period was not enough for such a diverse curriculum. I wish to have more time in school (perhaps 30 weeks and 2 or 4 months internship ). pros polite staff, genuine interest to solve any matter, good instructors, helpful instructors that were ready to intervene and help me unstack from any project. cons too short time for a such diverse and demanding curriculum.",coursereport
2542,WBS coding school,2021-02-22,"Review of the 15-week Full Stack Web and App Development course at the WBS Coding School. It has been a good experience doing this course. I started with almost 0 previous experience in coding and I learned A LOT in Front- and Backend Development. The course went through a good amount of topics, the most important ones were included according to me. Also, the instructors are very professional and always ready to help when difficulties show up (which occurs at some point). The proposed group projects were the best part of the course according to me as it allows to put the theoretical knowledge into praxis. Notice: next to the theoretical part of the course, it is also important to be able to look for solutions on the web (on YouTube etc) on its own and look for further documentation.",coursereport
2543,WBS coding school,2021-01-06,"I've always been passionate about computers and wanted to learn web development and programming in general. I tried on my own when I was a teenager but at the time all the tools and support that you can find now wasn't out there, also I didn't know English which narrowed down my learning possibilities a lot. The only choice was going to university, but I didn't do that. I went abroad and started on a totally different path leaving that dream behind me. At the age of 30, exactly 15 years later, that dream was still haunting me and that's when I decided to bet everything I had and enrolled to WBS Coding School. It was the best choice I've ever made. It taught me everything I needed to know, it gave me all the skills I needed not just to get started as a Junior Developer, but also all the foundations I needed to learn anything I want on my own. It served me as a guide and helped me understand the world of programming, but the most important thing I gained after the course were people. Connections. I made it into the developer community and it's getting bigger day by day. Definitely recommend taking the course.",coursereport
2544,WBS coding school,2020-11-27,"There are quite a few coding classes and courses that I attended (after studying media information science I attended 6 additional courses when counting those with a duration of at least 3 weeks), the ""Full-Stack Web & App Development"" course has been my favorite so far for various reasons: ""Boot camp""-style: fast-paced, intense, focused (750 hours in 15 weeks), I probably never learned more within 15 weeks. People: my small batch of fellow students (great people), helpful and friendly WBS staff. Instructors: The main instructor of our course is a coder by choice and a trainer by heart. Perfect match for the course, a great guy from Paris, even beyond his coding skills. Clever and very friendly co-instructors. Curriculum/Skills: modern, full-stack, immediately applicable. Guidance to teamwork: Autodidactically I would probably have chosen a different learning path (more on my own or with a small group) but the WBS did a lot better. Not only by guiding the first steep part of the learning curve to complex new technologies but also by focusing on teamwork early on. First group work took place in week 2 (remotely) and it really evolved a lot from there (collaborative planning/coding, teamworking on Github, project management). In my opinion, that's one of the aspects that the WBS Coding school did a lot better than other classes or courses I attended before. Hands-on: a high percentage of practical coding, groupwork as well as solo projects. Real-world: projects that you can add to your portfolio/repo, develop further and/or show to interviewers. Motivation: I feel motivated and eager to further develop the skills I learned in the boot camp. Any of them make sense, the selected stacks are more than an introduction to modern and scalable full-stack development. I'm curious how my fellow students will evolve their skills and I really enjoy staying in touch. More than that: it really felt like turning the struggles of a pandemic lockdown into an opportunity to feed my brain and meet new people. There was no ability to travel, fewer assignments, fewer in-person training opportunities, so I used my spare time to do a remote course with 3 weeks on campus and brush up my coding skills and network. Feels like the right decision, what a ride!",coursereport
2545,WBS coding school,2020-11-23,"I applied to WBS Coding School because of the special format of 12-weeks online and 3-weeks face-to-face on campus in Berlin. It was a great opportunity to have the freedom to learn from home or wherever in the world while enhancing virtual and international teamwork. My first pretty good impression of the coding-test, which was mainly about checking the fast-learning-abilities and the friendly interview were proven during the whole Bootcamp. The staff is super nice, caring and helpful. We were a small batch with a great and private learning atmosphere. Our instructor was experienced in many different fields and always available for support and feedback. It really felt like working with friends. The online-learning-platform is easy to use and pretty helpful. The staff is continuously improving content and structure and takes feedback thankfully and seriously and tries to apply. The tech stack we learned is up-to-date and fits well together. It is a tough and intense way of learning, but in the end all puzzle pieces came together and resulted in unique and cool final projects we presented on demo-day. We all were proud of what we were able to learn and code after 15 weeks. But of course, it is just the start :) The time on-campus in Berlin was the best part. The location is nice, the food really good, the rooms basic, but nice and the staff is super friendly.

Thankfully my advisor at the Job Federal Ministry pointed WBS Coding School to me. The curriculum itself is ambitious and extensive but provides a rich overview of both the software development industry as a whole and Javascript-based environments in particular. The fact that it's structured as an hybrid bootcamp (12 weeks online / 3 weeks on-campus) really help me progressively integrate it in my life, also, the 15-week duration was key in my decision as most bootcamps are just 9 weeks long and I thought it wouldn't be enough for me. The lead and junior instructors are really patient, knowledgeable and give their everything for you to understand the topics at hand. The staff is amazing and always welcoming. The job support is equally good workshops, guest speakers and personalized coaching. Finally, but definitely the most enjoyable part of this journey: you'll meet amazing people. I had the fortune of having amazing classmates from different cultural and academic backgrounds, that fostered a really ideas-rich environments in which to thrive, and you can always count of them to help you through.

All these youtube videos, mini bootcamps etc really made me feel like the dumbest person ever. While I was looking for a serious platform, I found out that at WBS school they were about to start with a Full Stack Web and App development boot camp. I previously did some other courses at WBS and they are really really good. So I went for the Coding Bootcamp with almost zero knowledge. The course is fast paced but the teachers are incredibly patient! They make sure you keep up and they have for every student an approach that suits them best. I never knew that I would be capable of learning and creating so much awesome stuff, just in 12 weeks!! The highlight and the biggest advantage that WBS Codingschool offers is definitely the last 3 weeks on Campus!! No other school offers a real life experience like this!! Being in a fancy „Vegetarian-hotel„ for 3 weeks, with your classmates, teacher and coaches for 3 weeks working on your final project, that is just awesome!! The team spirit, the live-coaching, your teacher and other teachers available on site to help you in every step of the way; that is priceless!!!

Yanish and Lisardo clearly have a lot of fun in their jobs and together teaching classes. They were always approachable for personal help and happy to do so. The fact, that the different projects are not graded takes out the pressure which is a good and a bad thing.. sometimes it takes away motivation, but sometimes it gives motivation because you do the project for yourself instead of someone else. The fact, that they advertise the camp with „no coding experience needed“ is very optimistic in my opinion, I took their word for it and didn‘t prepare myself with coding tutorials or similar before.. That made it very hard for me and at some points I almost gave up when it came to code. Anyway I made it through and now know definitely more than before. The campus phase is a highlight for sure, after 13 weeks of working with classmates online, meeting everyone and the instructors takes the whole camp on another level.

2554,WBS coding school,2024-04-18,"I completed a Marketing Analytics course in April, but unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. I really don’t understand the positive reviews I read here. The course content was extremely superficial, lacking any in-depth exploration of the subject matter. I enrolled with high expectations and a desire to learn extensively, but the actual instruction time was disappointingly brief—often just 45 minutes to an hour. After that, we were left to complete simple tasks or exercises that hardly took any time, leaving us with hours of idle time daily. There were no clear objectives or milestones; everything was very relaxed, and there was minimal review of the exercises. The amount of time we spent on irrelevant topics like Google Tag Manager, rather than focusing on Google Analytics, SQL, Python, or JavaScript, was also absurd. I have yet to encounter a job that requires GTM, yet it was the primary focus of the course. Much of the course material consisted of external web pages, LinkedIn articles/videos, and YouTube videos. While these can be acceptable as supplementary resources, they should not form the core content of a class. For a program costing 10,000 euros for four months—equivalent to a year of tuition at many private universities—it is unacceptable that WBS did not create its own content. Previously, I attended Ironhack for a similar-duration program, and the quality, especially in Data Analytics, was significantly superior. Ironhack also offered numerous social activities and gatherings at no extra cost. Additionally, Ironhack provides career services for a year post-graduation, whereas this course offered just a month of generic career advice. The career services were particularly disappointing, offering one-size-fits-all advice rather than tailored guidance. During my one-on-one CV review, the feedback was clearly not personalized; the ""advisor"" insisted I highlight this bootcamp over my extensive professional experience, despite my degree and career being in marketing. This demonstrated a lack of effort in reviewing my CV, and that was the only one-on-one interaction I had with career services. The person didn't even bother reading my resume to provide me with useful feedback. At Ironhack, you have a year of support from Career Services after your graduation. Here, it was one month and then goodbye (which I never used because you are removed from Discord anyway). Now I am at CareerFoundry (because I needed to take another course due to the lack of quality from this one), and the content is all created by them. You have a mentor, a tutor, and even another tutor specifically for job searching who provides personalized feedback. Everything they offer is so much better and also cheaper. There was a graduation celebration, but it required an additional fee (considering many of us who attended the course are unemployed), which felt stingy. The course was advertised as a hybrid model with the last two weeks on campus, yet we only had one day on-site. This bootcamp was a disappointment, and my classmates and I were thoroughly disillusioned. Several peers lodged complaints with Jobcenter due to the poor quality, especially given the high cost. I noticed that this course is no longer offered on the website. If I had paid for this out of pocket, I would have been extremely upset. Despite providing feedback multiple times, I was met with excuses such as the course being designed for career changers (a detail not mentioned anywhere). This reasoning makes it worse, because if you were, for example, a photographer, I don't understand how you would be prepared to find a job with such deficient preparation. Another excuse was the necessity of using external content due to rapid technological changes, which is their responsibility to update—and it's a terrible excuse. Providers like CareerFoundry, who are 100% online, manage to create their own up-to-date content, using external materials as supplements rather than core components. Why can't WBS do the same? Because they don't want to make the effort—it's that simple. Interestingly, as mentioned, the course has now been removed—possibly due to the negative feedback? I don't know. I would not recommend this course to anyone, especially if you are paying out of your own pocket. You would be better off watching YouTube videos or enrolling in cheaper online courses for each topic you want to learn, such as SQL or JavaScript, where you would learn more and save money.",coursereport

Entering the boot camp with zero IT language knowledge seemed daunting, but WBS proved to be the perfect choice. The diverse mix of students in the class, many like me with limited technical background, created a supportive environment. The standout feature, however, was the experienced trainers.

2562,WBS coding school,2023-08-28,"I believe a significant number of reviews are left by students who have just completed the course and are still riding the wave of enthusiasm. Initially, I was informed that upon finishing the course, one could opt for any data career path and that the employment rate stood at 90%, among other claims. However, my perspective shifted considerably a few months later when I confronted the reality. The program is demanding and packed with content. Spanning a mere 14 weeks, it encompasses Data Analysis, Engineering, and Data Science. Naturally, the scope of knowledge imparted remains somewhat shallow. A substantial portion of the instruction felt rushed, with projects completed without a profound grasp of the underlying mathematical principles. Both the junior instructors and the main instructor are program alumni, proficient at guiding through projects but less effective at conveying what the professional world anticipates. Regrettably, their insight into their own data career path, which is somewhat lacking. In a conversation with an alumnus, I learned that fewer than 40% of their batch secured employment within six months. Upon conversing with industry peers, it dawned on me that I'm competing directly with individuals who hold master's degrees. Without a STEM master's degree and some coding background, your CV is swiftly discarded. While those transitioning from a STEM background might find the course an entry point into the data realm, I am hesitant to claim it's universally suitable. Contrary to its portrayal as a fast track to financial success and life transformation, a career in Data Science is difficult even for people with solid science background. The support for career progression is adequate, with only three general workshops available. However, I've discovered that other bootcamps offer 1 to 1 personalized career coaching, which is particularly crucial for career changers. Additionally, the course concluded without any guidance on constructing a robust portfolio. I invested a considerable amount of time researching and revisiting material from other bootcamps and their graduates portfolio. Unfortunately, this is an area where this bootcamp really falls short. In terms of the course content, I would rate it 4 stars. It's evident that the staff has dedicated considerable effort to developing the curriculum. However, when evaluating the course's effectiveness in assisting career changers, I would give it 2 stars. Particularly for individuals lacking a STEM degree who are contemplating a career change and questioning if this course is the right path, it falls short. I recommend considering a Data Analyst course instead. Such a program is more feasible; in just five months, you can create a remarkably impressive portfolio with a specific focus.",coursereport

2567,WBS coding school,2023-05-08,"After reading numerous positive reviews, I decided to start the hybrid bootcamp at the beginning of this year. The first week was okay, as everything was new, and I had the opportunity to get to know the other students. After that, you could see one flaw after the other. Below, it is a list with all the problems that I saw during my time in this bootcamp: Curriculum: Everything is crammed together, you just breeze through the material without understanding the principles of the concepts that were 'thought'. As an example, the ML parts lasted for a couple of weeks, which is really insane. The A/B testing project, also crammed together, and you have to learn many concepts in just one day. Impossible. I will just stop here because if I start to break it apart, I won't finish today. 2/10 Instructor: Junior instructors were extremely friendly, that was nice, they didn't know much about basic things, but they were always ready to help. My instructor was probably the most condescending person I have ever met. Also, she started every day an hour late because starting at 9:00 HS was too early, roughly, more than 50 hours wasted in the morning. Besides, she used to tell us to basically LIE to her boss if he asked what time we started. She also encouraged students to compete instead of working together. 1/10 Projects: The projects are definitely not real life projects, nor job ready projects. They are more like Kaggle projects which you can find anywhere on the internet for free and copy and paste them into your GitHub. 2/10 Job assistance: Non-existent. I've only got a couple of emails to ask if I found a job, when I protested about this and finally got a chat with an advisor, it was a 15 minutes talk where the person said that I need to optimize my LinkedIn. Funny thing though is that I had a few months back a workshop where we did exactly that, optimize my LinkedIn profile. 0/10 Overall experience: Really poor. They have a nice place to work and good food in the cantina for students that stay there, that is about it. It is definitely not worth that amount of money (you can get a master’s degree in the UK for this price). I was fortunate enough to get sponsored by the job agency, but the feeling is that I wasted tax money.

I believe there are good instructors at this school, but it should not be a lottery. Since complaining about it, i have realized that there are no quality control mechanisms: nobody checks what the instructor is doing, how much the students have learned so far, how much time the instructor spends actually teaching. There are all easy to objectively check. The schools strategy is to claim that the instructor is not a teacher, but like a senior developer - he only helps out if we have questions. We are supposed to be self-sufficient and search for the answers ourselves. As a beginner I fundamentally disagree with this philosophy because 1. We are not their employees, they are our service providers, so we have a right to demand quality for our 10.000 Euros. And 2. We are not developers, we are complete beginners making our first baby steps, who objectively need their hand held at every step. Period. So yea please before making a decision, for your sake: ask how much of the time in percentage your instructor will actually spend in the classroom, how many students there will be, what are the concrete mechanisms to assure the quality of the teaching and how do they intend to help you when you need help.

Unfortunately, I can't agree with what is written here as reviews. Maybe curriculum and content of the lessons were o.k. But overall the class instruction was not satisfactory. I talked about this with other fellow students in my class and they think like me too. Compared to other classes, the instructor is constantly unavailable and the questions of students remain unanswered. You always had to study and work on your own. Students are left alone most of the time. You paid such a huge sum of money for the course, but accordingly all of the lessons during the bootcamp were not even sufficient and even miserable. Job assistance is also just as meager and unhelpful. probably this school does not treat its students with hearts. That's sad. WBS Coding School could have done better with their students.

At the end, after the bootcamp you have to learn a lot more for yourself in order to find a job, because the bootcamp didn't bring you much in the end",coursereport
2576,WBS coding school,2021-10-17,"600 hours of new knowledge input, collaborative pet projects, and intense practicing periods... All made possible and guided by WBS Coding School and their super cool staff. Frankly, I don't have any other coding school to directly compare my experience with, however, I really wanted to endorse their program here since I went ""from zero to hero"" thanks to them. Doing the part-time Web Development course with WBS was my personal highlight ever since the pandemic broke out. Prior to the official start of the course, the school provided all participants with so-called ""primer"" exercises on HTML and CSS which helped us get into the mood. Later, we were introduced to our instructor who would (virtually) stay right by our side as lecturer, coach, and source of knowledge for the entire time of the course. Every new week was filled with new content, valuable real-life insights, and challenging exercises. For my part, investing in myself at WBS was worthwhile all along. Towards the end of the program, we were all offered special career services, too, making sure we all had our CVs updated and our interview skills ready for the tech world. And what can I say, right after graduation I landed my first full-time job in the software sector. Kudos to WBS Coding School for their inspiring work and for helping me kickstart my career in tech!",coursereport
2577,WBS coding school,2021-03-17,"The program is basically a crash course where you can achieve knowledge of the overall front end and back end architecture. The program is compact and includes learning as well as job preparation in 3 months. WBS has competent instructors who make you ready for the job market. Pros are even if you are a beginner you would end up knowing a lot about the technologies involved and igniting the interest. Cons are you would not be 100% job ready unless you put your own effort to get into depth in each area, which may take additional time.",coursereport
2578,WBS coding school,2020-10-30,"I chose WBS Coding School because of its hybrids format (12 weeks online, 3 weeks on-campus). I think it's a great concept, and it worked practically as well. It meant that I could actually do the bootcamp at all, since I don't have the money to pay for housing in a city for 3 months like a lot of bootcamps want. For bootcamps like that, you really just get people who have the money. WBS also had a lot of funding options through partners and the Agentur für Arbeit here in Germany, which is how I think a lot of people paid for the bootcamp. The staff takes feedback very gracefully, and is very quick to react to suggestions or complaints. I always felt that I could give my criticism/feedback to basically any staff member, and I felt that they really listened. The community manager in particular was incredibly sensitive and really listened and took action on a lot of things. The career services at the school are also great, and I felt really supported. The on-campus portion of the course is also fun, the food is great, the housing is clean and private, and you can really focus on your projects. The platform that the school built for the materials is easy to navigate, and felt like a good homebase. I also really loved our teacher, and felt like we really learned a good mindset for going forward. That said, the curriculum definitely needs improvements. The tech stack they've chosen is great and very modern, but the lectures and exercises leave something to be desired. They may fix this by the time I've written this, but it's worth saying that if you do this bootcamp, learn the basics of HTML/CSS/JavaScript really well, and take time outside of class to learn the concepts, otherwise you will be stressed most of the time. That all said, I definitely feel like we learned the concepts and were thrown into realistic situations to force us to learn and grow. All in all, I would definitely recommend this bootcamp and absolutely feel like it was worth my time and effort.",coursereport

2583,Codeworks,2024-07-14,"Codeworks curriculum and instructors are phenomenal. I tend to overthink and over research when spending a lot of money on a program and consequently have a lot of experience and familiarity with different programs. I actually started attending the App Academy online program. App Academy is known to be one of the top school in the states but their online program at least, I found to be severely lacking. You only had exposure to one instructor, who was also a recent graduate of the program. I also took a NuCamp program, which for the cost was good but it doesn't really get you job ready. Codeworks on the other hand, has a much higher barrier to entry. You have to do some fairly advanced coding just to get in and know JavaScript fairly well under the hood. You also need to do a technical and culture fit interview, along with building a basic app. So I do agree that the take you from 30% to 100%, rather than the typical beginner to 70%. You get much more out of it, having already done work ahead of time. Their instructors are also industry veterans and very nice people, who work hard for you. I actually signed up for the full Software Dev program but only had the time to complete the shorter course, so I missed out on the group projects but don't think that hurt me much. Overall the curriculum is excellent. We got exposure to numerous frameworks, ie: Angular (not a fan, haha!), React (love it!). One thing I forgot to add in my other review, you get the complete developer experience. Many courses I took in the past left out some aspects of development but here you build full stack apps, with database connections, API's and all. We did spend time on data structures and algorithms. For me this was the most challenging aspect and feel it would use a bit more fine tuning and thought into how best to learn these concepts. The only other draw back was that if at any time you have to pause the program and join up with a later cohort, you lose access to the learning platform and are cut off from communication from other students. Also, once you graduate, you lose access to the learning platform as well and all github repos from the lessons are pulled. I have never taken a program where this was the case. Typically you have life time access to these kinds of assets but they guard them closely. However they do say to make copies of what you want for notes so it's not the end of the world. Overall, I would definitely recommend this program. It's quite a bit less expensive than something like App Academy and in my opinion, at a higher level.",coursereport
2584,Codeworks,2024-04-15,"Overall I am really please with Codeworks' Web Development Immersive bootcamp. Codeworks' curriculum is structured into several phases, each targeting specific skills and knowledge areas that gave me what I need to break into the industry. Here's a breakdown: Pre-course (remote): Students begin with a 60-hour preparatory course covering the fundamentals of programming, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This phase ensures that all attendees have a baseline level of knowledge before diving deeper. Main Course (I did remotely): This phase is the core of the bootcamp, lasting 8 weeks (12 weeks if you do Software Engineering Immersive). It is divided into two main sections: - Junior Phase: Focuses on foundational web technologies like JavaScript ES6+, React, Node.js, Express, and SQL & NoSQL databases. It also covers essential concepts in software engineering such as data structures, algorithms, and version control with Git. - Senior Phase: Shifts focus towards more complex topics, including security and authentication. If you go for the software engineering immersive, you'll also learn about DevOps practices, including continuous integration and deployment, which are highly valued in the industry. Projects and Hands-On Learning: The curriculum emphasizes real-world applicability through project-based learning. I went through one solo project, but if again if you are on the 12 week program, you'll get to experience 2 more group projects which really helps simulate real-life scenarios and working in teams to develop functional web applications. Career Services and Industry Preparation: The bootcamp concludes with intensive job preparation workshops. These include mock interviews, portfolio development, and networking strategies, tailored to meet the demands of tech employers.",coursereport

Community: The people at Codeworks made the journey enjoyable. Lucky to have been surrounded by such a supportive and friendly cohort. Areas for Improvement: Instructor Support: While the instructors were friendly, there were moments when assistance with coding challenges was limited. There's room for improvement in this aspect.

2590,Codeworks,2023-10-01,"Pros:- Comprehensive Curriculum: The bootcamp covered both front-end and back-end technologies comprehensively, ensuring a holistic understanding of full-stack development.- Hands-on Projects: Real-world projects were integrated throughout the course, allowing me to apply the learned concepts in a practical setting.- Diverse Teaching Methods: The bootcamp employed a variety of teaching methods, including lectures, interactive exercises, and Q&A sessions, catering to different learning styles.- Peer Interaction: Collaborative group projects and discussion forums promoted active engagement and peer learning.- Career Support: Post-bootcamp support, including resume reviews and interview prep, significantly boosted my confidence in job hunting. Cons:- Inconsistent Instructor Experience: While most educators had extensive industry experience and were adept at explaining complex topics, some were recent graduates of the program themselves and lacked deeper industry experience.- Pace: The bootcamp's fast-paced nature might be challenging for some, necessitating considerable self-study.- Time Commitment: Given the intensive curriculum, balancing the bootcamp with other personal or professional commitments was occasionally tough.- Cost: While the bootcamp offered a wealth of knowledge, the tuition might be on the higher side for some. Overall, the bootcamp provided a solid foundation in full-stack development. Despite certain challenges, the depth of content and quality of instruction made it a worthwhile investment for my career growth. Admittedly, it can be somewhat costly and demands a full-time commitment, but the payoff is significant. The program equips students with the skills needed to secure a junior position in a company, and the best part is that anyone can succeed. In just about six months—spanning the application phase, a one-month pre-course, and a three-month main course—you can transition from a novice to a competent web developer, complete with a small portfolio. It's important to understand that although the tuition might appear high, the quality and depth of the content provided match the price. However, the true depth of your learning will HEAVILY DEPEND on your own commitment and motivation. Reflecting on my journey, while I am happy with the outcomes of this bootcamp, should I begin again, I'd also explore other alternatives, potentially seeking more affordable options or those with a greater emphasis on projects.

2592,Codeworks,2023-09-14,"PROs: Topics of study are relevant for the industry at the moment, the tools you learn are applicable to a wide range of full-stack/FE/BE developer positions. Lectures and exercises are well structured. Very competent instructors. Good career follow-up and support. Access to a wide network of developers. Most students show up every morning with an open mindset and are willing to be collaborative and to support each other. You will learn A LOT. CONs: INTENSE. 12 hrs a day for 12 weeks, requires a huge commitment, you can't do anything on the side (barely have time to sleep, eat or workout) xD so you have to plan your day, your meals and your time off. Impossible to have another job/internship on the side or any other sort of commitment that require any time/energy from you. You need to be healthy! Missing a few lectures will set you back cause it is extremely fast paced. Come with the right mindset, frustration and failure will be part of it and you still need to be professional and be a good team player :)",coursereport
2593,Codeworks,2023-06-22,"I loved my time at Codeworks. It is a rare thing to wake up feeling like your excited about all the new things you're going to learn. For me, Codeworks was like this every day for 3 months straight. Due to the exclusive nature of the entrance requirements, you are more or less guaranteed to be working with and around a group of incredibly smart people, and due to this there are few times in my life when I’ve felt more intellectually stimulated. This, combined with a well thought out curriculum and a great support system, results in learning more in a shorter space of time than I previously would have thought possible. ProsThe great curriculum and efficient teaching methodologies ensure that at the end of the course you feel, and in fact are, uniquely prepared to face the challenge of your first job in the tech world. The excellent post-graduation job search system ensures that you maximise this potential. ConsIt's unfathomably intense, and the burnout at the end is pretty harsh. Essentially, expect to have nothing else in your life for three months. If you can manage that it is certainly worth it.

2595,Codeworks,2023-06-21,"Codeworks was an amazing experience to learn and grow as a developer. The course is broken into 3 different portions: Junior, Senior, and Job Search. The experience overall was great and helped me learn full stack development and the curriculum is really solid. You get what you put in as with all bootcamps understand that you will be dedicating 8-12 hours daily to code, meet with instructors, watch lectures, etc. Codeworks introduces pair programming, but you don't necessarily need to pair program and during the latter parts of the junior portion most of my small cohort broke into individuals rather than pair programming. The junior and senior phase are separated by a week long break. Junior Phase: The junior phase teaches you concepts in sprints that last 1-4 days each. The concepts include full stack JavaScript development and also introduce TypeScript and a ton of related frameworks/technologies. The curriculum can be overwhelming, but in a good way. It is important to stay focused on the main goal and take breaks, etc. Some of the sprints are more relaxed and you will get time to chill out and continue learning or reviewing stuff after you finish your exercise. An exercise is given for each sprint that reinforces the learning and lets you explore a bit more into each topic. The day to day breakdown is mainly a toy problem (think of a leetcode type question or small exercise) to warm you up, a video lecture, Q&A's and then the exercises. There is a check-in daily for 10-15 minutes to see if you need any additional help, etc. and you can request help at any time and you will get an instructor that can break down/explain things. There is weekly exams in the junior portion to see where you are at as far as knowledge goes, but it does not matter if you do well or not, it is mostly just a way for the instructors to see how you are doing. The final exam is on the last day of the junior portion where you build a simple full stack app and if you do not complete it in time, you get 3-4 days over the weekend to finish it. Again, don't worry, you will be well prepared for it by that point and it is a simple app. Senior Phase: The senior portion of the bootcamp is all project based. You will do 3 projects that help you solidify concepts taught in the junior phase. The first is a solo project that you will build on your own with the tech stack of your choice. The second is a re-factoring project where you will re-factor someone else's solo project with a partner into TypeScript, implement testing, etc. which is very important because of how popular TypeScript is now. Lastly, you will do a thesis project with a group of 2-5 partners that will be a large scale full stack application. The senior portion is a lot of work, but also more relaxed than the junior because you aren't jumping into new concepts all the time. This is where you will have your portfolio become job search ready and learn concepts to actually land a job. Job Search: The job search portion is the last 1.5 weeks of the senior portion. You will have lectures on how to re-factor your resume/CV and LinkedIn pages as well as interview preparation, job search advice, career talks, etc. Landing a job is obviously the goal of every student after bootcamp and the current market is very tough. You will have to put in time and dedication into the job search but it is worth it. Job Hunt: The job hunt is of course pretty brutal and tough, specifically in the US market, but it is worth it. I applied to over a thousand companies mainly using LinkedIn's Easy Apply feature that allows you to apply very quickly. I got around 10 total calls of legitimate recruiters/companies reaching out for a first round interview in 3 weeks total after the bootcamp. Out of those 10, I had 5 or so that moved to the second step and 2 that got through to the final step with 1 job offer that I accepted. The job offer was 115k salary remote in the US. I applied for all jobs across the board regardless of experience level as long as they were junior/mid-level software engineer/full stack developer positions with JavaScript/TypeScript.",coursereport

I attended the Codeworks bootcamp from end-July to end-October 2022. Prior to being admitted to the bootcamp, I went through a screening interview, built a simple web app and completed pre-course assignments. The bootcamp essentially filters out real beginner who knows nothing about web development and focuses on people who have certain levels of web dev knowledge and are committed to seeking a career as a software engineer. Due to the strict selection process, the bootcamp instructors and syllabus were able to drill down in-depth on various computer science topics such as Data Structures and Algorithms, and discussed various important JavaScript concepts, characteristics and properties and prepared one to be an expert in JavaScript and the relevant libraries and frameworks within 6 weeks. This turned out to be incredibly useful knowledge and preparation for the tech interviews. In the 2nd 6 weeks, I built a solo project, and worked with other participants for 2 other projects. I was able to built a portfolio of projects to showcase my knowledge and experience to potential employers after the completion of the bootcamp. The career service was also outstanding in helping me with my job search following the completion of the bootcamp. I received 3 offers within a month after the bootcamp and was really thrilled with the great outcome. Feel free to look me up on LinkedIn if you wish to verify my review. Pros: The tutors really drilled down in-depth on JavaScript topics and prepare one to be an expert in JavaScript Worked on 3 projects to allow one to showcase to potential employers Worked with a team of other engineers and learnt about collaboration techniques and communication with others Cons: One has to be prepared to go through really long hours - 12 hours a day for 6 days a week - but this is also how one can be well-equipped after the bootcamp to handle any technical interviews or coding challenges",coursereport

I (and some of my coursemates) think the lecture materials could be improved and lecture/ review hours could be longer. The only downside is Job Assistance, besides a short mock-up interview with the instructor during the course, Web Dev students do not have any further career support like Software Dev students have after completing the course such as weekly calls with the outcome team. Maybe because I didn't pay as much to have this service. But I hope Codeworks would consider adding this for Web Dev too.

But after I spoke with an old family friend who is the Vice President of the tech department at a very large corporation, he offered to review the course curriculum. After his review, he gave me his approval along with some caveats. And so my parents and I decided to go for it. I borrowed some money from a friend and my parents took some money out of their life savings to cover the tuition costs. Even though I had my doubts in the success rates at Codeworks, I knew that if I worked hard enough and I made it through this course, I would have a very good chance at landing an actual junior position as a software engineer. Their curriculum is solid and it gives you a great foundation to build on. After graduating from this course I applied for an internship at ironforge and I landed my first full-time position as a developer in just less than four weeks after the completion of the course. The course was not easy. There were moments where I felt like I was not cut out for this. But I didn’t give up and the instructors and tutors were always there to encourage and support you when your struggling. I learned so much in just a short amount of time and I’m very glad that I joined Codeworks. It was well worth the money and time. The instructors are very knowledgeable and they have a lot of hands on experience. If your wondering if Codeworks is the right choice for you, I would say that you have a lot of choices but if you really want to be ready to start your career after the course as a junior software engineer then you should go for it. If you have any questions you can find me on LinkedIn! And I’d be more than happy to share my experience!",coursereport
2604,Codeworks,2021-06-23,"I signed up for Codeworks' Software Engineering Immersive course after deciding to switch careers. Doing so was one of the best decisions of my life. Within three weeks of finishing the course I secured my first role as a developer. After deciding that I'd apply to study with Codeworks, I was fortunate enough to be able to spend three months preparing for the course full-time. If you have other responsibilities, you should perhaps plan to give yourself at least 6 months to complete the application process and pre-course materials. The admissions team are all really friendly and can help advise based on your personal situation. The course itself is split into two six week sections, with a short break in-between. The first half of the course consists of daily exercises and coding challenges and are supported by short lectures, code reviews, and study materials. A typical day starts with a code challenge and then dives straight into lectures and a Q&A session. You'll spend most of the day coding alongside a partner to solve a tough exercise and at the end of the day review a solution with an instructor. During my cohort they were experimenting with delivering lectures via pre-recorded video. Whilst video lectures are a good idea, this first iteration wasn't great. That said, you soon come to see that the lectures are a tiny part of the learning experience. Codeworks' teaching philosophy follows the firehose method. You will be exposed to so many ideas and new technologies so quickly at times it will feel extremely overwhelming. All I can say is put your trust in the methodology and in your instructors. Get comfortable with feeling out of your depth and confused - that's partially the point! You're being trained to encounter difficult concepts and seek out the information you need in order to understand and apply them. Weekly assessments will help you identify areas that you need to work on, and guidance is only ever a help request away. All of the instructors were extremely friendly and were fantastic at helping you find answers and process difficult concepts. Following the first six weeks, you'll have a week off. During this break, you'll likely spend the first half sleeping and the second half preparing for your first senior project. The second half of the course consists of three projects. With these you'll have the opportunity to build an app from scratch all by yourself, to review, test, and improve someone else's project in a pair, and finally to work in a team to deliver a more ambitious application. I would fully recommend doing the entire 12 week course as every project teaches you something slightly different. I found this invaluable when talking about my experience in job interviews. In the final week you'll start preparing for your job hunt. Once the course ends you'll want to keep up this momentum and start applying. I'd recommend that you plan to make time for the job hunt - keep a month free after the course ends. My job hunt ended up being almost as intense as the course. There's a careers advisor on hand to help provide advice and motivation during this phase. I originally felt nervous about signing up for a bootcamp. Even with Codeworks' competitive pricing, it was still the largest sum of money I've ever spent. Following an unpredictable year of freelance work, I couldn't afford for this course not to result in a job. I can now confidently say that all that nervousness was unnecessary. Codeworks prepares you extremely well for the current job market, though you get as much out of the course as you put in. If you are both willing and able to push yourself harder than you ever have done before, can afford to commit to a challenging and exhausting few months, and bring plenty of enthusiasm and positivity I can't recommend it enough. It's tough but it's worth it. If you're completely new to coding and unsure whether it's for you, I'd recommend trying out Harvard's free CS50x course - it'll put you in a good place to start your Codeworks application!",coursereport
2605,Codeworks,2021-06-15,"After a long research I finally decided join CodeWorks, as in joining at all, then which bootcamp and was very pleased. Two weeks after graduating I received an offer from a well-known company. As for my background I started learning to code in 2018 in my free time. Despite my prior experience it still was a very challenging, eye-opening and rewarding experience and I learned a lot. Being self-taught I faced major issues hurting my success landing a: - lack of clarity what you need to know, - working in a team (big one) - foundational software engineering skills (think beyond web-dev plus escaping tutorial-hell) - career support I was able to get over all of them, it gave me a lot of clarity, passion and confidence on what's important to work in this industry. The technical knowledge (which is top notch) is only part of the puzzle here. You'll not only learn but embody foundational software engineering skills. It's designed to be challenging, so don't expect to just 'download the knowledge' into your head. It's hard and that's a good thing. You'll receive top-notch support from instructors, career-support team and your peers, that help you grow in the long run.",coursereport
2606,Codeworks,2021-06-04,"I was a student at Codeworks between January and April 2021 at the Berlin Campus. I took the full 12-week Software Engineering course. I would highly recommend Codeworks to anybody who is interested in becoming a Developer. I signed up for the course as I was looking to start a career as a Developer and was impressed by the reviews I saw online. I can honestly say that it really did live up to what I was hoping for. 6 weeks after the course finished, I had multiple job offers from different companies in Berlin for Developer roles. I am now working as a Full Stack Developer with a great company and a great salary. The course is very fast paced and you definitely need to get yourself a bit of experience with coding and a general idea of what being a Developer entails. It is 12 hours a day for 6 days a week so you have to accept that you will not have any sort of social life for 3 months. You also very much get out of it what you put in, so you need to really concentrate and push yourself to learn new things very quickly. Some pros and cons of Codeworks... Pros: - The campus in Berlin is really nice with great facilities - The team in Berlin and the wider company are super friendly and helpful - The content and tech stack is very relevant in regards to what company and employers are using - Once you finish, you receive lifetime career support and guidance which is really helpful Cons: - It is expensive - The lectures are not given face-to-face, they are pre-recorded videos with Q&A sessions afterwards I would say that the pros definitely outweigh the cons, and if you are serious about becoming a Developer then it is a really great option. It's probably one of the smartest things I have ever done!",coursereport
2607,Codeworks,2021-05-23,"Hi everyone, my name is Djordje and I was a Codeworks remote student in the begining of 2021. Before the bootcamp I was a flight attended, and I was a bit skeptical that in 3 month you can learn that much, even without any coding background. But, I was wrong. Pre-course and the course prepare you, and teach you so much, that now in my job I have more or less the same knowledge as the people who are working for a year. It is really intense bootcamp where you won't be able to do anything else, but code, for 12 weeks. You will read, study, write and dream code. You will be coding for 6 days a week, and 12 hours per day and you need to be ready for this both physically and mentally. Even the aplication process and pre-course are really demanding in a way that you will need to make a small game before the bootcamp. The teachers are excellent, always trying to give you the best answers and solutions. Even if sometimes seems that you are stuck, and some things are super confusing, the curriculum is made in that way, that in the end everything makes sense. By the end of 3 month, you will be prepared to search for a job with 3 real-life projects in your CV. I was able to find a job in less than a month after finishing the bootcamp and without any pre-knowledge in the field. I am really satisfied with the knowledge and support I got. All recommendations! 10/10",coursereport
2608,Codeworks,2021-04-01,"I chose Codeworks because it was the most intense and hardest to join of all the bootcamps I could find. As expected, this led to a high level of motivation and skill in my fellow students, which is the best environment to learn in my opinion. Pros: - Well-designed curriculum. By the end, you will know what you need to know to get a job and keep learning by yourself - Learn by doing. Most of the time is spent learning through exercises while pairing with another student, with help available to get you unstuck while needed. Closest thing you can get to individual tuition - Decent job search support. They won't put you in contact with companies directly, but you don't need it. They will teach you the best way to sell yourself and provide ongoing guidance as needed. I found a job within 5 weeks and that was actually slower than the average. Cons: - Intense. Make sure that you have the energy and environment required to follow through - Takes longer to get into than most bootcamps. Past the admission process, the pre-course work can take up to 160h to do properly (assuming limited prior knowledge). Don't rush it or you will struggle at the start. - Javascript only. Does one thing and does it well. That may be a con to some but was a pro for me: learning the language is actually a fairly small part of it. The main value comes in learning the Javascript ecosystem and tools, which you will need to land a front end or full stack job. You will learn programming concepts either way, but how many jobs out there require Ruby ?",coursereport
2609,Codeworks,2021-03-25,"If you're looking into Codeworks, be prepared for some gruelling hours – they're not kidding about the 12 hour days! The course is crazy intense, but I found that my confidence in my skills and in navigating unfamiliar coding situations grew over the 12 weeks. The final 5 weeks are based on building projects, both by yourself and a team – that latter part was invaluable as companies I interviewed at always asked about team-based situations. The last week is focussed on the job search, including updating your CV/LinkedIn, interview practice, and strategies on how to conduct the search. This latter part was a real eye-opener for me as it's the first time I've done a job search so methodically and strategically. I landed a job about three weeks later, and the next time I'm looking for a job, I'll be conducting it in the same way. I also did the course remotely, and I'm really glad I did as it reduced the stress of having to commute to a physical location especially given the hours.",coursereport
2610,Codeworks,2021-02-16,"If one is hesitating whether to do or not do the bootcamp, I would say that there is not need to hesitate. The bootcamp lies the foundation necessary to build upon. It is quite demanding, but completely doable and it's a great start for any ""developer to be"".",coursereport
2611,Codeworks,2021-02-09,"Very demanding experience, but overall coverage of subjects was very good and the people in the course are equally interesting",coursereport
2612,Codeworks,2021-02-08,"Just finished Codeworks a month ago and landed a Developer job after two weeks. What I have to say is: it just depend you yourself and how much you want to learn and grow. I can say I have learned A LOT from Codeworks. Not only how to write code but mostly how code works, data structures, algorithms, system architecture, writing clean and good code. The instructors were great and were always pushing us to learn more and more. The Junior part is really hard, exercises are not easy, but you will learn a lot (as long as you put in the effort), and the Senior part will make your portfolio to show when you apply for jobs, and will also give you a chance to apply what you have learn and also experience working on a group. All I can say is that it depends on yourself. If you are really focused on becoming a good developer, Codeworks will be an amazing experience, but if you're not really interested in learning and don't put in the effort, it's not worth it. For me it was really worth it.",coursereport
2613,Codeworks,2019-05-26,"I waited a bit before writing my review as I had taken some time off before applying: I needed to make up my mind on where I wanted to live, which role, etc. I had therefore little visibility on how I would perform compared to the rest of the ""market"". Currently I am a full-stack developer working in London for clients as a contractor. I am now in the position to attest that the things we learned and the depth of our knowledge in Javascript and software development in general is really, really good. If you're skeptical about whether those months can take you to a professional level, please, know that it really will. You'll get much more than just knowledge in web development. You'll get the right fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, etc), which makes a whole difference on your approach when you'll start building things: you'll be able to judge the efficiency and quality of a given code. Warning - before coming to CW, you do need to learn and code as much as you can. As others have pointed out, in the end of the day, you will have to do the work. So you might struggle if you haven't prepared properly before the program. Really take the pre-course exercises seriously, and start learning on your own now. The TAs are really patient and helpful, it really speeds up your learning by ten times compared to if you were on your own. Not to mention the rest of the students. I met the most brilliant minds. I urgently recommend if you're serious about becoming a full-stack / front-end / software engineer.",coursereport
2614,Codeworks,2024-11-23,"I did this course after finishing a degree in Computer Science, I was looking for a way to accelerate my proficiency in web development quickly and jump to higher roles. Codeworks does an excellent job in making sure everyone has a strong baseline for coding and computer science principles before entry through their admissions process. This then allows them to take everyone from a good level to a great level quickly. Their curriculum covered a lot of the basics and fundamentals while also giving real and tangible skills for a professional role. The projects you do while on the course are excellent to demonstrate your skill and the tutor support which is always ready whenever you request it is excellent. Finally their process of preparing you for applying to roles in the field, getting your interview skills ready, CV looking clean and ready and finally a guide and process for applying to jobs makes it much easier to find a job even in a tough market.",coursereport
2615,Codeworks,2024-09-10,"The instructors are incredibly dedicated. The curriculum is up to date. Yes, you need to dedicate yourself for sure, but it's 100% worth it. Thanks to all the instructors and staff. The job career center is amazing.",coursereport
2616,Codeworks,2024-09-04,"I joined Codeworks to pursue my dream of becoming a Software Engineer. I made a thorough research, and inspected curriculums of the bootcamps that were available in Germany. The one of Codeworks turned out to be the most extensive, and I chose Codeworks. In order to be admitted you need to prepare and pass a technical interview, which is not easy. Learning at Codeworks was very challenging, hard, but rewarding. I couldn’t believe how much I learned in just 3 months. I landed a job in a month after completing the course, and my interviewers were surprised how much a fresh graduate knows. I recommend Codeworks because they know what they are doing, you just need to trust them and work hard, absorbing all this wisdom.",coursereport
2617,Codeworks,2024-08-08,"With an academic background in the humanities, I initially approached technology from that perspective before deciding to pursue software engineering. I had some experience with coding and, along with my partner (a software engineer), explored various bootcamp options available in Europe. I spoke with different institutions, read experience reports from past attendees, and gathered all the information I could. A month later, I chose Codeworks for their immersive software engineering program focused on full-stack development in JavaScript/TypeScript, and I have no regrets. From the acceptance test and pre-course to the actual course (divided into junior and senior phase), I am happy with everything they offered. The pre-course ensured we all started with a shared foundation, which was further built upon in the junior phase with more theory and challenges. The senior phase supported our growth the most, featuring three projects that culminated in a group thesis project. Within this intensive and focused environment, Codeworks also managed to communicate the values of clean code and testing. However, Codeworks didn't stop there. They supported us throughout the job-hunting process. I was unfamiliar with the unique challenges of applying for tech jobs and might not have managed as well without Mireia from Codeworks. I had no trouble finding a job, and part of this success is maybe due to the information and context Codeworks provided, especially since, in my previous academic roles, I never had to navigate the multi-step job application process that is common in tech. Regarding the time commitment and intensity of the bootcamp, it's essential to note that it is a demanding experience. You can review the curriculum and daily structure on their website, which includes lectures, pair programming, challenges, meetings, and projects. The three months of the actual course, excluding the self-paced pre-course, will dominate your life. However, I personally think it is worth it. Committing to building skills in a short time frame allows you to overcome feelings of frustration and possible breaking points faster. Now, to tell you what I was most interested in before I decided for a coding bootcamp: after working as a software developer for quite some time, I can confidently say that I recommend Codeworks. I, for one, needed the structure and community as well as the opportunity to ask questions to be able to learn coding as fast as I did. I feel comfortable in my job and get (very) good feedback. Everybody knows about my learning experience through the bootcamp and nobody is questioning my knowledge. I would do it again.",coursereport
2618,Codeworks,2024-07-23,"I recently completed the Software Engineering program at Codeworks, and I'm tremendously impressed.

The project you they make you do are very useful in the job search. The pre-course allows you to reach 20% alone, learning the basics so you can spend the 3 months of course getting as far ahead as possible, compared to other bootcamps that waste you time by teaching you the very simple basics. Cons: Some of the instructors in MY cohort did not have enough experience to be excellent teachers the cost can be prohibitive for some people (even though i consider them really worth it) The course is 12h a day, 6 days a week.

2630,Codeworks,2023-01-03,"In this review I want to touch on three main parts: How Codeworks has changed/improved my life The REALITY of Codeworks The Outcomes (job support) team Before I get into this let me start with what is most important that is that THEY DO DELIVER ON WHAT THEY PROMISE: Finding a job as a Software Engineer within few months of graduation. The exact time that it will take you (1, 2 or 3 months or even more) will completely depend on how much work you put into finding a job. If you follow all of the instructions that you get during job support you will probably be able to find a job within a month or month and a half max. If you decide to go on your own pace, and do your own thing it will obviously take you longer. How Codeworks has changed/improved my life - Attending Codeworks has probably been the best decision I have ever taken, not only did I become a much better developer and get a satisfying job offer but the course itself is so challenging that truly prepares you to struggle and constantly be uncomfortable in your future career. Now don’t get me wrong it does not mean that you will never struggle again after Codeworks but after the course you will be much more comfortable finding yourself in uncomfortable situations, and it will come much easier and feel much more possible to learn difficult topics. You will have a degree of autonomy that you did not have before the course. 2. The Reality of Codeworks - this is very important to understand as it will prepare you for the course. Codeworks is no magic pill, that is you won’t just magically become a good software engineer. You will have to work as hard as you ever have and try and deliver tasks within unrealistic amount of time. You will most likely struggle like you never have. Luckily for you you will have support from very talented instructors that will help you understand the material but you will still be expected to show a certain degree of autonomy in delivering the given tasks. Codeworks also provides an amazing learning environment: You will be surrounded by some of the smartest people that you will ever meet, your classmates, who have similar ambitions to yours. What is important to understand is that your improvement as a Software Engineer during the course does not just depend on Codeworks but also on how hard you work. 3. The Outcomes Team: The job support that you get from the outcomes team is so good that it deserves a section of its own. In my opinion the job support alone, is worth all the money that the course costs. And the best part of it all is that you get it for the rest of your life. At least from my experience, the strategies and knowledge that is shared with you in order to optimize your chances of finding a job worked like a charm. You have a counselor dedicated to making you look like the strongest and best possible candidate. Now of course if you do not follow all of the suggestions that are given to you it won’t work as well so I highly recommend listening to their suggestions.",coursereport
2631,Codeworks,2022-11-15,"Codeworks is an intensive course with an amazing curriculum. You learn concepts from top to bottom on both frontend and backend topics.

2633,Codeworks,2021-05-14,"I attended this coding bootcamp in Berlin. One big plus is that the programme doesn't start from zero. You need to pass some coding tests and assignments to get accepted there - that means you need some prior coding experience. The programme is really well structured and it covers topics like advanced JavaScrip, data structures, databases, testing and frameworks like Angular, React and Node.js. You will finish the bootcamp with two personal projects - one coded alone and one within a team. The codeworks staff is really friendly and extremely helpful. One of the most positive aspect is a career support at the end of the programme. They will do some tech interview training with you and help setting up your github and linkedIn profile. Additionally they have some really helpful tips regarding the job search and the whole application process. I am really happy that I did codeworks - it was challenging and at lot of work but in the end it all paid off. I learned a lot during the course and I found a job within 3 weeks after graduation.",coursereport
2634,Codeworks,2021-01-26,"During the first part of the course they taught us a lot of new technologies, while still giving us the time to do exercises and understand them. In the second part we had to make three different projects, so that we could expand our knowledge of the technologies we most liked while simultaneously building our portfolio. At the end they helped us build our CV and LinkedIn profile, and helped us practice with interviews. During the exercises and two of the projects we also worked with other people which is great to learn how to work in a team. All around it has been a great experience with the only counterpoint being that it's very hard, mainly because of the fact that it is Monday to Saturday, from 9 am to 9 pm for three months, which can be very exhausting, but extremely worth it. I found a job just after two weeks from the end of the course, so i would definitely recommend it to anyone that has the time for it.",coursereport
2635,Codeworks,2020-11-22,Definitely the best way to learn how to code! The instructors have a very good level and helps you to learn how everything works under the hood. The bootcamp is really demanding and that's the best way to learn a lot in a short period of time. I definitely recomend it!,coursereport

2637,Codeworks,2024-05-09,"During my time in Codeworks' Software Engineering Immersive course, I truly felt my growth and progress. Over the span of three months, I not only learned the JavaScript language but, more importantly, I mastered core concepts like data structures and algorithms, as well as skills in front-end, back-end, and databases. It was an incredibly challenging journey, but it's these challenges that shaped me into a stronger programmer. I learned how to tackle complex problems, collaborate effectively with teams, and maintain composure and focus under pressure. This course wasn't just a technical learning experience; it was a comprehensive journey of personal growth, for which I am deeply grateful.",coursereport
2638,Codeworks,2024-02-28,I hade a great experience at Codeworks:- the curriculum was well structured and thought out. - I could learn a lot from the instructors as well as from the other participants. - I think one of the best part of the course is the job search support.,coursereport
2639,Codeworks,2023-11-15,"The bootcamp is pretty intense. A lot of hours and it goes fast. It doesn't go deep on anything but it gives you the tools to do it on your own. It is a lot of money but if you are in Germany you can go with the Bildungsgutschein and then it is totally worth it. I would advise to learn to code on your own before joining because of the fast pace. I've seen colleagues struggling with frameworks because they didn't deeply understand the basics. Not because the basics are not explained, but because it is too fast to absorb everything. Nevertheless, it delivers what it promises: 5 weeks after graduation I got a job as a full stack developer. Two of my colleagues also got a job in that time frame. All of us had some previous experience in the industry. The support they give you after graduation to find the job is really good. They help you to tweek your CV to get more interviews and the do a weekly follow up to check what is working and what is not. I would have loved to learn about Clean Architechture and not only go through the surface of the MVC pattern.",coursereport

The program was well-structured, with a meticulous curriculum tailored to give students the tools and knowledge necessary for the real world of coding. The educators were not only knowledgeable but incredibly supportive, ensuring that each student grasped the concepts being taught. I came into the bootcamp with expectations and left with them greatly surpassed.",coursereport
2641,Codeworks,2023-04-20,"Very intense course. The curriculum prepares you well, and the course is for the most part well organized.

Some instructors are themselves fresh graduates of the program...",coursereport

2643,Codeworks,2023-01-20,Being part of Codeworks changed my life. I learnt a lot about programming and they gave me the tools and good practices so that I have a better understanding on how the code works and what is best to do. Before Codeworks I felt really insecure about my programming skills but the bootcamp really boost up my confidence. The instructors are great (if you're online EST Santi is super open to help and he really does know his stuff) as well as the job assistance. Finding a job can be frustrating and there were times when I thought it was better to give it a break but the team's advices really helped me out and the tips where key to find a job that is so much better than my old one.,coursereport
2644,Codeworks,2022-07-18,"After 3 months of intense learning, I can definitely say that this course was worth it. Found myself an awesome job in a Fintech startup and couldn't be happier. Not only is the curriculum spot on, but the instructors are super attentive and helpful. After you graduate there is an incredible amount of advice to help you on your job search. I actually miss being a student now! The timetable of the course is well structured and you'll be learning alongside equally motivated students which I've made great friends with. The community of graduates is awesome and that is a huge benefit to help you as a developer. I would say this course is for career changers with a strong interest in coding but feels stuck in their current job and can't get enough free time outside of work to study coding. I've saved up enough money for the course and a few months afterwards for the job search and it was absolutely the right decision and would highly recommend!",coursereport

This was after the JS pre-course, admissions interview, tech interview and the project I spent so much time on over the holidays. Very disappointed in the manner in which they treated me. I suggest finding a course that has it together and will be upfront with you from the beginning. I do not recommend! Also if you do decide to waste your time I would advise waiting until they have up to date statistics about job placement as they don't have those statistics for the remote course online.",coursereport

It's super intense - 70 hours a week, and requires commitment and motivation. I was lucky that my cohort was a great group of people and that is something that helps the experience. It has definitely changed my life - I got a job as a web developer and I'm loving it.",coursereport
2647,Digital career institute,2025-01-12,"Nearly a year after graduating, few classmates have secured jobs—and, frankly, it’s not surprising. The teaching quality was poor, with outdated resources that failed to reflect current marketing trends. It felt like DCI was unwilling to invest in modern tools and essential industry programs, which are crucial in today’s market. Lessons were often limited to basic slide shows and PowerPoint presentations rather than practical, hands-on learning experiences. The school seems to have a poor reputation. Unfortunately, I ignored the negative reviews and hoped for something better, which turned out to be a mistake. The fact that the school is funded by the job center likely explains its lack of quality and commitment to students’ futures.",coursereport
2648,Digital career institute,2025-01-11,"The day I asked my React teacher a question about the subject he was teaching and saw only confusion and doubt in his eyes, I knew that choosing this school had been a huge mistake. Everything was going “fine” as he read the information he had on his slides/powerpoints. As soon as questions come up, they don't know how to answer, they divert the conversation, they say “later, later” but the later never comes... I have some Web Dev basics like HTLM and CSS, but I feel sorry for my colleagues who have no basics at all and have to go through classes like this. Absolutely unacceptable.",coursereport
2649,Digital career institute,2024-05-16,"They give you fake promises about job opportunities and support. Never before have I encountered such a toxic positivity environment. Only one programming teacher was capable of teaching effectively, while others struggled with basic coding problems. It was horrific to listen to some of the teachers who barely had English skills. After making some complaints, they would tell you that everything is fine and that you shouldn't be worried.I am writing this opinion to prevent people from making a wrong decision. Without my determination, I wouldn't be able to code now. All my peers, including myself, bought additional Udemy courses to follow best practices and acquire the knowledge that was supposed to be provided by DCI. If you want to study programming, choose a rare programming language and the best programming school.",coursereport

While DCI has some room for improvement, I'm very happy with the content prepared for us and my biggest highlight is my teacher Bena Roberts. She's one of the most dedicated, professional people I've encountered. She made this learning experience enriching and kept us motivated no matter what challenges came. I do have to mention that the career success team has been quite disappointing (with the exception of Ulrike’s workshops), I really hope DCI can take a good look at the way things are done and make a serious improvement there. In summary, I would definitely recommend the Salesforce course for anyone interested in an IT career, and DCI is a good way to start but you need to also have self motivation to move your career further.",coursereport
2655,Digital career institute,2024-01-18,"This review is about the 12 month Web Developer course. It was an awful and exhausting experience. The teachers could not teach. It's as simple as that. I believe they had their knowledge but they couldn't pass it to us because they knew nothing about how to be a teacher. We complained for many months about this and the school couldn't care less. The so called ""class managers"" couldn't do more than ""it will get better, we will look into this, don't worry, thank you for your feedback"". We fell into desperation, we literally had to scream to be heard, until something in them woke up and said ""oh maybe there is actually something very wrong here"". We wasted months of our lifes with a teacher that was not able in any sense to teach us something. Bad communication, lack of preparation, not even thinking of preparing a lesson before starting it. The curriculum seemed ok and interesting, but it was impossible to do something with it. Most of my class ended up buying extra courses online or paying tutors so we could at least learn something for real. Then, after a long battle, we arrive at the job search moment and the job coaches and managers don't help with anything. It's been disappointment after disappointment with this school. Everything in this school feels like a cash grab and they found a gold mine in state support. Stay away. Look for another school. And trust the bad reviews, more than anything, trust the bad reviews, please. I was a fool not to do it in the first place, because I read a few but at the same time thought ""it could't be that bad, right? And there is some positive reviews too, right?"". Stay away. Learn by yourself even. Anything is better than DCI.",coursereport

I don't have much to add. If I could I would give it a zero. It's so bad. And this behavior of trying to silence valid opinions is just horrific. Maybe you should try to improve your services, teachears and curriculum, not silence those who still try to give an honest opinion so that you can see your mistakes. Learn, DCI, learn!",coursereport
2665,Digital career institute,2025-01-14,"I will begin by saying that I genuinely liked some of the instructors as people, and that I deeply feel sorry that they have to teach in a school so bad equipped to support its students and teachers. The curriculum plan isn't bad either, but everything else is a huge failure. The instructors, as much as they wanted to do their best, were put to teach classes on subjects they had not mastered and it was excruciating to watch. We didn't learn anything in months and had to dedicate ourselves to external sites like Udemy (paying for it). Then teachers were replaced and disappeared without any explanation. The job search support is a joke and I won't even mention the hours wasted with ""job coaches"" who I honestly don't know how they got there. At one point it felt like it was in some sort of cult about the ""coach"" philosophy. It was this bad. Terrible. Like... what authority do these people have to say so many banalities, get paid for it, without clearly being interested in whether we get a job or not? The help was zero.",coursereport
2666,Digital career institute,2024-12-22,"My experience with DCI was horrible—not because the teacher couldn’t code, but because everything surrounding it made it one of the worst learning experiences of my life! Here are the highlights: 1. Contract Violations and Lack of ConfidentialityWe signed a contract stating we couldn’t use racist, offensive, or sexual language. However, when students violated this, the response was shocking. For instance, when someone reported sexual harassment, instead of maintaining confidentiality, the teacher exposed the affected student in front of the entire class. Worse, the student who reported this received no protection afterwards. Over the course of a year, those who adhered to the contract were bullied, silenced, and targeted during class, often by a single bully.I’m not overly sensitive, and I don’t think the occasional inappropriate joke is the end of the world. But witnessing this was disheartening. DCI essentially supported a bully who sexually harassed others in class and went after anyone trying to protect the victim. The teachers and management failed miserably to handle this.The irony? Students were required to complete soft skills and diversity/inclusion training—while DCI itself demonstrated none of these values. 2. Favoritism and NepotismThe teacher fostered a toxic environment by favoring two out of 15 students. Unsurprisingly, these were the only ones offered internships through DCI’s partner companies. The rest of the class was left to fend for themselves, realizing the job coach and DCI had no real intention of helping anyone else. 3. Retaliation for Speaking UpWhenever someone raised concerns with management, things only worsened. It quickly became clear that staying silent and enduring the bullying or any other issue was the safest option. The teacher ignored blatant harassment during classes and project presentation, creating a toxic environment where students were expected to pretend that soft skills and diversity classes weren’t a complete farce. 4. A Demoralized ClassAfter six months, the teacher complained in front of the class that no one, except their favorite two students, wanted to present their exercises.Of course, no one wanted to participate. In an environment where harassment was tolerated and complaints ignored, it’s no wonder students felt demoralized. Nobody wanted to waste energy engaging with a system that clearly didn’t care about them. 5. Fake Reviews from Employees on GoogleI was shocked when DCI’s overall Google rating dropped to 3.6 stars—only for it to suddenly bounce back to 4.0 stars overnight. A staggering 50 reviews were submitted in a single night. Upon checking the names, I noticed that most of them were employees I personally knew from DCI. It was clear they were trying to bury the genuine negative reviews under a flood of fake positive ones. Some of them were reported and taken down by Google, but not enough to reflect the real rating from students. This is a trick from the DCI to not drop under 3.5 for SEO reasons. But this seems to be normal practice. Do not believe the good reviews. They could've been made by an employee! Last but not least:I joined DCI to upskill, coming in with strong qualifications and extensive experience at one of the world’s most successful SaaS companies. I was the only one in my class to secure a job immediately after the course—without any help from DCI. Everyone else was left floundering, shocked by how little DCI cared. The job coach was dismissive and unhelpful, treating everyone like children and blaming them for not improving their CVs. In my case, the coach seemed weirdly unhappy that I succeeded without DCI’s help. When I tried to share advice with my peers, she deliberately ignored me, even when other students expressed interest in my input.During one session, I raised my hand multiple times to contribute but was blatantly overlooked—three times in a row—while others were called on. When I send her private messages with questions, which was the communication she preferred, she simply ignored me and my question. I asked how I should proceed since I have a job. So nothing out of this world. This level of unprofessionalism just tells you everything. My Verdict:Avoid DCI. While some teachers are competent, the overall experience is dreadful. You will never know, who you will end up with. The rampant unprofessionalism, lack of support, and toxic environment overshadow any potential benefits. Companies don’t trust DCI certificates or curricula, and it’s clear why: the institution fails to practice what it preaches. Why would you receive any professional learning experience and prepare you for the real world if they themselves display such unprofessionalism. Think about it.",coursereport

2668,Digital career institute,2023-08-17,"this was the worst school I had ever attended. Do you like uncaring bureaucracy then go to this school. If you have a teacher that doesn't care about the class and does not do his job and you report him the school will gas-light you. Many people in my class complained about our teacher and the school would say no one else is complaining not knowing we are all sharing are reports on WhatsApp. I think this school could get shut down if they don't change. One person in my class went to the head offices with agents from the job center and they tried to gaslight the job center agents too, and I heard the job center agents where pissed off. Does learning German once a week for 6 hours sound effective to you? They promised to change the language classes and one year later everything is the same. How about getting interview training from a temp who never read the material? Bad staff, bad teachers, bad curriculum, and bad class structure. Do another bootcamp",coursereport

The lectures are a great mix of the intuition of the algorithms and the math behind it. At the same time you learn everything practically by doing coding exercises. The course will be easier to master if you have a strong background in statistics, but even participants without it have accomplished a great deal. In regards to finding a job afterwards, you obviously can't expect wonders after a 3 months course, but it definitely helped me a lot to get a desirable role.

2676,neuefische,2020-12-21,"Attending the Neue Fische WebDev Bootcamp in cologne was one of the best decisions I made this year! I got into coding about a year ago when I started to think about a career change. One year later and thanks to my wonderful coaches Leon and Phillip I'm on the verge of being a Bootcamp graduate. I won't be lying: Attending the Bootcamp is going to be hard. The first weeks you dream about code and all the coding problems ou are not able to wok out. But after a few more weeks you will be able to solve problems you thought were unsolvable. I wasn't sure what to think about attending a remote Bootcamp at first. After the first few weeks, I was able to see massive benefits. We were able to solve problems by sharing screens and I believe your concentration was more focused on your doings. Even social interactions between students where great. Every Friday we had an ""after-work"" event where we played a lot of scribble, talked and had a lot of fun. We even had a ""digitaler 11.11"" where some of us dressed up and we had a little digital party. After 8 weeks of intensive learning in our digital classes, we started preparing our ""Digitales Gesellenstück"" (the Capstone project). Those 4 following weeks gave me time to apply all concepts we learned earlier. In this time there was always the option to get help from the coaches and the whole community.

The employee responsible was more focused on the Hamburg students. I give 4 stars because the coaches filled the gap.

2678,neuefische,2020-07-13,"Instructors and the Cohort I participated the data science boot camp in a group of 16 participants. After my studies 3 years earlier I did not expect it to be that hard. After the first week we knew why it is called a boot camp. The instructors did a great job in shaping the environment of the group so that it was a collaborative experience. The predominant driver of this boot camp is peer pressure - but not in a competitive fashion. The instructors gave us the feeling that we are in this together and that together we are stronger. Every attendee had some tasks from time to time and none would want to let the group down. Learning Scope The scope is quite large. The order of the course has a well designed structure. The course is focused on programming labs. We had 2 one week projects and a 4 week capstone project in the end. These projects helped a lot in training through repetition without feeling like repetition. I have the small critique that deep learning could be more fleshed out and I would have liked to learn something about reinforcement learning. Job Assistance We had various job sessions with advice for an entry into the field of data science or IT in general. Neue fische also works with partners that seek for applicants. From time to time those partners introduce themselves to the cohort. In general neue fische encourages networking.

2679,neuefische,2020-07-10,"Especially in Germany it's still somehow experimental to choose that kind of alternative education. The most of developers I got to know so far, have a bachelor degree. But I heard also, that you're not necessarily learning to code in university – for bachelor students it's as well kind of a by-product. And I didn't want to develop the next computer, I don't need to know ALL the theory behind the practice. I just wanted to learn how to build websites. And I did it. It was quit a turning point in my resume. Coming from theatre and literature, the only thing I brought along was a sense for structures. I learned everything else in that bootcamp. Sure, it's hard to learn something from scratch within two months and than write your first web-application within 4 weeks. But that's exactly what I was looking for: results and something happening. I would say the thing that helped me most getting started at neue fische, was the atmosphere there. From day one, it's clearly pointed out, that it's challenging – but they care for you in the same way: Have you drunk enough water? Do you have any questions? They make frequently breaks in order to recover, there is a fridge with free drinks etc. And on top of that, they got a strong awareness policy. Should be standard in 21st century, but it's still a pleasure to experience as normal together. Last but not least: Yeah, it's coding. Numbers and variables the whole day long, looking for the needle in a haystack.

2681,neuefische,2022-02-03,"I completed the bootcamp a couple of weeks ago and I found it super helpful and a good starting point to change your professional path into the direction of everything to do with data science. Will you know everything about data science after only 3 month? No, of course not, but you get a solid foundation and be able to build on that within your next role. And I'm still impressed what I learned and achieved in this relatively short amount of time. If you are worried about if it is too much or you need to know a lot about statistics, as I was a bit: yes, it is a lot, and it definitely helps if you have a background in natural science or similar, like a field that uses statistical methods. Also it helps if you used UNIX before. And yes, the bootcamp is intense, but it can be done. You get a lot of support from the coaches, you just have to ask. They are super friendly and take the time to find solutions and are also willing to change the approach even during the bootcamp if you just let them know. For us, sometimes we felt a bit overwhelmed, but the learning by doing approach that is practiced during the course is good. Also, you have all of your fellow bootcamp students to talk to and (at least in my team) everyone was helpful and we had a great atmosphere. It helped that people came from different backgrounds in my opinion, and I was sad that during the pandemic we only met remote. The bootcamp also helped me to get the position that I wanted. Luckily, I was able to do the course via the unemployment agency, otherwise it would have been too expensive for me. So, in summary, for me, it was definitely worth the work and the time that I invested and I would do it again.",coursereport

2683,neuefische,2024-04-09,"In 2023, I attended a 12-week online UX/UI Bootcamp. Unfortunately, Neue Fische was a bad choice. They seem to prioritize acquiring new students and generating more revenue. What was good about it: The coaches were friendly. They provided MacBooks for students during the bootcamp. The pace was challenging. What I didn't like: There was far too little personal feedback, which should be a significant part of such a bootcamp. Otherwise, you could take courses on other platforms. After finishing the capstone project, you don’t receive ANY FEEDBACK. During the capstone phase, it was possible to sign up for consultations with coaches, but there were not enough slots for everyone. For one small project, we waited more than a week for feedback and received only a simple checklist without any detailed comments. They advertise 12 weeks of bootcamp, but in reality, it's only 9 weeks. During the last 3 weeks, you work alone on your capstone project without any lectures. The first 30 minutes of every morning were spent alone without coaches. It was supposed to be a time to discuss our problems/questions among ourselves. Then, we spent the next 15–30 minutes with coaches discussing the day's plan and playing some team-building games. The career service is not helpful, as there are only a few companies available. The partner companies are not helpful either. The graduation event is just for fun; nobody will pick you up. Our head coach was on holiday during the first 2 weeks. Sometimes, when you had questions, coaches didn’t want to help and suggested asking other participants for assistance. The coaches were not up to date with all the new features in Figma, so I had to watch YouTube tutorials. I don’t know how they claim to have a high employment rate after bootcamps because nobody contacted me afterward to inquire if I got a job. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THE UX/UI BOOTCAMP if you're aiming to secure a job in this field. You would be better off investing your money in courses on Coursera or Udemy.",coursereport
2684,neuefische,2023-07-18,"The Course Content was good, and the Lecturers highly attentive. That's all the positives I can say. The course is very expensive if the employment office don't pay for you, so don't bother paying for it with your own money. You would be better off investing 10% of that into coursera or udemy courses. Something that makes me bitter about the course is the marketing about partner companies and high employment rates after the bootcamps. Firstly, the partnerships are nothing more than a contact with an HR representative. The careers services personnel are incompetent and the only thing they can actually do is slow down your application process. Just apply directly to companies because you won't receive any better service with the careers team. I recommend they are all fired. My normal experience with recruitment personnel is that they are trying desperately to find you a job so that they get their commission. With Neue Fische staff, it took [name redacted] 2 months just to reply to an interest I had in a partner company. And the reply was just to say they were no longer taking applicants, even though the partner had open positions or their website. Then with regards to the ""high employment rate"". What they fail to mention is that those employment rates have nothing to do with the course. 90% employment rates after the bootcamp? but they fail to mention that those people could be getting jobs as baristas. I finished my course 4 months ago and not a single student has been able to get a Data Science job. The careers services team also give absolutely no guidance on how you could improve yourself after the bootcamp, to make yourself more sellable to companies. But why would you expect them to?? I've already explained why they are nothing more than a money drain to the Neue Fische scam to bleed money from the employment office. So Highlights.

Things which can be improved: Since it is a very personal experience and it very much depends on everyone's self, I still think that the BootCamp can be a bit more intense.

My motivation to take the SPICED Data Science Bootcamp was to brush up my Python programming skills and to learn the current data science methods in hands on projects. I had already some self taught experience in python, but was not confident enough in my programming skills to use them in my projects. The bootcamp changed that! Each week brought a new project with increased difficulty level that often seemed impossible to achieve at first, but with ceaseless help of the teachers and full time commitment every hurdle could be taken. The curriculum included a variety of data science methods and the mathematical theory to go with it. Because of the big number of topics, it was often not possible to explore everything in depth. However students were encouraged to focus on specific fields they were interested in and neglect others. Also, by design, every challenge was a team effort. There was no toxic behaviour and cooperation was always encouraged by the SPICED team. The teachers often went out of the way to help with bug-fixing or explanations of complex topics.

2701,Spiced academy,2021-11-30,"My time at Spiced Academy was a super career-reset. After making the tough decision of a career switch during the pandemic, there was also choosing the right school. I read online about bootcamps in Berlin and they always mentioned that it can be a nerve cracking experience if you are not mentally prepared and highly motivated. I had already decided about Full Stack Web Development after discussing with friends in the field and online research. I believe the curriculum at Spiced was well-organized and structured. As I was a bit nervous naturally, I prefered the duration of 12 weeks instead of the more common 9 week bootcamps. In addition, an appealing website always helps to attract students, especially if they want to become a web developer. It definitely had an effect on me and made the decision easier. If eligible, one should definitely utilize the Bildungsgutschein from the Arbeitsagentür. The admission process was a good way to learn about the school and get some basic preparation. The home assignment during admission already gives you a good idea about yourself and whether you are ready for such an intensive bootcamp. Once the bootcamp started, there was no time to look back. We were thoroughly engaged with learning and our home tasks everyday. It was nice to have fellow course mates from various backgrounds. We slowly got to know our friendly and very helpful teachers day by day. They each had their own style but also a common aim, to get the topics into our heads! During the pandemic, studying remotely was a new experience for both sides and Spiced handled it quite well. It was a good balance between lectures, assignments and consultation. The course also had a seemless flow starting with JavaScript, HTML, CSS for the front end; shifting to the back end with Node/Express, PostgreSQL, etc.; getting introduced to frameworks like Vue & React and finally moving onto the real projects. While working on the projects I had realized I have already made considerable progress. Each project was different and exciting to do, as we could include our own ideas and creativity. That always helped to open our minds and broaden our perspectives. Finally, before we knew it, it was time to submit our final project and graduate. The intensity made the 3 months feel like it flew by. We were ready to create our portfolio, resume and online presence as job-seekers. Spiced career consultation helped a lot to achieve them, even after we had graduated. There were career talks/discussions throughout the bootcamp. In addition, the hiring department was always actively searching for prospective employers for Spiced graduates. Both career counselling and hiring department from Spiced supported to push towards the job market and give confidence while applying to jobs myself. Thankfully I was able to land my first job within a couple of months as a Frontend Developer in Berlin. Till date we are still connected to the Spiced network, old and new students. The time at Spiced will be a very memorable experience forever. I would highly recommend Spiced Academy for anybody looking to change their careers, no matter what background you come from; have an awesome/priceless brainwash and get ready for the tech industry within 3 months!",coursereport
2702,Spiced academy,2021-11-26,"I did the course after quitting my job as I really wanted to be a Developer for around 2 years. So my decision involved a lot of research in advance because it wouldn't be an easy way either. After multiple talks and invitations at different providers, I quickly wanted to be part of SPICED. My personal reasons for that were primarily the curriculum --> modern frameworks, a lot of JS and working on/creating multiple projects each week to really have something of your own work to show after graduating. That was quite helpful for my applications afterwards. Also, it shouldn't be too general and easy - at another provider I needed to simply change colors in css and got the course acception based on that. Idk, you think about the level of the whole course then right? If you have few experience before, you need to learn so much to even start in that job anyways. My recommendation is learning the basics before and use the bootcamp for getting deeper into understanding. If you see yourself in my review so far, SPICED is the absolute best way to do this. :) I'm not gonna lie, it was very challenging and exhausting. I thought I cannot make it so often. But it was the best way to learn quite a lot in a very short time. You get a great overview of different Frontend and Backend projects what can also be helpful for focussing just in one field afterwards. Biggest props at this point to our outstanding teacher Florian! I really think that he was the best part of the whole bootcamp. Patient, funny, very good at explaining, always helpful and positive on anything especially when you are deeply frustrated :') It took some time and still a lot of work after graduation, but I'm an employed Full Stack Web Developer now and would do it anytime again with SPICED.",coursereport

The graduation project was a Projektei of our choice with a framework of our choice. 10 graduation project was actually the most fun, because it was the first time you really saw what you learned in practice. While going through the different topics there were really interesting job search workshops in between, , preparing you for the later job search. They also help you with the whole hiring process and get you a accustomed to Tech interviews. What really stood out was the community behind spiced Academy. All people are really engaged to help you and I’m still grasping opportunities via slack and the different channels and events they do for graduates. If I had to decide again I Would totally Do the camp again. It is a really good starting point to get deeper into web development, if you already have grasped the basics.

I still can not believe but I found a position just after 2 months of finishing my Bootcamp, first as an intern and now as an FE engineer in the same company. Bootcamp is quite intense but all teachers in Spiced are quite helpful and so supportive. Whenever I felt bad or under pressure, they really made their best to make me believe again that I can learn to code. Bootcamp is officially 3 months but with the prep period (Spiced is providing some links/platforms so that you can learn basics for CSS/HTML/JS/SQL for the Bootcamp and pass the assignment), I would say I spent almost 5 months for Spiced. I strongly recommend investing good time in the prep especially if you have no background/ experience in coding. The curriculum is quite packed and intense but at the same time great for the industry.

The course was indeed intensive, but I completed every project in the end and had a lot of fun. The teachers are good at what they do. The career coaching is super helpful. I'm glad about my decision and will definitely recommend it to friends. Application: Don't be afraid of this 60-hour prep course and the assessment. The course is just a review of university math (Calculus, Linear Algebra and Statistics), some introductory reading, and basic Python codes. If you have a programming background, it doesn't take that much time at all. If you don't, it is easy to catch up with the learning material. The assessment is writing a Python program regarding simple math problems. This is not a graded exam. You will receive a comment with suggestions from the teachers. During the Course: The course is mainly about Machine Learning (incl. Deep Learning). There are also projects about SQL, AWS, Docker, and software engineering. Meanwhile, topics like coding style, testing and web application will be mentioned as well. The bootcamp can be on-site or online, depending on which city you live in. You will stay in front of the computer for at least 10 hours a day, and the brain work will get you hungry sooner than usual. Remember to relax and keep exercising during the bootcamp. → Don't break your eyes, back or neck. :P All course material is online, which means you have full access even after the bootcamp. There are mandatory lessons and extra lessons for self-learning. The teachers may add them in the course depending on the schedule and students' learning speed, or upon requests. A weekly project involves many relevant topics. The target and steps are usually listed in the beginning. You'll receive the tools from the teachers and apply them one by one. On Friday afternoon, everyone will give a lightning talk about their work of the week or some other interesting topics from their exploration during the week. This is the relaxing moment of the week. Career Coaching: After the class (once a week), there are online career sessions about job functions, CV & cover letter, LinkedIn, interviews, salary negotiation, job search strategies, etc. There you will meet students from other cohorts. No matter how many applications you may have written, you could always learn a new point or two. For academics and fresh graduates, it will be a fundamental instruction of job searching. You could also book private coaching sessions with the professionals to discuss individual cases or for a revision of your CV/cover letter. The career sessions are also offered after graduation. Graduation: In the last week, you will come up with your own project idea and use what you've learned to realize it. The teachers are there to help. It will be an exciting challenge, and it helps you to get a feeling of real work. You will present your project online on the last Friday in front of 40/50 audiences. In the end, you will only find that 12 weeks are not enough, you want to learn more. But at this point, you are actually more capable than you think because you can already solve so many problems in your life! The final project is proof. This bootcamp is a fast and ensured path to start your data career.",coursereport

That would be worrying as so much of the experience would be lost, or so I thought.. SPICED adapted incredibly well, and the instructors were beyond incredible. My entrance exam was returned to me after the first attempt because I didn't know the difference between a return and a console.log (except that they show different colors on the browser). Today I feel like that was years ago and not just 12 weeks. Spiced will keep you up in front of your screen 10-14 hours a day. You will dream code and you will have breakdowns but not once did I feel alone or lost.. The light at the end of the tunnel seemed faint at first but if you push, SPICED will get you there.. I think the biggest positive (and this might be a negative to some) there is no hand-holding. There is guidance, it will seem vague at first but when you pick a new library and can read the documentation and think for yourself the feeling of accomplishment is overwhelming.

I will start with the positives: David is a very experienced instructor in coding and even some of the frameworks/materials are slightly dated versus what I have seen since starting as a developer, I am almost certain it is impossible to stay 100% current at the pace things change. The materials and information are highly focused and I think you are taken on a deep dive through older frameworks jQuery that then gives some insight into the current state of affairs. I might shift more of the curriculum towards the frameworks, structuring of applications and software development best practices around Github/workflow, but there is no way for a 12 week curriculum to do anything but give you a taste of most things and not exposure. Classroom flow was very positive and asking questions there was the move. Read all lectures in advance of the courses and pose your questions then. I found the ability to get questions answered was more limited once you actually were working through problems and projects. There were simply a lot of students and fewer instructors than needed. In regards to the negatives, outside of the first week of courses, you will not receive a code review. There simply were not enough instructors to provide this meaningfully. I did not expect a review a week, but I think 2-3 thorough code reviews to identify poor patterns, structuring etc. would have been helpful. I have no sense of whether this is offered anywhere else, but I imagine it is. Bottom line: I do believe the school gives you enough to get you a job if you are commited. Due to various concerns and differing backgrounds, several peers took much longer to find jobs, but those who actively applied and hustled found jobs eventually (emphasis on hustle). There is plenty of demand. I'd recommend aspiring beyond just getting a job, and instead getting a great, high potential and supportive job, but there is also only so much that you can do if you are coming in from a non-traditional background. Are your peers going to contribute or detract from the experience? For context, after quitting a decent paying job in the USA, I left everything behind to give my entire life and focus for 6 months to become as strong a coder as possible in Berlin. I am not sure this is a realistic commitment for many and that is ok. The school has a broader mission than just people like me and that is part of its appeal. However, since the school's affiliation with the German Job Agency, many students are entering on free training programs to Spiced. This has dramatically increased the number of students and exposed the limitations of the school's structure and staffing. Everyone is super chill, we get along very well, and the group chat has stayed active months after graduation. I can't really give a clear assessment what the impact of the massive expansion of students is on student quality beyond anecdotes. I was extremely committed and motivated to get a job right away due to my personal financial commitment. I found surprisingly that almost no peers stayed and leveraged the space provided for the 6 weeks of job search after graduation. Paying my own money made the urgency of finding a role very high, and I was not sure that was the case for all students. However, those who persevered found opportunities and the market is still favorable enough although increasingly saturated. Concerning students, my main concern is that Spiced must stay vigilant to protect its brand and quality of incoming students lest the coding landscape become saturated like the United States (numerous bootcamps have gone bankrupt and job placement has plummeted). Bootcamps risk becoming a dismissed and commodity credential with Spiced simply being another certificate mill unless there is action taken now to continue maintaining the reputation and brand. 3) Is the school and space going to be conducive to excellence? The space was just a big open office, but I found it to be pretty calm and was able to take a quiet room for my coding when needed. The classrooms and monitors were great and I loved the lectures. The room was essentially overrun with students and there wasn't enough space if everyone had stuck around. They have moved spaces now so I am not sure this feedback is relevant. However, I would note that the space to keep searching and preparing for a job was completely inadequate and not taken advantage of for that reason. I had nowhere else I could go to for free with WiFi, but this certainly weighed on post-grad outcomes. Again, everything I am saying may now be irrelevant with the space change. The plus side is there was a coffee machine and kitchen. I had no complaints about living there and even sleeping there on one fateful night for 12 weeks, 7 days a week. Others might disagree. 4) Are you committed enough and interested enough in coding to commit above and beyond the school's offering? Many are not aware of the annoyance and detail oriented nature of coding before attending the school. This is simply laziness. Thousands of coding resources exist online and can be completed. Complete FreeCodeCamp, Udemy courses (focus on highly rated offerings from: Colt Steele, Max Schwarzmuller, Stephen Grider, Andrew Mead, Angela Yu), Code Academy... The pre-work the school provides is the bare minimum. If you are goign to commit months and years of your life to this, do your homework. This is not rocket science, but it requires persistence. I was shocked at for how many peopel the course was the first time opening an IDE. Frankly, without a real sense that coding is fun and something you are passionate about improving in, I would recommend delaying your enrollment in the school. This bootcamp, and for that matter any bootcamp, will not make you a developer. Without months of silent commitment to improving yourself and a tolerance for being puzzled and discouraged for hours, you will fail at becoming a developer or maybe you're clever but still you will you achieve far less than your potential. I don't think these abilities are genetic by any means, but I also don't think you get all the answers in 12 weeks, so prepare like a madman in Javascript, and the school should just help with the details and frameworks. The team are not miracle workers, and if you do not have work ethic they can't solve things for you. 5) (for Americans mainly) Is the program good value for the money? This is a special comment for Americans, but I think this school remains fantastic value for the money as it costs 50% of a comparable American bootcamp. Admissions standards are going to absolutely be lower than most comparable bootcamps in the United States and you can see that up front in what is covered in the curriculum. I would recommend you stack the curriculum at a few open-sourced bootcamps against Spiced and you will see there is about a 3-4 weeks of preliminary material that is done as pre-work for other bootcamps. Just raise your level, prepare aggressively, and you'll be fine. 6) Are you supported in the job search? I had fantastic relationships with the career support person (previous employee), but she wore many hats including admissions etc. The secret of getting a job is networking and strategically continuing your learning, and I freely offer my insight into what that entails to anyone who asks. I mostly achieved these tasks myself and there were some helpful sessions peppered throughout, but they assume you are starting as a relative neophyte. No career center can help you with all the prep/hustling this process entails but they can tell you where to apply your energies if you lack savvy. I expected a bit more structure in the prep offerings and interview support, but again, this takes personnel and money. There is a bit of a staff shortage, but I think that the new expanded support team will only improve in this area and based on my conversations, I see reason for optimism.",coursereport

First things first the teachers and the people who work at SPICED are amazing and that made the whole experience much better. Before I visited SPICED I was thinking if I am going to go to a coding Bootcamp or to a university for a bachelor's degree in software engineer. The decision going at SPICED was the best decision I have ever made. A couple of months ago I wouldn't believe that I could learn so many things and change my life in so short period of time.

I have been wanting to learn how to develop for a while and if it wasn't for SPICED probably I would still be stuck in the online tutorial loop. As a SPICED student, you will learn valuable, cutting-edge technologies and deliver code every day, in a very fast and intensive pace. Your portfolio will grow each day with interesting projects. The teaching staff is very supportive and passionate: they will do anything to keep you moving forward. Each one of the teachers manage to teach extremely complex topics in a fun, accessible way. The SPICED community works as a team. Your challenges will be your colleagues challenges. Regardless of what your level is as a developer, the course is built in such a way that it will demand the most of you. Expect to be constantly challenged and fully committed to the course. At the end, the knowledge and portfolio you will build in only three months is worth every moment spent at SPICED.",coursereport
2715,Spiced academy,2019-11-03,"I have had the plan to switch work sectors for a while now. And since trying to teach myself on top of a fulltime job was tremendously slow and not overly rewarding, I decided to take a more drastic step and focus on coding fulltime. So I applied for the boot camp at SPICED, which turned out to be one of the best steps I took. I joined the boot camp as an absolute JS beginner, while I had dipped my toes a little into other programming languages and concepts, I had never connected the dots in the way that I did over the course of the three months at SPICED. Plus my coding skills were super limited by the time I started the boot camp let alone develop full-stack applications. Those 12 weeks of classes and projects basically took me from writing simple blocks of code to writing full-stack applications. That being said, coding is a constant learning process and by the time you finish, there is definitely still a hell lot to learn. However, those weeks truly show you, what you are capable of learning in a short period of time, if you set your mind to it, dedicate your time and keep pushing - and by that I mean basically code, code, code. SPICED is intense and hard. I had days that felt wonderfully easy, where I felt completely on top of what we were covering followed by days where I simply felt like I was never going to fully get it. Thankfully you are in an environment, where you are not the only one going through these feelings but there is a whole bunch of you going through these things at the same time there are teachers there to guide you through it and they are incredibly helpful and supportive in catalysing your learning progress. I am still amazed and proud of what I learned to build in this short amount of time. During the first half of the course, you cover a lot of different aspects of web development and build up the fundamentals to start full-stack development projects during the second half of the course. Once you have graduated, you can still come to campus and work there so you will still be able to ask for help in the six weeks after you have completed the course. The boot camp provides a great environment for you to learn and grow, but you are the one that has to do the learning and growing, no one can do that for you. This might sound rather silly and obvious, but the bottom line is, you have to pull your own weight. You have to get comfortable with not knowing everything, sometimes not understanding everything straight away, and most frustrating of all: learn how to ask the questions that help you figure development problems out, when all of this is completely new to you. SPICED is quite fast paced and pushes your comfort zone of how much you are capable to learn, absorb and take in. For me maybe one of the most valuable takeaways is not necessarily how much can code by heart today, but having build up the skillset and confidence in myself that I will be able to figure things out and learn the things I don't know or understand yet. Basically, SPICED teaches you the skills needed to jumpstart a continuously ongoing learning process. Altogether I highly recommend SPICED as an amazing starting point for anyone that wants to learn how to code and pursue a professional career in this field, but be ready to push your comfort zone of learning.",coursereport
2716,Spiced academy,2019-04-10,"Had a super time at my bootcamp with SPICED. Speaking of my cohort in Oct2018, they had selected a diverse range of students. For a total of 18 weeks!!! (12week bootcamp + extended 6weeks) you are free to use and stay at the facilities as long as you wish and receive help by the teachers. This is important for the time after the course bc you should be able to master coding challenges to prove you are familiar with your craft while you're on the job hunt. The curriculum is always up-to-date and according to the needs of the industry. I only had wished to learn things about pair-programming or working on a project as a team. David and his team are very committed to support and provide a holistic and contagious coding environment/ learning experience. + you get to meet a community of kind (and smart) people. In the end it's up to a students entitlement of what one gets out of this bootcamp. I learned myself the hard way and can't stress enough to be really prepared for the course with their prep material (JavaScript in general) and during the course to ASK AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, since these are prerequisites you need anyway to work in software development. Enjoy your journey.",coursereport
2717,Spiced academy,2019-04-08,"Attending SPICED Academy was one of the best decisions I have made. Since I was moving from the US to Berlin for this course, I did a substantial amount of research in order to find the right school for me and I ultimately chose SPICED. I applied in March 2018 to start in the October 2018 cohort and during that time I completed the prep course work several times to get a good grasp on the concepts. I joined the bootcamp as a complete beginner and once I finished the course, I was amazed at the incredible progress I made, how much I learned, and the applications I was able to build. The teachers are incredibly helpful and always willing to help you work through a problem but also ensure you understand why that problem occurred in the first place. That being said, this course is also incredibly demanding - it is a bootcamp after all! I spent an average of 10-12 hours every day at school for 6 days of the week. This is a fast-paced learning environment where you are challenged on a daily basis and expected to learn by doing. One of the first things I learned at SPICED was getting comfortable with certain parts of your application not working and how to patiently troubleshoot and work with your peers to figure things out together. This is all part of the learning process! There were times when I was incredibly frustrated and other times when I was overjoyed because I made something work on my own. In all, I absolutely recommend SPICED for anyone interested in making a commitment to learning programming. It was a gratifying experience that provided me with the skills necessary to apply to the workplace as a junior developer. You just have to be willing to put in the work in order to truly see progress in your abilities and get the most out of this course.",coursereport
2718,Spiced academy,2019-03-25,"Graduating from SPICED Academy is truly a life-changing experience.

You will get everything you need to get an entry level job -- provided you are willing to work hard and be proactive. Even after graduation you can always ask for help. Every day I went there with excitement and joy about what I'm going to learn and build today. I was never bored and always challenged. I absolutely loved it and had no trouble finding a junior position. I recommend preparing beyond the prep course they provide you with though and mess with a code a bit beforehand -- it will make your life much easier.

I did extensive research before opting for this bootcamp and can honestly say that ,while there might be good alternatives, SPICED was the perfect choice. Things to highlight: 1. Up-to-date curriculum & tech stack 2. Staff that cares about your personal & technical development 3. Great help through the staff & alumnis even after graduation",coursereport

It would have been great if the bootcamp had 2-4 more weeks so more content could be thought and get the students extremely well prepared for the job marked (in 12 weeks you got to ""well prepared"" status). It would have also been really swell if it was possible to do frequent code reviews for each student multiple times (which demands a lot of manpower, something no bootcamp that I know of has).

2723,Spiced academy,2018-10-07,"I went to Spiced-Academy last April-June and I should say that it is right up there on my list of "" The best decisions I've made"". Prior to attending the bootcamp, I've been studying in a University as a Software Engineer but I felt that I wasn't learning enough. The school is theory heavy and you learn little on the practical side. I did my research and found about Spiced. After talking to Shilpa, I decided to enroll and boy I did it right. Before starting the bootcamp, they will give you a homework and for future students, pay attention to the homework and do your research before hand. Most students get problem during the first couple of weeks because they're in the state of shock. If you prepare enough, you won't experience this coding stuporous state. :) The mentors are really good. They are always there and if you get stuck at something, they can help you but try to do it first before you ask, that way you are sure you're not asking a stupid question. The course is very intensive and even after you get home, you will have to do some study or exercises so be ready to dedicate your time, you are in Berlin to learn and not as a tourist. Make friends because it will make your life so much easier. If your only purpose is to land a job as a developer after you graduate, this is not for you. There is no assurance that you will get a job when you graduate. If you like coding and you want to learn (and you are 100% sure of that) then this course is for you. Overall the experience is tantamount to nothing. The things I learned in 2 years in school is nothing compare to what I learned in 3 months in this bootcamp.",coursereport
2724,Spiced academy,2018-09-07,"I also attended the first Data Science cohort and I can fully support the positive comments made below by Konstantin. The course at SPICED Academy was very valuable and intensive likewise. We got more than just a brief hands-on introduction on each topic as often seen before in online courses. Kristian was awesome at teaching and he fostered our abilites to code steadily. He always took into consideration what the participants were interested in and set the focus within the main topics variable and very encouraging. The curriculum was very concise and Kristian was always capable of making a clear connection between the topics covered and the tech stack used. After graduation we now know a lot more about clean, well-structured and object-oriented coding in Python and respective frameworks, and about getting a project from development to employment. We have also got a profound understanding of the underlying theories of both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, when to use them and how to evaluate them in the right manner. All in all, it has been the course I was looking for. I got everything at hand I need to know to dive deeper in any Data Science related topic and I feel well prepared for future work.

I also liked career workshops that helped me to craft a nice american-style CV that I was not ashamed to send to companies. If you want to change career I would recommend a bootcamp, however be warned that a bootcamp is not for everyone - I really advice you to prepare with some free online courses, I think it's not stressed enough by SPICED.

2727,Spiced academy,2018-03-06,"I attended the Full Stack Bootcamp at SPICED Academy between Sept.17 and Nov.17. The experience was hard, I worked every single day for 3 months, between 10 and 12 hrs a day, I suffered under stress and banged my head against the laptop when I couldn't figure out how to solve the problems. However, I did not regret any single minute of it. It was an extremely gratifying time, where I changed from my old me to this new me that I am right now (professionally speaking :-) ). The curriculum at SPICED goes gradually from learining basic Javascript, HTML and CSS stuff during the first half of the course, to managing both the frontend and backend of relatively complex apps. I found the exercises and projects to be very well designed to learn more and more difficult concepts gradually. At the end, when you get into the final project, which you choose and design on your own, I felt like I had really learnt a lot. I found myself being able to architect and build the idea I had in mind. The atmosphere at SPICED was great, I went very gladly to school every day, looking forward to meet my classmates, the teachers, the school team and the students from other cohorts. I hold the teachers (Dave and Matt), as well as the other employees of the school (Shilpa, Paul and the CEO Frederik) in the highest regard for the job they do running the place. Besides their professionalism, they were always extremely freindly and helpful, always taking care of us making sure we had the best time possible at school. My classmates were also amazing people. We developed a great and tight relationship and learnt to work together, help each other and count on one another when needed. The body of students at SPICED is amazingly diverse, coming from all corners of the world, but somehow they all turn out to be really great and funny people. We worked and studied together, but we also played together, partied together, ate together, chilled together... As the weeks went by I found myself more and more comfortable at school and it began to feel almost like a big family. Thanks to the preparation I received at SPICED I am to say that I was able to find an entry-level position pretty quickly after the bootcamp. Within just two months, even with Christimas and New Years in between, I got offered a paid internship as Fullstack Developer. Currently (Mar.18) I am beginning my second month of internship, I am learning tons of stuff, frontend and backend, and there is much more to come. If everything goes well I will be hired as junior developer right after the internship. As far as I know, all the students from my cohort that graduated with me have landed a job as developers of various levels. I can say that my life has completely changed after doing the bootcamp at SPICED. Before I had a job where I was terribly unhappy and which I could not see myself performing any single day more. Now, after some months of hard but gratifying work, I have a job with great prospects, in a firm which offers me a chance to learn and grow, and with a team I cherish and admire.

2732,Spiced academy,2017-10-13,"I graduated from Spiced Academy's full stack developers course eight weeks ago, and today I have signed a contract as a Frontend developer at an established start-up in Berlin. I feel that Spiced Academy's course was very relevant and up to date and that the curriculum prepared me well for the technical questions that came up during the interviews. I would not have landed this job without Spiced Academy. The course is fast moving and you do need to be somewhat self-reliant. The lectures and course notes are clear and well organised and guide you in completing the exercises and projects but you a given a lot of freedom in your approach to the solutions. It was important to ask for help when stuck as the instructors do not always check in with you. I liked this style of teaching as I feel it is more realistic of the real world and increased my confidence of tackling technically challenging problems by myself, although it may not suit everyone. When I did need additional help, both instructors, David and Matt, were approachable, friendly and extremely supportive. I was impressed with their knowledge and like their different approaches to problem solving and teaching. I learnt a lot from both. The first half of the course focus on learning the basic and fundamentals of web development. There is a lot of information to learn and I didn't realise at the time how important so of it was. During the second half of the course, the projects become bigger and what we had learnt in the first half came together and I felt like a full stack developer. I found that the projects from the second half gave me a good portfolio to put on my GitHub to showcase my abilities but most to the technical questions in the job interviews were based on what we had learnt in the first half of the course. . I had completed a couple of free online coding courses before joining spiced and this definitely helped and I would recommend this. However, without Spiced I think I would have struggled to know what I should be focused on learning and I would have struggle to stay motivated. I definitely would not have learnt so much in such a short time. My favourite part of the course were the React projects, my least favourite part of the course was the Backbone project. However, having said that, the interviewers seemed to like that I had knowledge of an older library such as Backbone and could compare working in it with the more modern React. For that reason alone I am now glad it was included in the curriculum. I am in my late 30's and I was concern that my age may be an issue as tech is a young person's game. During the course, my age was not an issue at all and all ages mixed well together. Afterwards, during the job hunt, I do believe I possibly did not progress with some job application because of my age, however where I was offered an interview I was told that they saw my age as a positive and liked that I had previous experience in a different field. The career works shops was more relevant for people that have not had much experience in the job hunt process so a lot of it I already knew but I did take away some good tips that helped during the job search and it was also a useful refresher and motivational component. My cohort was also amazing people from many different countries and I am glad to have had this experience with. They made it easy to stay motivated through the 12 weeks and the job search. In summary I found the course to be fun, interesting, challenging, relevant and believe it offers good value for money. However, it is hard work and you will need to take responsibility for your own learning and success. I would not hesitate to do it over again.",coursereport
2733,Spiced academy,2017-09-01,"I have a background in HR and I had worked in couple of tech startups and in IT consultant resourcing. I however realised I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of software development and be able to code myself. I was already living in Berlin and I was researching the different bootcamp opportunities here. I soon noticed that SPICED and its Full Stack Web Development program would be the best option because of its interesting and encompassing curriculum and the positive reviews I read about it. I haven´t regret my decision a single moment. I could never have been able to believe how much you can learn in only 12 weeks. I still remember watching the previous cohorts´ final projects and thinking I could never be able to build anything like that. But as the 12 weeks passed I noticed I had grown from someone who was struggling with Codeacademy´s exercises to being able to create full stack web applications. Many thanks to the excellent teachers David and Matt! If you are determined, willing to work hard and want to learn to code in a supportive and encouraging environment, SPICED is the right place for you.",coursereport
2734,Spiced academy,2017-09-01,"I had studied product design and wanted to go from making physical products to software. I did a bit of studying on my own through codecademy and such but had a hard time keeping up my own pace and knowing what to do next. I started looking at developer boot camps and SPICED caught my attention, I was a bit causious as I didn't believe that three months was enough time to fully learn what was promised but decided to reach out and book a meeting with Shilpa. She was happy to meet me and answer any and all questions i had, i got to meet with the teachers and even sit in on one of the lectures. I made the decision to do the course and since the first day I haven't looked back. David and Matt, the two teachers are competent and willing to help at all times, the curriculum feels tailored for the job and is constantly updated to match the fast changing job market. The career workshops helps prepare you for getting a job when you graduate and most importantly, SPICED feels like a little family, you spend 8-10 hours a day in school so having a good atmosphere and work environment is very important. If you feel willing and ready to really dive inte coding then this course is for you. With that said i wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to take a lot of days off or keep a job on the side, the course really is full-time!",coursereport
2735,Spiced academy,2017-08-31,"I entered SPICED Academy a couple of months after graduating from a bachelor's of economics. I am passionate about development economics and technology and I want to work in social entrepreneurship. I had been trying to learn how to code for a long time, so I chose a bootcamp for an intense learning environment, and I decided on Berlin both because I adore the city and because its tech scene is thriving (and it's great for beginners, so many meetups!). I fell on SPICED by chance but it’s after my Skype call with Shilpa, the Director of Programs and Community, that I knew SPICED was the right fit for me. I wasn’t wrong. Frederik (SPICED CEO), David (Head Coach), Matt (Coach), Paul (Marketing Manager) and previously mentioned Shilpa, have managed to create an inclusive, supportive and superior learning environment, where any student with the right motivation can grow and excel. I have gotten so much more out of SPICED than I had even hoped to. I still cannot believe I managed to create 4 quality Full Sack Applications, using JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Angular.js, React.js and many more! I have to say, I went home exhausted every evening, and had a couple of coding dreams... It’s an intense 12 weeks! But I finished the day proud of what I had achieved, and excited about what I’d learn the next morning. I believe that the most important thing about SPICED is the quality of teaching, as it is the reason you would choose a bootcamp over an online course. David and Matt are incredible teachers and form a great team. They were always there for us if we needed them, whether it was for a quick question, or to save us after a couple of frustrating hours facing a bug we were initially determined to solve ourselves. Other than learning a programming language from scratch, I realised that my problem solving skills immensely improved too. Following David and Matt’s example, we slowly learn how to identify where the problem comes from and how best to solve it, and soon enough you know why your app is crashing, on your own! Another key skill you learn is simply how to learn on your own - which is something that you will have to continuously do as a developer. Another thing I loved about SPICED was its community. The cohorts are small and cohesive. Your classmates come from very different backgrounds and countries, but everyone sticks together and helps each-other during the bootcamp and even beyond the 12 weeks. I have made friends and good memories during my time at SPICED, and now away from Berlin I miss our well-deserved beers and a chats on Fridays. Overall, I recommend SPICED because of: Its quality instructors. Its curriculum that teaches the best practices to be a good programmer. The care and work they put into improving themselves and making each student’s experience the best it could be. Their career workshops that help you be more self-aware, confident and job-ready. And finally because you want to take your first steps as a Full Stack Developer in a kind and caring family.",coursereport
2736,Spiced academy,2017-08-22,"Before SPICED, I had been working in the Berlin tech/startup scene for about two years as a journalist. After a startup I was working for went under, I knew I wanted to expand my knowledge and find a new comfort in the industry. I stumbled across SPICED by chance, but I'm so glad that I did. I'm not going to lie to you. My time at SPICED was frustrating, exhausting and emotionally draining... but it was also equally fulfilling, rewarding and empowering. Learning a new skill can be rough, especially if you're starting from literally nothing. Fortunately, you're immersed in a supportive environment throughout the entire process. The cohorts are small, so it's easy to become close and ask for help from your classmates - plus David and Matt are always there if you get stuck. Having worked in Berlin tech before, I didn't think that I needed the career workshop part of the program - but I was totally wrong. Shilpa was such a valuable asset to my success post-SPICED, helping me craft my career story and pitch my skills to potential employers. While I decided to accept a role in technical writing, I had also received multiple interviews and offers for Frontend and JavaScript developer positions. All of this happened within weeks of my graduation. That's why, for the most part, SPICED receives top marks from me. But not everything is perfect, so there are some downsides: SPICED is still a growing community, so the network you gain is pretty small compared to other big boot camps like General Assembly. This is changing, and there are some alums trying to plan meetups for graduates and current students outside of official SPICED events. I also wish there had been more on pair programming, testing or other workflow aspects of development within the curriculum. But hey, there's only so much you can do in 12 weeks! Overall though, 12/10 would suffer through it again.",coursereport

I just finished the course and I'm now focused on finding a job in France. I was a beginner and was wondering what we could learn in just 12 weeks. I had now idea about front-end, back-end, databases and large concepts of web development so that was really a new start for me... And we learnt a lot ! That's crazy, I feel now prepared to find a job of developer, and this is because of the amazing work of Shilpa, David, Matt, Frederik and Paul. In a cosy atmosphere, Matt and David were very involved and passionate teachers, extremely supportive, giving me more confidence. They were always available to help, and I really enjoyed the content of the course. Big point for me : I see all the time on the jobs offer the languages and frameworks we learnt, and I have the feeling that part of the course is useful in the daily like of a developer. I had to work a lot during my experience at SPICED, to don't feel overwhelmed by all the new technologies, concepts that we had to use everyday. Obviously, 12 weeks of coding doesn't make you an experienced programer, so you will have to keep being curious, working on new projects, all the time, but it's an habit you can easily take during the course, because it's a part of Matt and David's pedagogy. As I was not used to look for a job, to write a CV and a cover letter, the career workshop was super useful for me and I learnt a lot from Shilpa and everybody's experience. I still using all the tools, tips, and references she gave us, for finding a job that fits with your expectations, and I'm already seeing the positive results. During those three months, I learnt something I wanted to learn since a long time, and I had way more than what I expected. I also met amazing people, teachers, other students, that I consider now as friends and I will keep tons of good remember of my experience there. That's why I give the max rate for the SPICED Academy !",coursereport

Spiced has some of the best curriculum and teachers focused on critical thinking/fundamental skills needed in both interviews and when on the job. They'll help you go from knowing very little about the digital world to securely programming your own ideas in less time than a typical college internship. After graduating, they'll help you to successfully navigate the exploding Berlin tech scene. Probably the best thing about Spiced is its Javascript focused curriculum (the most popular tech stack amongst startups, yet not bootcamps for some reason) along with a teacher who seems to have solved every issue in web development. He's passionate about passing on this knowledge and helping students learn from their mistakes. This is not just another for-profit coding school that seem to be popping up in every city. Spiced is committed to producing an academic structure that prepares students to tackle any challenge they see with curiosity and courage. It's an attitude that I'd always look for when hiring for software developers in the past. Lastly, Spiced is a great way to get introduced to a new city and make new friends. There are hosted meetups, hackathons, and happy hours to get to know one another and the larger community. If you're looking for a reasonably priced entry into a new career in a fun, vibrant, international city, the Spiced Academy is the place to be.",coursereport

I decided it was something I definitely wanted to learn, but I couldn't find the will to do it by myself online, nor the time to take a university degree. After reviewing several bootcamps both in the US and in the EU, I finally found the right one! Much better than anything in London, Barcelona, Madrid... Why? - First of all, they have a great professional team. Everyone, from the CTO to the teaching assistants will be there to help you and give you advice. - Second, they have a great curriculum: for the first time in my education life I was learning actual USEFUL stuff. Things companies require the moment you start applying for a job. And it's not a few weeks, it's actual months, so we go deep into everything we learn. - Third, they have a great space in Berlin, really beautiful offices full of light, space to work, a really nice kitchen... - Last, but not least, the price. It's an investment, and it's much cheaper than all the american bootcamps, and quite well priced among the europeans. If you work hard on it -and they'll make it easy- you can get a job after graduation in a matter of weeks! Looking back, I can say it was one of the best choices of my career. Completely worth it!",coursereport

It was an unexpectedly great combination of theory and practice with well structured curriculum. We covered a lot of topics, had cross-functional workshops, developed a capstone project and all that for indeed a lot of hours of hard work. The coaches Lea and Amr are very competent, supportive and were able to create a good environment to share, ask, learn and grow. To anyone who is expecting a very social academy environment, influenced by the Instagram stories, it was nothing like that but I can without doubt recommend this specific bootcamp for the great organisation, professionalism, atmosphere and coaching.",coursereport

The example exercises are interesting and provide the needed, extensive hands-on training. The topics covered provide the foundations for beginning your own projects. Furthermore, I could directly build on a lot of the things I learned in the bootcamp in my subsequent Data Scientist position. Beside the course material there were extra challenging tasks, allowing you to further extend your skills, if desired. As the course was fully online, I thought that sitting for 12-weeks in front of the computer would feel like a long time, but the contrary was the case. It was never boring and every morning I was looking forward to the classes.

2744,Spiced academy,2022-02-07,"I will start off by saying I am very happy with my experience at SPICED Academy's Data Science Bootcamp, because I learned as much as one can about the topic in the period of 12 weeks (any more and my head would have exploded) and I felt like I was among close friends with the other students, teachers and staff there. I was accepted to 3 data science bootcamps overall, but I decided for SPICED Academy for 3 reasons: - I got great feedback from alumni - The material is at my level and is up-to-date (I watched a sample lecture before joining) - They have a dedicated careers team to help build my CV and job-search strategy (I found most other bootcamps to have little-to-no support on the job-hunt) Each week I completed one project which centered around one or a few topics. Every project has a couple of building blocks (like modeling, visualization, then deployment) and if you only complete part of it that's perfectly okay. At the end of the week you discuss your progress with the class which is very chill but also a great moment to learn from others. For the final project, I had only about 10 days to complete so as you can imagine it was not the most impressive thing I could do (other bootcamps typically allocate 4 weeks to final project) but I choose to have more class time over a more impressive final project because I knew I had time after the bootcamp to complete impressive projects. Others did more impressive things than I did, so it's not impossible. The teachers mostly come from PhD background and have industry experience, so they know what they are talking about. Some of the teaching assistants are still getting the hang of it, and that would be my only minus point. Other bootcamps (like Data Science Retreat) give the impression of being more technical, but the SPICED Academy bootcamp was at the exact right level for me, someone with an Economics + Analytics background without experience working in a technical field who wants to get a job as a Junior Data Scientist.",coursereport

I had done online courses previously but Spiced Academy's full-stack program fast-tracked my learning. It gave me structure and focus, and my instructors were my most valuable resource. Though some topics were difficult, I never felt lost thanks to the help of my instructors and my cohort. They offered insights without spoon-feeding, and encouraged me to consider different approaches and solutions to problems presented. It is important to understand that one's progress in the bootcamp and afterwards is self-driven. Spiced Academy's curriculum provides key information for web development but my most important takeaway from the bootcamp (and my instructors) is an approach to learning that tries to balance effectively navigating a fast-evolving tech landscape while encouraging deeper understanding of a particular technology. Everyone in tech accepts that continuous learning is part of the job, and with Spiced Academy, I learned how to do this more effectively.",coursereport

I appreciate that there was even an assessment process to begin with, to understand if I was cut out for it and to see through the course finally. The course is demanding and not for the faint of heart to say the least -- there are subjects and projects that require full attention and devotion to be fully mastered and covered, even beyond the scope of the duration of the course itself, which, in my opinion, is a bit condensed, but still, to manage and learn a variety of coding languages just in 12 weeks and be able to build upon your own projects afterwards, seems worthy the effort. The instructors have been incredibly helpful and provided full support throughout the curriculum, which was well paced. Overall, I really gained a better insight and hands-on experience into frontend and backend development and was really satisfied with the process and the outcome in the end. In regards to job assistance, there are several supporting pillars the course offers, along with job interview trainings and cv reviews that certainly provide helpful tools so as to become a proper candidate for entry level developer job positions.",coursereport
2750,Spiced academy,2021-11-17,"I did the Full-Stack course during lockdown and it was one of my best life decisions since it helped me land a job as a full-stack web developer. Spiced Academy gives you the foundation and tools to start your career in web development. I found it impressive how Spiced changes their curriculum to suit the job market for example, they no longer teach Angular, but React and I saw that they've also included TypeScript as well as JavaScript. The teachers are really enthusiast and we rotated through them, so we had various teaching styles and approaches. The bootcamp is intense and there was one point where I really close to burnout/giving up. If this happens contact any of the teachers, most of have been through the bootcamp and understand what you're going through. It took time to get used to, but I liked how their was no hand-holding or spoon feeding and you needed to be proactive with asking questions or help. Since the the bootcamp is only 12 weeks, sometimes it feels like you barely understand one topic before you jump onto the next, but a lot of topics repeat or build up on themselves. The teachers are good at staying on topic, which I think is great at keeping you focused on what's important and because of this they can cover more and you end with a broad set of knowledge that you can keep building on after graduation. As well as the coding encounters, there were also useful resources on how to change your work identity and CV and I found the talks given by previous students really motivating. The graduation projects are also really inspiring.

One flaw that I can say is that the career sessions were taking place between courses and it was really annoying! In the pace of this intensive bootcamp it is completely impossible to focus on other things, especially between courses. Because you are always in a position to catch up with the course material and tasks you have to do and believe me you are always one or two steps behind! So the only thing in your mind was that day's task you need to complete or the course subject you are trying to digest. That's why it would have been better if these valuable career sessions would take place after the courses ended or at least in a relatively free time so that the students could have an option to focus on the material with a clear mind.

The Spiced teachers were super friendly and almost all of them were a good help, also under lockdown conditions. Though a good sense for self-teaching and initiating group-work is needed. The curriculum is quite well structured, even if there were ""reorganisations"" from time to time which were a bit confusing. A student's english level should be very good to be able to easily follow along the lessons. Also preparation (there are prep lessons provided) /a little experience before the course regarding python coding and basic statistics is necessary to not drop out in the beginning and have a hard time to catch up I suppose.

And this in only 3 month. Of course in this short time period, in-depth knowledge can't be achieved. But self-assigned graduation projects can be used to dive a bit deeper into a specific area of Data Science. Overall I'm very satisfied with this bootcamp and grateful for engagement of teachers and staff of SPICED Academy. I definitely learned a lot. Pros - each week a new topic and project, which were insightful and most of the time fun - very engaged teachers and staff - well structured course and more material for further learning - career service Cons - due to remote learning (at the point necessary due to COVID regulations) the fast-pace learning was pretty intense and challenging",coursereport
2758,Spiced academy,2021-02-23,"For a long time I was interested in learning Python and a bit curious (albeit sceptical) about data science. It wasn’t until I joined this course that good instruction, curiosity and use-case connectivity collided to really unlock an expressivity that had been trapped within me since adolescence. If this sounds a bit like therapy, then I’d say go with the flow: early on, I found myself genuinely “in my element” and I (actively) decided not to look back. I have a mediocre maths degree from long ago that I never knew what to do with. But this walk through Kristian’s SPICED shop (with Tom, Stefan, Gesa, Paul and an incredibly interesting cohort) immersed me among the half-forgotten but familiar set of ideas (Poisson distribution there; Eigenvector over here) that never became the sensory overload that I might’ve feared.

So I searched thoroughly to find a course that suited me and read many reviews. Not only did I want to learn data analysis and programming in Python, but I also wanted to do this in a short period of time combined with the latest machine learning techniques. The course at SPICED Academy was very demanding, but the quality was worth it, the teacher support for the participants was great and the course structure was logical, stringent and helped me to gain a deep understanding of Data Science in a short period of time. Overall, I can highly recommend the Data Science Course at SPICED. You have to be aware that it will be challenging, especially through many statistical topics, but you can get a lot out of this course as long as you are willing to put in the effort and time. *** Course structure *** In each of the 12 weeks, a different topic was dealt with very intensively and a weekly project was developed. There were short sessions on special topics in the mornings and afternoons. The projects were very practical and realistic. At the end of each week, each participant gave a short talk on what they had done or learned or found out during the week. The exchange with the teachers and my fellow students was given at any time, so that questions were answered immediately and no one was left alone on their learning journey. This proved to be particularly important due to the Covid-19 pandemic, as we had to take the course online. However, the teachers ensured that an open, relaxed but focused learning atmosphere was created and maintained. *** Learning atmosphere *** All SPICED teachers were eager and passionate about their subjects, which was very motivating. This was especially evident during the final project phase in the last week, when students had to develop a final project of interest on their own. The teachers were just as interested to ensuring that the projects reached their full potential as the students who worked on the projects themselves. Additionally, SPICED provides comprehensive advice on preparing your resume, LinkedIn, GitHub and any other relevant professional portfolio sites.

The number of teachers is not enough for the number of students which can be very frustrating while working on projects. If you manage to survive until the end, you will be able to create and do nice things with a bit of confidence but the foundation will not be stable and strong.

Every week we covered a new topic, which can be summarized like this: In the first 4 weeks we covered the basics of coding/data science (python/pandas/numpy/scikit-learn/Machine Learning theory), then in the next 4 weeks we focused on deep learning (Tensorflow/Keras) and all kinds of different neural networks, and finally in the last 4 weeks we looked at topics like distributed computing, databases, deploying of python projects and of course worked on our final project. Kristian, the head teacher, is just amazing. He knows everything about Python and Data Science, and - maybe even more importantly - you can see that he really enjoys teaching. This makes for a very special combination! He is great at explaining difficult topics in a simple manner, so you can pick them up quickly. Also, he is always trying to make the curriculum as interesting for the students as possible. So for example, each week he asked us what areas of that week’s topic are of special interest to us, so he could adjust the topics/material according to our interests. I think he is what makes this data science program really special. In addition, the whole environment (employees/fellow students/equipment/facilities etc) at SPICED is very pleasant and makes for a great learning atmosphere. All in all, I’m very happy I decided to take this course. I had a great time at SPICED and learned a great deal! I would definately do it again.",coursereport

I was first drawn to SPICED because it's located in Berlin, but I ultimately decided to join its Full Stack Web Development program because of its people. The entire team at SPICED is determined to help you reach your goals, whatever those might be. Personally, I knew before joining SPICED that I did not want to become a developer. I wanted to complement my business experiences in tech with real life coding knowledge. Additionally, I knew that I wanted to join a company in a hybrid role that combined client relations and product management. I was able to land this job after one month of graduating from SPICED.",coursereport
2767,Spiced academy,2018-03-09,"I highly recommend SPICED academy! For me personally SPICED was a life changing experience, I never expected to be a web developer, especially after only 12 weeks and now I found a job as a Software Engineer. It could be stressful at times and students could get lost and even decide to drop out, but this is a part of the experience when at the end you see the outcome of your coding skills you forget all about that and it will be totally worth it. so my advice would be that you keep going no matter how hard it gets! The teaching part was great and clear as the teachers are always around and would happily help regarding any questions. Not to forget mentioning the atmosphere, we were like a family there spending 8 to 10 hours together every day. I still miss being there! an advice that I would like to give new applicants is that you should focus on the pre-course and try to study the basics of Javascript before starting the course so you don't get overwhelmed, because the course moves very fast and the topics switch fast so when you know the basics then it will be easier to keep up with all the technologies switching.",coursereport
2768,Spiced academy,2018-03-09,"Tbh, it's not easy to become a web developer, and to be even more honest, it's certainly not easy to learn it all within a few months.....three to be exact. SPICED does a great job of giving you all of the necessary resources and access to learn, but as with everything, it was up to my colleagues and myself to make it a priorities. With that out of the way, it was an incredible, harrowing, difficult, worthwhile, trying, and enlightening experience. There were a thousand times, honestly, that I thought about dropping out because my background and life beforehand had absolutely no bearing in computer science, web development, or programming at all. But, staying in and pushing through was by and far one of the best decisions I ever made. My cohort was a diverse group of people, not only in backgrounds but also in interests and motivations, and they ultimately were the support group that I needed to make it through this 3 month course. Of course, there are a thousand things that I would change in the last few months, like studying more, applying myself to the coursework, and probably having a social life outside of it....LOL.... but I would not change any of my decisions to attend SPICED or change my career path to that of a developer -- I mean, shit, I went from a bartender to now a full stack developer working on hella intense projects now. So --- if you want to change your career path and want something more, and you have the drive / determination to stick with something difficult despite it being tough sometimes, apply and get to it. But, if you're not one for putting in the hard hours and diving deep into the coursework, don't. Just want to make that clear, because again, being a web developer is tough and doing it in 3 months is even more so. You've been warned...but if you like the challenge, then welcome to it!!",coursereport
2769,Spiced academy,2017-12-22,"I graduated from SPICED Academy in Berlin and got a job in the US within 1 month of graduation. I have been working as a software developer for a company that makes math and science simulations for schools. Before deciding to learn web development I was a high school science teacher. A couple of years ago I knew I wanted to leave the classroom and saw web development as my next venture. I started studying on my own and I made some progress, but it was slow. I knew that I needed a mentor and someone who could scaffold the learning for me so that it was easier to progress There’s a lot of information out there – some of it digestible and some of it not. With a bootcamp you get a curriculum, a solid path and person to whom you can ask questions. I knew that I was going to quit teaching at the end of the school year so it seemed like a great opportunity to go live abroad for some time. Both my husband and I have always want to live in Europe. I thought the best way to keep studying and get the European experience was to attend a bootcamp in Europe. So we looked for an English boot camp that had the right curriculum and the right timing. SPICED was it. My experience at SPICED was amazing! The teachers are fantastic and the curriculum is very cleverly structured to get you the most gains in the least amount of time. Other than HTML and CSS the whole program is focused on Javascript which allows you to develop strong Javascript skills. The head teacher, David, is extremely knowledgeable. The way he introduced the topics made the concepts easily digestible. He modeled how he would write code so that we could see his process. He talked about beginner pitfalls and helped us understand why our programs should be structured in a certain way, but at the same time left room for us to solve challenges on our own. Most assignments could be tailored to different skill levels; there was always a required set of problems, but often there were extra challenges for those of us that wanted/needed them. Besides teaching the ins-and-outs of the Javascript language, SPICED instructors taught us the fundamentals of software development. After leaving I found it easy to pick up other languages and frameworks. Many of the projects that appeared to be for one purpose could actually be used for something else. I attended a Hackathon a few weeks after leaving SPICED and worked on a project hat hoped to hook up black, female entrepreneurs with others. The founder essentially needed a social media site and because I had just built one at SPICED, I knew just what to do. Each new project I encounter I apply something I learned at SPICED whether that be something specific like how to write an AJAX call or, more broadly, how a piece of software is architected. Even though the curriculum focuses on certain platforms (my cohort learned React and Redux, for example) SPICED will give you a fantastic foundation to get started in software development.",coursereport
2770,Spiced academy,2017-12-01,"tl;dr SPICED is great, definitely go there, if you are really up for it! I was part of SPICED's full stack cohort from July to October 2017 and I am very happy I decided to go with SPICED. Already one month after graduation, on November 1st, I started my new job as a Full Stack developer at a digital agency in Vienna, Austria. So, I am writing this review with a bit of time having passed since graduating from SPICED and already having gone through the first couple of weeks as a professional developer. Having had very little experience with coding prior to coming to SPICED (except for tinkering around with a few courses on codecademy), the curriculum was challenging from day 1. But after all, I was signing up for something called a 'boot camp', so I already had a feeling that it wasn't going to be a walk in the park. The two teacher David and Matt were a great help throughout the entire journey and are one of the great assets of SPICED. They do not spoon feed you answers, but rather try to steer you in the right direction when you are stuck. Personally, I absolutely loved this approach of them being there whenever you need help, but otherwise letting you figure out your stuff at your own pace and in your own way. That being said, I would not recommend SPICED to you, if you are not fully committed because no one will spoon feed you answers and ultimately it is your responsibility to make sure you keep up. I have made the experience, that I learn the most, by actually writing code. Some of my fellow gingers (ginger was the name of our cohort ;)), took the approach of first wanting to read up on documentation and trying to understand the topic they were dealing with. This approach didn't really work for me. I tried to struggle my way through an exercise line by line. If I had no idea where to start, I tried to come up with the first line of code as a start and worry about the rest then. As you progress as a programmer, you start thinking out solutions prior to writing your actual code, but especially in the beginning, this approach proved very valuable to me. My favorite project I worked on at SPICED was the petition project, which started around week 6 or so. Prior to that, we had been working on small exercises that taught the basics. The petition project was the one project where it finally all came together, we built our first full stack web app and we got to apply pretty much everything we learned in the weeks prior to that. I still remember the moment, when I successfully deployed my petition to Heroku - that was when I realized how much I was learning and how fast I was progressing. Even though SPICED is great and all, the first couple of days on the job were quite intimidating, but that quickly gets better. Of course, I am still the most junior developer on the team, but I never really feel like I am completely lost or less appreciated because of that. One thing I did not yet mention but which makes my time at SPICED very memorable are the people there. The SPICED family is quite small and cohort sizes are not too large (I believe we were 8 people in our cohort at graduation), so you really get to know the people around you and the atmosphere in the office is always very warm and welcoming.",coursereport
2771,Spiced academy,2017-11-22,"The course at SPICED was beyond expectations. Although a lot of work had to put into learning complex and advanced coding in 3-months, the instructors David and Matt are great and teach and teaching you the logic behind things. Not only did SPICED teach you how to code but you also form friendships with the people in your cohort as well as other cohorts. You all become part of a big family that is helping each other out. The best part of the week is 17h00 on Fridays when you open your first beer and just enjoy the end of a hard working week. Moreover, there is Paul who is open to showing and suggesting places to go to around the city and of course, Shilpa who is taking care of every concern that comes your way. Overall, very satisfied and great experience that helped me land a job in 2 weeks. Would recommend to anyone!",coursereport
2772,Spiced academy,2017-11-18,"All the instructors are really good, and will constantly try to gain the most out of you. The result is that you'll learn the most in-demand skills out there (React, NodeJS), as well as build up a great Github portfolio to be shown to the employers. But I warn you: there's no magic in it, meaning that, first of all, you really need to master the prep course they assign you before starting the academy, and, second, you need to stay fully focused on your programming tasks during the entire period. Big sacrifices, big achievements",coursereport
2773,Spiced academy,2017-10-04,"I'd worked in digital marketing for over 10 years at companies large and small, often surrounded by developers, before learning to code myself. I looked at a lot of different bootcamps as well as exploring self-learning options but was drawn to Spiced because of their javascript-focussed curriculum. I'm so glad I signed up with them. The course was brutally hard at times but ultimately the experience was rewarding beyond anything I'd imagined. Learning to code in a bootcamp environment is tough and you need to draw deep on your resilience at times, but Spiced offers excellent teaching standards in an incredibly supportive environment. Fellow students and the Spiced staff give you all the support you need to take a leap into the great unknown (!) and if you show up and put the work in you'll come away armed with a wealth of new skills. It's true that as a newer arrival on the scene than some other bootcamps, their network is smaller, but this is changing as more of their cohorts graduate and maintain links with the college. Because cohorts are reasonably small and they have a couple running at once, you have an opportunity to really build bonds with your fellow students which I feel is a real benefit vs choosing to learn with a more established provider eg General Assembly. The career workshops, while of benefit primarily to those earlier in their career, still offer some themes of interest for 'older' students and are a great added extra to the course. Finally, they offer great help if you're relocating to Berlin for the course and are full of advice for finding places to live and getting established. Thanks Spiced - I look back on my time there very fondly!",coursereport
2774,Spiced academy,2017-09-19,"Why SPICED? At first I was skeptical about taking a coding bootcamp but then I talked to Shilpha in an interview to hear each other out including potential concerns I had. After talking to her I was sold on SPICED despite being accepted into others as she was honest about expectations on me and what the school could deliver. They sure did deliver. If you want to go to a school where you are spoon fed all the answers and have lectures all day instead of writing code yourself then apply elsewhere. If you want to go to a bootcamp where you learn-by-doing then apply for SPICED. From the learning facilities and environment to the top-notch staff who really know their stuff and always want to help and see you improve. I went from knowing very little HTML and CSS to being able to program in JavaScript and creating web applications that communicate with databases to being able to publish them live with the latest tools used. Be prepared it won't be a ""holiday"" in Berlin but a learning experience you'll have for life helped kicked off by the awesome people at SPICED.",coursereport
2775,Spiced academy,2017-09-13,"Be careful with this school: it can turn sour. The CEO convinced me to join their programme unprepared. Subsequently they did not help me catch up. One of the teachers advised me to consider ‘joining the next cohort’, instead of helping me figure out exactly what I was having difficulties with. After attending the first few days of this bootcamp, I felt defeated and have now decided to spend my energy elsewhere. Spiced uses an external tool, Codecademy, as a prep course for their full stack program. When I worked through the Codecademy track, Codecademy had updated and shortened some of the tracks, which led me to being un-prepared for the Spiced assessment, which they want you to complete. I had therefore done a stripped down version of the track, which was missing some critical concepts that I needed to know, and so instead of completing the assessment in 4-5 hours, I ended up horribly stuck for a few days and feeling incredibly incapable. This mishap, in combination with the frustration during the first weeks’ classes has led me to the decision that the quality of the bootcamp is lower than expected and promised. Dear Spiced, if you use outside resources like Codecademy, it is important to make sure to know about any changes to the material being taught. I feel it would be wrong to expect the student to know that they're missing something. Codecademy clearly posted about these changes to this specific track on their blog over a month ago. Furthermore, from the words ‘from beginner to ready-to-hire’ on their website and the reviews available online, it seemed like we would get a lot more explanations of the concepts and hands-on support early on. I felt I needed this, but I did not get it. The work is independent and I did not feel a good enough connection with the teachers; I also felt that they were not going to be able to provide me with the pedagogical teaching methods it seemed Spiced offered. I might as well be sitting at home, working through freeCodeCamp. Their communications staff member and I discussed that some people do need more thorough explanations, or maybe some simpler challenges to fully grasp certain concepts. I did not have the right foundation from the prep course and we were already moving onto newer subjects which were building on this. Sitting there feeling completely overwhelmed during the second and third day was emotionally exhausting and I was doubting my capabilities, and felt incompetent. Due to the aforementioned circumstances I hoped they would consider refunding me the full seven thousand and eight hundred euros, but no. I’m now left feeling ripped off. Their ‘registration’ fee is a massive €800 euros, which you do not get back if you are forced to ‘drop out’. Before the course started I trusted the CEO as he reassured me that others before me had not completed the assessment and had gone on to do okay. I was told the teachers would sit with me and once the bootcamp started and during the first few days, to make sure I felt okay. Unfortunately this has not been the case for me and I feel as if these were false promises made. Spiced runs two cohorts at the same time, so with only two teachers for two cohorts, this means the teachers are not dedicated only to supporting your cohort. After not feeling listened to and asking for the full money back, and writing that I would be writing a negative review, the team at Spiced responded to me by saying that they felt I was blackmailing them. Thanks Spiced. These are the reasons I am disappointed and feeling ripped off. Be careful too, the CEO is unreasonable and after explaining my frustrations over a Skype call as he was not on campus, he did not seem interested to want to take in my feedback at all. Thank you for reading, you’ve been warned.",coursereport

After doing the math, I found out that after the flight, rent, and coast of living, I would be saving money by doing this program in Berlin. The staff is wonderful, and the environment is very friendly. My fellow peers became friends that will be friends for life. My advice is if you are considering it, just go for it.

2779,Spiced academy,2017-01-19,"I always wanted to learn how to code, made several attempts with online coding schools but never got very far. Therefore after long considerations, I finally decided to enrol in a coding bootcamp. I can only say I have not regretted my decision for even one moment. I joined SPICED in the second cohort and was impressed by how quickly I was able to program pretty complex things. Their curriculum focuses plainly on JavaScript, which makes a lot of sense in my opinion. That leaves enough room to really learn the language and not just a few frameworks. We were taught JavaScript the hard way, by first doing challenges in vanilla JavaScript before later learning how much easier it can be done with a library or framework. That way I feel comfortable to program almost anything I want in JavaScript or pick up any new framework by myself, which I have already done quite a few times.",coursereport
2780,Spiced academy,2017-01-18,"I still remember the first time I met Shilpa, the Director of Programms and Community at SPICED, for the first time after she gave me an appointment to check out SPICED HQ. She was so friendly, so was Frederik, SPICED CEO and Founder, and David, CTO and Head Coach. From day 1, David, the most godly-skilled head coach I've ever met, started the course with full enthusiasm. He's just so good in delivering the information and let'em sink in! As of every single day of the course, he kept teaching us in a way that feel that he is giving his 100%. Besides his JavaScript-every-couple-days-fifteen-minutes-theoritical portion, he always have practical challenges for us; what is called white board challenges. Prepare yourself also for the most common interview questions for developers he will train you for. Day in day out, we programmed and built awesome apps using the lastes frameworks, libraries and technologies. All what I can say about that is you have to be prepared for an instensive 9 hours of programming every day that you wish you had before (if you are really willing to learn). In my experience, I would spend three months in an intensive bootcamp rather spending, at least, tripple the amount of time watching free online courses, even paid ones! I did that before I went to SPICED and I wouldn't say that it was a waste of time, but It was so easy to forget! At the bootcamp, they wouldn't let me leave the class before I understand what they were trying to teach me. That was for me a BIG PLUS becuase it showed me how much they care. Ok wait a minute.. did I say ""they""? Who are they? Well, I already mentioned David but there are also 2 teachers/assistants. First is Julia, SPICED Teaching Assistant & Developer. One of the most experienced array-fan developer that you will ever meet! You'll know her more once you meet her. Oh, and make sure to be on time or she would like to have a lil chat with you over a cup of coffee. Ask me about that. Well, let's face it > you are being serious and you want to learn? you be on time. Period. That proved me, again, how much they care about their students. Second is Matt, SPICED Teaching Assistant & Developer. Matt is more of a friend than a teacher to me. His skills are just beyond mind and I am proud to say that he taught me once! He, David and Julia make just a great team. I have been taught by masters! Shilpa did an awesome job in workshops she led at SPICED. She taught us lots of useful tips of how to create our CV as developers (should be unique), make our cover letters (because you have to) and along with Matt, how to organize our LinkedIn profile. Basically, everything you need to be job ready. I would really recommend paying them a visit and check the school out. You'll know what I am talking about once you are there!

The content taught is relevant to my actual professional tasks and it´s structured in a way that allows to support student at very different levels of knowledge and familiarity with the topics of data analysis, science and engineering, as there are enough references and challenges to pick up and develop from even after the course.

2784,Spiced academy,2022-10-17,"I did the fully remote Data Science bootcamp. The small class size of approx. 15 students as well as the full-time teaching staff made it a very focused and productive experience. Teachers were able to dedicate a lot of time to answering questions in one-on-one breakout rooms and I appreciated the remote learning structure. We would do a lesson all together and then work independently on our weekly project in smaller batches in breakout rooms that changed daily, allowing us to connect with our classmates and ask each other questions. We would complete the week with short presentations from each person about one aspect of their project. Week on week, we developed a portfolio of 10 projects plus our final project, which we worked on individually. The curriculum is Python-focused, spending only about a week on SQL, which is prominent in the job search. It covered many topics including machine learning (classification, regression, natural language processing, time series), data processing (NumPy, Pandas), data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Metabase dashboard), deep learning (recommender systems, image recognition), data pipelines (AWS S3, web scraping, APIs, MongoDB) and more. In a 12-week program, these topics are covered quickly so the course's documentation portal was a great online resource for reviewing topics, even after graduating. Career resources were good, covering basics like types of jobs, salary negotiation, CV writing etc. You have to take the initiative to set up one-on-one meetings with an assigned career advisor, which is a useful resource with specific input on your profile. Ultimately, relying on career services is not enough to result in a job. Applying a lot, networking, speaking with in-industry mentors via free external resources also needs to be part of the effort. Overall, an excellent foundation, but like every bootcamp it requires independent study afterwards (especially in SQL) to gain proficiency. Career services offer a good boost to get started, but you have to keep going and networking on your own.",coursereport
2785,Spiced academy,2022-06-15,"I had a mostly disappointing experience at SPICED academy (spring 2022). What was disappointing: 1. The quality of teaching and the level of experience of the teachers. Many classes were taught by bootcamp graduates who had themselves graduated the bootcamp and then started immediately teaching (—> no knowledge of industry or even the mathematical or statistical background of different methods). In these cases, you’d be better off watching youtube videos than going to classes since teachers could not answer questions and often gave incorrect answers (errors only caught by students who had a more rigorous background in the topic). Definitely not worth the price (which is higher than other bootcamps). Teachers as well as the staff were unresponsive to complaints. 2. Background of other students: the bootcamp is not selective in their intake of students and in reality has no requirements for students to prepare for the bootcamp. This makes the overall level of graduates lower than should be and a lot of the time in classes is spent on explaining very basic things that were in theory pre-required knowledge. What was good: 1. The material is well put together and you have access to it after the bootcamp as well 2. Topics covered relevant for the job market. 3.

Some topics where covered in the curriculum much better than others, but it is really impossible to cover all well in this short time period. Data Analytics was introduced (still to become a professional Data Analyst one should consider better attending a specialised for Data Analytics bootcamp or to study this in autodidact mode), as well as Machine Learning. Also challenging and fascinating topics of Web Development with Python were introduced with Flask and Heroku. I think I got a good base at the Spiced bootcamp in these areas to advance further after the bootcamp. On the other hand the Data Engineering part of Data Science was not delivered well in my view and those who want to become Data Engineers working with cloud technologies should better take another path to this profession. Also Statistic part of Data Science was almost ignored in favour of programming part. Maybe the choice of making accents was wise, maybe not. Future will show.

2790,Spiced academy,2018-07-05,"I think the course is a really great intro into the world of programming and Javascript. I like the way the curriculmn is laid out, with every new lesson feeling a little more complex than the last. I like the exposure to two different frameworks: Vue and React, but I felt the job market asks more for React and Angular. At times, the course can really challenge you which is a really good lesson to determine if this is something you want to do long term. Those uncomfortable challenging moments will persist once you enter the job market...so really assess if this is something you want. Some things the course doesn't offer that I've found to be important (reflections after entering the job market) is exposure to the git process when programming as a team or in groups. I think this is really crucial to first days on the job, and will just take more time to learn. The course doesn't touch upon or discuss testing, which can really set yourself apart when looking for a job (often times the coding challenges ask for these). Also keep in mind that after graduating this 12 week course, you will still be very very beginning and have a LOT more to learn on the job.",coursereport
2791,Spiced academy,2018-03-09,"My experience at SPICED started out well - but as the course proceeded, I quickly recognized that the program didn't have the value I was hoping for. I wish the program was much more transparent upfront - otherwise I wouldn't have invested so much money into it This review isn't meant to be bitter - but more of a constructive critique. Generally, the staff were super nice. I thought David (the head instructor) was affable – However, after overhearing him mutter an insult under his breath about me (after asking a javascript question), it was alienating - it hurt - and it made me less comfortable talking with him – which is unfortunate, since I thought he was a nice guy. The typical day consisted of a short presentation (30-45min) in the morning - followed by a task to complete. The proceeding 6 hours you were left on your own to actually learn the material - usually from youtube instructional videos & stack overlow. It reminded me of that quote from Good Will Hunting ""“You wasted $150,000 on an education you coulda got for $1.50 in late fees at the public library.” I get it – a lot of the learning process is self teaching. But it’s also about inspiration from instructors – and further, being around motivated, smart peers. More than half of my cohort left a few weeks in– instruction became bleak- sitting in a giant, empty room - watching instructional Youtube videos, alone. With an instructor I felt I couldn’t ask questions to – 100% demotivating. I also get it. The program can’t be as selective as programs such as App Academy, Flatiron, Hack Reactor,etc. It’s new and it needs as many students as possible – so they’re not in the position of turning anyone away. This invariably leads to a bad mix of students. Are there better programs out there, definitely. I’m hoping SPICED has grown up and revamped their course – it was a shame – the basic pieces were there. But the Instructors and Adminstrators should not be proud of what happened.",coursereport
2792,Spiced academy,2017-12-27,"I have no idea where all these positive reviews are coming from. This was not the experience my colleagues and I had during this course. Most people, even those who weren't feeling as challenged as some of us were, felt that as much as the teacher was very knowledgeable, he was the opposite of supportive and helpful. If he didn't like you or was in a bad mood, nothing to do but try to figure out how to complete this course with the help of other students (unless you want to feel worse about yourself). Which is definitely not what 8,000€ should get you... Beyond that, it was clear that the curriculum was not meant to be taught in 3 months. Most other places take 5-6 months, but it seems that the school wanted to tap into the 3-month visa crowd. The speed and difficulty (basically no gradual learning of very complex concepts) made most of us who had limited backgrounds feel constant frustration and confusion, and we left the course very insecure about our abilities. Basically, if you have a CS degree, you'll do fine and be a bit challenged in this course. Anyone else, I suggest going to a more professional, longer course, where the well-being and success of the students is prized higher than the tuition price. The rest of the staff and the actual location and facilities were great though.",coursereport

2802,Digital career institute,2024-11-20,"Nuova Speranza - meine Reise zum Regenbogen. Nuova Speranza, so mein Desktop Hintergrund und DCI Mantra, in Anlehnung an einen meiner fantastischen Lehrer mit biografischer Verbindung nach Sardinien (sentimental bewundernde Grüße an Giaco und Rami, an Gaël, Anton, Nicole, Louisa, Ash, Metin, Albert, ...). Denn genau DAS beschreibt umfassend auf das Maximum reduziert in zwei Worten meine durchgehend/ausnahmslos positive Erfahrung mit diesem auf so vielfältige Weise großartigen Bildungsträger. Nuova Speranza. ""Neue Hoffnung"" also. Im Sinne von neuen, tragfähigen beruflichen Perspektiven, die vor meiner DCI experience schlicht nicht vorstellbar gewesen sind - und das war nur der Einstieg. Mit Bewilligen der Fortbildung durch die Agentur gab es nach gefühlten Nanosekunden auch schon ein detailliertes Kursangebot per Mail gefolgt von einem Anruf meines DCI-Bildungsberaters Bogdan Cosma., der Kursdetails nicht nur leicht verständlich erklärte, sondern in beeindruckend liebenswürdiger Geduld aber auch jede Frage sofort kompetent beantwortete, gar anbot, man könne ihn jederzeit mit jedem Kursanliegen anrufen selbst an Wochenenden. Ein schönes Beispiel für ""normative Kraft des Faktischen"", solches Engagement setzt Standards, schafft Erwartungen, ist Referenz, die andere erstmal erreichen müssen. So war Bogdan ganz nebenbei Markenbotschafter für DCI, sein Verhalten ließ einiges erhoffen für den inhaltlich durchaus sportlich-ambitionierten Kurs. Diese positive Ahnung wurde dann ein ganzes Jahr lang weit übertroffen in einer mir davor nicht vorstellbaren Weise. Konkret bezogen auf DCI Staff: tatsächlich wären mir in durchaus abwechslungsreicher beruflicher Vita nie zuvor engagiertere Mitarbeiter:innen begegnet, die einen in jeder Form, jeder Funktion, in jedem denkbaren Kursaspekt, bei allen Schwierigkeiten bestmöglich unterstützt haben weit über die eigene Stellenbeschreibung hinaus. Genuin glaubwürdig authentisch mit Herzblut Lichtjahre über ""Dienst nach Vorschrift"" hinaus. Tatsächlich alle, denen ich das Privileg hatte, zu begegnen. Sie wollen Deinen Erfolg. Wenn Du also das tolle Privileg einer bewilligten Fortbildung im Digitalbereich hast, wirst Du einen qualifizierteren, philanthropischeren, engagierteren Bildungsträger kaum finden können. Idee und Konzept meines Kurses fand ich ohnehin super, sie entsprechen meinen Idealen von einer knallbunten Welt der Gleichen, die in liebevollem Respekt einander wertschätzend unterstützen. Was auch sonst. So hat man schlicht mehr Spaß. Von der Idee zur Tat: Die konkrete Umsetzung schöner Ideale in gelebten Kursalltag fand dann auch konsequent statt, es war angenehmer Spiritus Rector des täglichen Miteinanders und machte den Stress sehr vielen Lernens neuer, bisweilen komplizierter Inhalte deutlich einfacher. Wenn auch nicht unbedingt einfach: Der Kurs insgesamt ist durchaus anstrengend und fordernd, konnte mich an Grenzen bringen, was Leben ja erst spannend macht. Grenzen finden, überwinden, sich entwickeln. Seriöse Ambition und Motivation sind unbedingt erforderlich für erfolgreiches Bestehen. Eine tolle, manchmal schwierige, aber immer inspirierende Erfahrung mit wunderbar verschiedenen, klugen, anregenden Menschen, die ich nicht missen möchte. Ob DU dafür geeignet bist im Sinne von ""ist es meine Tasse Tee"", lässt sich prima herausfinden im ""Orientierungskurs"" genannten Eingangsmodul von ca. 4 Wochen Dauer, in den einem verschiedene Aspekte des Web Developments näher gebracht werden. Das macht allen Beteiligten, also auch Dir, die Entscheidung leichter. Hast Du Dich für den Kurs entschieden und qualifiziert, erwarten Dich außer dem Tsunami neuen Fachwissens über modernes Web Development, das täglich mit praktischen Übungen vertieft wird, weitere klug konzipierte, praxisorientierte Module, die Dir den Einstieg in Dein späteres berufliches Setting erleichtern. Neben erwartbaren ""how to"" - Aspekten also (wie CD/Ci, git Workflow, Microservices vs. monolithic approach, Datenbankanbindungen ans selbst entworfene Frontend, Aufbau, Architektur, Gestaltung einer performant skalierbaren web application mit on demand rendered functionality etc.) noch die Vermittlung und das Üben sehr hilfreicher Softskills, die über Deinen späteren Erfolg entscheiden können. Alles im Team natürlich, wie es später auch wahrscheinlich im Job zu erwarten ist. Das Ganze spielerisch mit viel Lachen, dabei didaktisch klug wie inspirierend aufbereitet. Schließlich war noch Erwerb oder Vertiefen von Sprachkompetenz Teil des Pflichtprogrammes, in unserem Fall Deutsch oder Englisch. Schul- und Unibesuch sind bei mir nun schon einige Sommer her, aber ich kann mich nicht erinnern, je so komprimiert gelernt zu haben auf so vielfältige Weise, wie in diesem Kurs. Was gab es alles zu lernen, wen alles kennenzulernen. Eine tolle Erfahrung. Abschließend wünsche ich noch möglichst vielen Privilegierten nach mir diese sehr außergewöhnliche und schöne Gelegenheit zur Entwicklung eigenen Potentials, ihnen selbst und der Gesellschaft zum Gewinn. Fertig. Können wir jetzt endlich Coden? :) ================================================================ Nuova Speranza – My Journey to the Rainbow Nuova Speranza – this phrase adorns my desktop background and serves as my personal mantra, inspired by one of my fantastic teachers with biographical ties to Sardinia (sending heartfelt, admiring regards to Giaco and Rami, to Gaël, Anton, Nicole, Louisa, Ash, Metin, Albert, ...). These two simple words perfectly encapsulate, in the most concise manner possible, my consistently positive experience with this exceptional educational institution, which is outstanding in so many ways. Nuova Speranza. In other words, ""New Hope"" – representing new, sustainable career opportunities that were simply unimaginable to me prior to my DCI experience. And that was just the beginning. Upon approval of the training program by the agency, it felt like mere seconds before I received a detailed course offer via email, swiftly followed by a call from my DCI educational advisor, Bogdan Cosma. Not only did he explain the course details in a clear and comprehensible manner, but he also exhibited remarkable patience and kindness, promptly and competently answering every question. He even offered his availability for any course-related inquiries, including weekends. A wonderful example of the ""normative power of the factual"": such dedication sets a standard, creates expectations, and establishes a benchmark that others must first strive to match. In doing so, Bogdan became a brand ambassador for DCI, his conduct inspiring confidence in what was already shaping up to be an ambitious and challenging course. This initial positive impression was not only fulfilled but consistently exceeded over the course of a year in ways I had never imagined. Specifically, in terms of DCI staff: in my varied professional career, I have never encountered more dedicated individuals. Regardless of their role, every staff member I had the privilege of engaging with provided optimal support in every conceivable aspect of the course and every difficulty that arose – far beyond the scope of their job descriptions. They were genuinely, authentically committed, demonstrating a passion that extended light-years beyond mere ""duty by the book."" They genuinely want your success. If you have the privilege of approved training in the digital field, you will struggle to find a more qualified, philanthropic, or dedicated educational institution than DCI. The idea and concept of my course already resonated deeply with me, aligning perfectly with my ideals of a vibrant, inclusive world of equals who support each other with loving respect. What else could one wish for? It simply makes life more enjoyable. From theory to practice: The consistent implementation of these beautiful ideals into the daily course routine was a constant theme. This uplifting spiritus rector of our interactions made the stress of intensive learning – including occasionally complex new material – far more manageable. That being said, it was not always easy: The course as a whole is quite demanding and challenging. It pushed me to my limits, which is precisely what makes life interesting. Finding boundaries, overcoming them, and evolving. Serious ambition and motivation are absolutely essential to succeed. It was an extraordinary, sometimes difficult, but always inspiring experience with wonderfully diverse, intelligent, and engaging people I am grateful to have met. Whether you are suited for this program – in the sense of “Is this my cup of tea?” – can be easily determined in the “Orientation Course,” an introductory module of approximately four weeks. This provides an overview of various aspects of web development, helping everyone involved – including you – make an informed decision. If you decide to pursue and qualify for the course, you can expect not only a ""tsunami"" of new technical knowledge about modern web development, reinforced daily through practical exercises, but also additional well-designed, practice-oriented modules that will ease your transition into a professional setting. In addition to the expected “how-to” aspects (such as CD/CI, Git workflow, microservices vs. monolithic architecture, connecting databases to self-designed frontends, building and structuring a scalable, high-performing web application with on-demand rendered functionality, etc.), you will also gain valuable soft skills. These are practiced extensively and can be critical to your success. Everything is, of course, team-based, as it is likely to be in your future workplace. All of this is presented in a playful, laughter-filled environment, with didactically clever and inspiring methods. Finally, language skills were also part of the mandatory curriculum, in our case German or English. It has been several years since my school and university days, but I cannot recall ever learning so much, so intensively, and in such a multifaceted way as I did in this course. There was so much to learn, so many wonderful people to meet – a truly enriching experience. In conclusion, I sincerely hope that many more fortunate individuals after me will have this unique and beautiful opportunity to develop their potential, for their own benefit and that of society. Done. Now, can we finally start coding? :)",coursereport

2805,Digital career institute,2022-06-22,"Hallo, ich war im Orientierungskurs Webdevelopment und Marketing und dieser Kurs war echt herausragend und spitze. Respektvoller und freundlicher Umgang, die Lehrer/in freundlich, hilfsbereit und sehr sehr wissend im Thema. Ich mache jetzt im Juli den Python Backend Deveoper Kurs weiter und habe durch DCI dann sehr gute Jobchancen. Wer wirklich was aus seinem Leben machen will, sollte ein Weiterbildungskurs bei DCI machen. Den DCI ist anders, als die meisten mir bekannten Träger und Maßnahmen in Berlin, und die ich auch in den letzten 10 Jahren in Berlin selbst erlebt und absolviert habe als Träger und Maßnahmen. Die meisten anderen Träger in Berlin sind nicht respektvoll, nicht freundlich, meist unfähig oder unwissend oder machen unterirdische und schlechte Beschäftigungsmaßnahmen ohne ein je in einen Job zu vermitteln. Leben aber gut von Steuergeldern, und die Bundesregierung in Berlin macht das mit, und unterstützt schlechte Träger auch noch. Nicht so bei DCI, das ist der erste Träger und Weiterbildungsanbieter, der echt respektvoll und freundlich ist sei es von den Schüler/in oder Lehrer/in und wo auch die Lehrer/in umfängliches, echtes Wissen aus der Wirtschaft und Informatik haben. Ich habe das erstemal seit langem eine reale Aussicht auf ein Job und selbstbestimmtes Leben nach Menschenrechten die oft von Seiten der Leistungsabteilungen in Jobcenter in ganz Deutschland ohne Grund einem verwehrt werden. Diese Weiterbildungskurse können unter anderem auch für Arbeitssuchende mit einem Bildungsgutschein vom Jobcenter finanziert werden. Meist oder oft versuchen sich Jobcenter in ganz Deutschland darum zu drücken, und euch eine Weiterbildung zu verweigern, dann solltet ihr Klagen gegen das Jobcenter vor Gericht, kostenlos. Ihr gewinnt zu 99,9%, denn Weiterbildung ist ein Recht. Dann muss man mit einem 10 Euro Schein zum nächsten Amtsgericht der Stadt und kriegt dort ein Justizbeihilfe Schein für den besten Clananwalt der Stadt, und nach spätestens 3 Tagen ist man in jeder Weiterbildung eingeklagt. Gilt für jedes Problem mit den Jobcentern. Geht halt manchmal nicht anders. Auf jeden Fall kriegt ihr bei DCI eine sachlich fundierte Ausbildung in Informatik und Wirtschaft und es wird euch bei der Jobsuche und Eingliederung sehr gut geholfen von DCI. So könnt ihr mit einer sehr fundierten Ausbildung innerhalb Deutschlands oder außerhalb in den Ländern der EU oder Amerika oder Australien oder Asien sicher einen guten Job und gutes Leben finden. In Deutschland sind 80 Mio Einwohner, davon arbeiten noch 15 Mio legal und sozialversicherungspflichtig, 65 Mio Leute arbeiten ohne sozialversichert zu sein in prekären Lowlevel Jobs, sind in Rente oder arbeiten erst gar nicht aus welchen unterschiedlichen Gründen auch immer. (Quelle: Bundesamt für Statistik, 2019) Also echte fundierte Fachkräfte in Deutschland werden händeringend überall gesucht in Deutschland, in allen Arbeitsbranchen, und gerade besonders in der IT. Aber achtet auf eure Work - Life - Balance, laßt euch nicht verheizen und verkauft euch nicht unter Wert, am Arbeitsplatz in der Firma. Also Leute geht zu DCI und bekommt wieder ein Sinn im Leben. :-) Ich bin echt rundum zufrieden mit DCI und werde es auch im Bekanntenkreis weiterempfehlen.",coursereport

Es gab massive soziale Spannungen im Kurs, welche bei Neue Fische lieber unter den Tisch gekehrt werden, obwohl sich mehrere Kursteilnehmer dazu geäußert haben. Die Geschwindigkeit des Kurses ist viel zu hoch um sinnvoll die Inhalte aufzunehmen. Jahrzehnte der Lernforschung scheinen an der Eingangstür von Neue Fische abzuprallen.

2809,neuefische,2023-08-25,"Nachdem ich das Web Development Bootcamp 2019 erfolgreich abgeschlossen habe, muss ich leider sagen, dass die Webseite und die HR-Managerin nicht wirklich die versprochenen Jobs oder das Gehalt geliefert haben, mit dem Neue Fische wirbt. Anfangs hat das Bootcamp einen guten Eindruck hinterlassen, aber nach und nach wurde klar, dass es unrealistisch ist, innerhalb von 3 Monaten zum Webentwickler ausgebildet zu werden. Leider sind auch die Coaches negativ aufgefallen. Einige von ihnen schienen nicht ausreichend qualifiziert zu sein oder waren oft abwesend. Obwohl die Coaches nett wirkten, konnten sie die Lehrinhalte nicht immer optimal vermitteln. Manchmal führten sie auch unprofessionelle Gespräche über andere Teilnehmer und deren Leistungen. Ursprünglich wurde uns versichert, dass wir uns um Jobs keine Sorgen machen müssen und während des Bootcamps viele Angebote erhalten würden. Doch bei der Abschlussfeier waren nur 2 Unternehmen anwesend. Trotz meiner guten Leistungen hatte auch ich Schwierigkeiten, eine passende Stelle zu finden. Als ich die HR-Abteilung und die Gründerin nach potenziellen Partnerunternehmen fragte, um mich direkt zu bewerben, wurde mir mitgeteilt, dass aktuell keine Neueinstellungen geplant sind. Die versprochene Unterstützung bei der Jobsuche wurde nie geliefert. Viele meiner Mitabsolventen und ich stellten fest, dass der Bootcamp-Abschluss von den meisten Unternehmen nicht anerkannt wird und wenig Interesse am Markt besteht. Die Gehaltsvorstellungen der Schule unterschieden sich stark von der Realität. Ein Partnerunternehmen sagte mir, dass Einstiegsgehälter von 40-50.000 € unrealistisch sind. Viele meiner Mitabsolventen, die Jobs fanden, wurden während der Probezeit entlassen und arbeiten nun in anderen Branchen. Meiner Meinung nach ist Neue Fische eine Täuschung. Das Unternehmen zeigt sich nach außen hin gut organisiert, aber in Wirklichkeit sieht es anders aus. Mein Erfolg nach einem Jahr verdanke ich nicht Neue Fische, sondern den Online-Kursen auf Codecademy und Udemy, die ich nach dem Abschluss gemacht habe. Das Abschlussprojekt wurde nicht ordentlich überprüft, und viele hatten fehlerhaften Code. Daher habe ich mich damit nicht beworben. Erst nachdem ich meine eigene App und Website erstellt hatte, wurde meine Bewerbung ernst genommen. Die 8000€ für das Bootcamp hätten mir erspart werden können.",coursereport

Unfortunately, my experience was utterly disheartening, and I felt compelled to share my concerns. Before even enrolling in the program, I reached out to Mr. Álvarez with genuine enthusiasm and curiosity about the Data Science & AI program. However, his response left me feeling belittled, unheard, and disrespected. His tone was abrasive, and he seemed more interested in pushing me toward a bootcamp than in understanding my aspirations or addressing my questions. As a prospective student, I had high hopes and a deep desire to learn from Ironhack's esteemed program. But Mr. Álvarez's unprofessional demeanor and lack of empathy crushed my excitement and made me question the institution's values. Given this distressing experience, I have decided not to pursue the program further. I hope that Ironhack will take my feedback to heart and work on improving their customer service, admissions process, and overall student experience.

Definitely not worth the money though. The quality of the course work was disappointing, requiring the teachers to spend additional time fixing the issues in order to be able to teach. One of the teachers regularly missed classes in order to teach somewhere else and no substitute was provided. The teaching assistant was knowledgeable but had no experience in didactics, so even though they were helpful in assisting with issues, didn’t have much teaching abilities. Not enough support was provided for all students. Seemed like the teachers were lacking support from the school.

I can see how the course may be challenging and frustrating for someone with no previous design experience. Spending time completing the pre-work and really understanding the tools in advance would help with this. I would recommend this course for someone looking to boost their existing knowledge in design. If you're new to digital/visual design, you'll need to be ready to really push through and work very hard (including extra hours). Also be aware that interpersonal skills are a big part of this course – you'll be working almost exclusively in teams (in groups of 2, or up to 5 people), so being patient and understanding, humble and openminded is a huge part of this.

The SHOCKING news of the CANCELLATION of the bootcamp just five days before its scheduled start, due to only having two participants, marked the beginning of a series of OVERWHELMING problems. During the registration process, I found myself dealing with MORE THAN SIX INDIVIDUALS, and to make matters worse, I had to REPEAT the application process two or three times. The INEFFICIENCY of their communication system between the branches in Spain and Germany is UNACCEPTABLE and has added an extra layer of FRUSTRATION. In my struggle to obtain the GOVERNMENT VOUCHER, I faced more obstacles. The agent expressed DOUBTS about the RELIABILITY of Le Wagon, which only HEIGHTENED MY CONCERNS. The POSITIVE REVIEWS on their website do not reveal the DARK REALITY of the issues Le Wagon is facing. The LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM is evident, with people DISAPPEARING overnight, supposedly in ""VACATION MODE."" Additionally, they CHANGED the sales representative repeatedly during my process, causing CONFUSION and DISTRUST. To add INSULT TO INJURY, the Data Analyst course, which costs a STAGGERING 8500 EUROS, left me QUESTIONING ITS VALUE. After READING and CONTACTING former students, it became apparent that completing the course doesn't necessarily leave you as prepared as you might believe. Moreover, the ACTUAL EMPLOYMENT RATE is not accurately reflected on the website, as the INTERVIEWER candidly revealed that many students either LEAVE the course or pursue it for PERSONAL ENRICHMENT rather than seeking employment in the field. I made the PAINFUL DECISION not to continue with Le Wagon, losing TIME, MONEY, and even having to CUT SHORT my family vacation to attend this course. In summary, from START TO FINISH, my experience with Le Wagon has been a DISASTER. I cannot RECOMMEND this company to anyone and STRONGLY ADVISE reconsidering any plans to join them. A true NIGHTMARE that I deeply regret having lived through!",trustpilot
2819,le wagon,2023-07-15,"I did the Part-time Data Science online bootcamp from Le Wagon in 2023. Let me start with the application process: Everything worked well, they contacted me, I had a quick interview about my prior career and motivation. After that I had to do a little assessment. Nothing complicated. I got accepted and had to pay the fee of about 8.5K Euros. The pre-bootcamp was pretty unnecessary to my eyes as all of that stuff was collected from different free web pages, it was very much but most of the stuff was not needed during the bootcamp as it was covered again or not covered at all. The good thing was you could just check it as done because most of that stuff was not new to me. Let's start with the actual bootcamp: The first day was all about getting to know the other participants and preparing the Laptop/PC for the BC. Most of the stuff went through, they had a good and detailed instruction on github, however, some crucial points were missing (e.g. there were some errors occuring while setting up all the environments in the terminal) so one needed to call a TA, which on the first day took like forever... The first weeks were about Python, SQL, webscraping, and data science libraries. Nothing to scary, mostly very easy. So far nothing that was worth 8.5K. What I was really looking forward to was machine learning and deep learning. The machine learning weeks had good, but sometimes too easy tasks. Most of them ""stolen"" from a popular data-science book by Aurelien Geron which you can buy for about 70 Euros. The lectures were VERY mixed in terms of content quality. Some lecturers were ok, others really TERRIBLE. Sometimes I even skipped the lecture and read the chapter in the book by Geron. The deep-learning weeks covered different architectures of neural nets, however only the most basic ones. Nothing up to date was covered, especially not Transformers, which is a pitty as this architecture is mostly used nowadays. So the deep-learning weeks were ok, but pretty basics. Here one sees, that the creators are not keeping up with trends... Also the creators decide to use TensorFlow library, which, I guess, has didactical reasons. However, nowadays mainly PyTorch is used... Also some of the teachers of the live session were not able to answer questions that went beyond the pre-recorded lecture; I had to research on my own... The last part was about ML-Engineering. Most of the stuff was horrible because of the many difficulties in the tasks and how to solve certain problems so many students had. Also in the 24/7 some questions were not answered at all. Even when I used a ticket with a TA, he could not resolve the problem, also not a second TA... The final project was ok, however two team members almost did nothing or didn't answer any questions. Finally and this is most important to my review: The career-week. It was a waste of time. The lectures didn't help at all and the connecting event with companies was a joke. One company was not present at all, the other company not hiring for Data Science, a small start up with 3 members without a businnes-plan, and another company which sounded extremly dubious. I wished they would worked together with companies throughout the whole bootcamp maybe already presenting problems from them, which you try to solve so that they can find potentially interesting people. The way Le Wagon is doing didn't work for me. I regret doing the bootcamp. You should better go for a university degree if you want to get a job in that related field (Data Science, Data Analytics, ML Engineer...)",trustpilot

2821,le wagon,2022-10-10,"I recently completed the Le Wagon Data Science bootcamp program in Cologne, and I have to say it was an incredible experience. The program was well-structured and taught by experts in the field who provided us with a comprehensive education in data science. What I loved most about the Data Science bootcamp was the emphasis on hands-on learning. Throughout the program, we worked on real-world data sets and projects, allowing us to apply our skills and knowledge to solve meaningful problems. The instructors were incredibly knowledgeable and always available to provide guidance and support. The curriculum covered everything from data cleaning and analysis to machine learning and data visualization, and the instructors did a great job of breaking down complex topics into easily digestible concepts. The bootcamp was also incredibly well-organized, with weekly events and networking opportunities that allowed us to connect with other students and industry professionals. This was a great way to build a network in the field and get insights into the industry. Overall, I would highly recommend the Le Wagon Data Science bootcamp program in Cologne to anyone looking to break into the field or further their education in data science. The program was well-designed, and the instructors were knowledgeable, supportive, and passionate about the subject matter.

2824,le wagon,2023-02-05,"Having been a little hesitant to choose the remote web development course, I must say that from day 1 these preconceptions were washed away. The pre-bootcamp course material really helped to get your mindset ready. There were definitely big learning curves throughout the process but I think all bootcamps have this intense experience. The staff were really friendly and inclusive, really making everyone in my large batch (50 of us!) feel comfortable whilst also pushing us to get as much as we could out of the learning environment. By choosing Ruby and Rails, the course is very focussed around full-stack so bear that in mind - all concepts are fundamentals to get a job as a frontend or backend engineer. Would definitely recommend the process.",trustpilot

2835,Stackfuel,2024-10-15,"1. Hauptanteil der Weiterbildung besteht leider Gottes aus (interaktiven) Texten, also ähnlich wie „lernen mit Büchern“. Dabei wird jeder Schritt einzeln abgefragt („Tue dies, jetzt tue das“) Selbständigkeit wird dadurch nicht gefördert. Texte beinhalten neben unzähligen Grammatik- und Rechtschreibfehlern (könnte man in meinen Augen noch drüber hinwegsehen) leider auch inhaltliche Fehler, was leider auch in mind. einem Quiz vorkam. In meinen Augen ist das bei einer professionellen Weiterbildung, die in meinem Fall einen fünfstelligen Betrag kostete, ein absolutes No Go! 2. Die sogenannten „Lösungsvideos“, die auch existierten, aber erst freigeschaltet wurden, wenn sich erfolgreich durch die Texte gequält wurde, lasen lediglich die Lösung – also den Code, der benutzt wurde – vor. Eine Erklärung warum jener Weg gegangen wurde, fehlte leider gänzlich. Für jede Person mit tüchtig funktionierenden Augen war das unterirdisch und sinnfrei. (Kurzes fiktives Beispiel: a^2+b^2=c^2 würde im Video folgendermaßen „erklärt“ werden: „Und das Quadrat von a addieren wir zu dem Quadrat von b und erhalten c-Quadrat.“ Nein, doch, oh!) Zudem war der Ton häufig soo leise, dass ich meine Kopfhörer nicht immer nutzen konnte. 3. Das Arbeitspensum (zumindest im Data Scientist-Kurs) war trotz eines erheblichen Vorwissens out of space. Das schnelle und stupide Abarbeiten der Aufgaben wurde dadurch weiter begünstigt und die Selbständigkeit, Dinge wirklich eigenständig zu durchdringen, leider weiter gehemmt. Wie frustrierend der Kurs für Teilnehmer ohne Vorkenntnisse im Bereich von Machine und Deep Learning gewesen sein muss, kann man hier nur erahnen. 4. Die eigene Broschüren der verschiedenen Kurse legt die „Selbständigkeit“ der Teilnehmer in den Fokus, verkauft das Unternehmen als „strategischen Lernpartner“ und die Lernumgebung als „aktuelle Technologie auf neuestem Stand“. Unterstützung der Selbständigkeit – nicht gegeben, im Gegenteil sie wurde, wie oben an verschiedenen Stellen beschrieben, häufig genug gehemmt. Strategischer Lernpartner, welcher bei gestellten Fragen mit drei immer wiederkehrenden Antworten reagiert: „Hast du schon gegoogelt“, „Hast du schon ChatGPT gefragt“ und „Das weiß ich nicht, ich werde einen Kollegen fragen und komme wieder auf dich zu“ (Person kam nicht wieder auf mich zu. Auch nicht, als ich die gleiche Frage eine Woche später erneut stellte und mir erneut die gleiche Antwort gegeben wurde xd) – Daher ist in meinen Augen die Aussage, StackFuel sei ein strategischer Lernpartner safe auch nicht gegeben. Aktuelle Technologie – Vorweg: Es werden nicht die aktuellsten Versionen der Machine Learning Bibliotheken, wie zum Beispiel sklearn, benutzt. Ich hätte Verständnis, wenn statt der aktuellsten Version, zumindest eine Version benutzt wird, in der wichtige Erneuerungen berücksichtigt sind. Die benutzte Version von scikitlearn war 0.23.2 (zum Vergleich Version 1.3.1 war zur damaligen Zeit die aktuelle Version; Es gab also fünf neuere Versionen, als jene, die uns zur Verfügung gestellt wurde). Durch die ältere Version konnten viele Funktionen nicht benutzt werden und work-arounds waren künstlich notwendig, um die entsprechende Lösung zu erhalten. Besonders dann, wenn man mit „aktueller Tech. & neustem Stand wirbt“, empfand ich diese Tatsache als dreist. Mindestens genauso dreist fand ich aber auch die Bereitstellung von lediglich 4 GB Arbeitsspeicher. Data Science lebt von Rechen- und Speicherleistung. Wie man in einem Kurs, indem es um rechenintensive Verfahren geht, nur 4 GB anbieten kann, deckt sich mit meinem Eindruck, dass es bei dem Unternehmen hauptsächlich um Gewinnmaximierung geht, koste es, was es wolle. 5. Die wesentliche Mehrheit der Mentoren war leider selbst Quereinsteiger und konnte einem hin und wieder echt nur leidtun. Je nach Hintergrundwissen unterschieden sich die Mentoren extrem in ihren Antworten, in der Führung und im Aufbau des Kurses und in ihrem Engagement. Leider wurde mein Wunsch, wenigstens einmal in der Woche (gern auch in der Gruppe) aktiv (live coding) gezeigt zu bekommen, wie best practise im jeweiligen Kapitel auszusehen hat, ohne Nennung von Gründen abgelehnt. 6. Jeden Freitag hat die Nachmittagsbetreuung im DS-Kurs ohne Nennung von Gründen nicht stattgefunden – und das bei so einem Preis, nein Spaß, wir wollten nicht mehr über den Preis sprechen… xd Zusammenfassend: Ganz schlimme Erfahrung im Bereich des E-Learnings. Großer Verdacht, dass auf Grund von AZAV-Zertifizierung eine Art Goldgrube gefunden wurde - denn wo kein Kläger, da kein Richter...",trustpilot
2836,Stackfuel,2024-11-22,"Ich weiß gar nicht wie ich anfangen soll. Ich bin leider sehr vom Aufbau enttäuscht. Es wird zwar alles an Beispielen verdeutlicht, aber die gesamten Zusammenhänge fehlen. Es wird alles in Schriftform erläutert. Die wenigen Videos sind absolut oberflächlich und eigentlich nichtssagend. Ich kann zwar gern das Forum kontaktieren, aber das hat genau so einen geringen Lernfaktor wie der Kurs selbst. Ich kann einmal an einem Workshop teilnehmen, der an einem Tag in der Woche ist und nur zu einer Uhrzeit. Ihr könnt euch vorstellen, dass man nachmittags leider kaum Zeit dafür hat. Ich habe bis jetzt kaum die Zusammenhänge verstanden. Es ist gefühlt wild zusammen geschmissen und trocken erklärt. Geht eine weitere Aufgabe von der vorherigen in eine andere Richtung, kann man das ""Erlernte"" nicht mehr anwenden. Man zahlt einen haufen Geld für den Kurs, dass man letztlich wieder bei Google landet. Ich kann meinem Arbeitgeber sagen, dass er viel Geld ausgegeben hat und ich der Weiterbildung leider nichts anfangen kann. Schade drum, ich hätte gerne diverse Daten ausgewertet und damit Abläufe verbessert. Aber mit dem Wissen was ich jetzt erhalten habe, traue ich mich nicht an größere Datensätze. Sehr schade ist es zudem, dass man im Endeffekt nichts in der Hand hat. Keine Zusammenfassung mit deutlichen Erklärungen etc. Speichert man sich nicht irgendetwas ab, ist es nach dem Kurs verloren. Fazit: Nicht zu empfehlen! Ohne eine richtige Schulung (wenigstens per Video) ist der Kurs leider sinnlos.",trustpilot

2859,Stackfuel,2023-09-27,"Ich habe mich für den Data Analyst Kurs angemeldet (zwar auf Englisch, wohlgemerkt), da die Kosten von meinem Arbeitgeber übernommen wurden. Die Mitarbeiter von Stackfuel, mit denen ich in Kontakt gekommen bin, waren sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit - aber das war's auch schon. Folgende Punkte haben mich dazu gebracht diese Bewertung zu schreiben: 1. Es gibt kaum Videoinhalte, und die Lerninhalte bestehen größtenteils aus trockenem Text. Man kann zwar Code-Snippets eintragen und diese werden ausgefürt, aber es findet keine Validierung auf Richtigkeit statt. Und wenn man weiterliest (egal ob man was eingegeben hat oder nicht), wird man so oder so gratuliert (""Congratulations! You've learned xyz""). Das alles wirkt m.m.n. einfach minderwertig und nicht würdig für so einen teuren Kurs. 2. Wenn man nicht an den wöchentlichen Online-Meetings teilnehmen kann, besteht die Option Fragen im Forum zu stellen - und diese werden auch schnell beantwortet. Allerdings sind die Foren so gut wie leer! Es gibt so gut wie keine Fragen von anderen Teilnehmern von denen man profitieren könnte. 3. Man verliert den Zugriff auf die Inhalte nach Ende des Kurses. Dies war mir zwar von Anfang an klar sodass (anders als bei Punkt 1 und 2) hier keine Enttäuschung entstanden ist. Jedoch sind die Gründe dafür nicht ganz nachvollziehbar für mich, denn man hat dafür ja schließlich bezahlt. Wenn es an den begrenzten Kapazitäten der Cloud-Umgebung liegt, kann man das zB mit einem PDF-Handout und einem lokalen IDE lösen. Klar, man könnte in der Theorie eigenständig Screenshots machen aber das ist nicht der Sinn der Sache. Ich schreibe so gut wie nie Bewertungen im Internet, aber der Kurs hat mich leider so dermaßen enttäuscht dass ich ich mich schließlich dazu entschieden habe, meine Frust öffentlich zu machen. Bin wenigstens froh dass ich keine ~5000€ aus eigener Tasche gezahlt habe. Es gibt genug Ressourcen im Internet die wesentlich, wesentlich günstiger und hochwertiger sind.",trustpilot

2867,Stackfuel,2023-02-18,"Während ich den Data Analyst (DA) Kurs noch weiterempfehlen würde, so würde ich von dem Data Science (DS) Kurs abraten. Pro: -Das Lehrmaterial ist zwar ebenso gut aufgebaut und strukturiert wie beim Data Analyst Kurs allerdings ist der Umfang an „Tools“ die man über den Kurs erhält deutlich umfangreicher. Con: -Zum Ende des Kurses zeigt sich ein Problem auf welches man vielleicht auch nur als Anfänger stößt und das ist der Umfang an Möglichkeiten zum Experimentieren während der Projektphase. Im Laufe des Kurses arbeitet man lediglich Übungen ab, entwickelt aber keine eigenen Konzepte oder erhält Anregungen wie man dabei am besten vorgeht. Als Projekt wird dann erwartet, dass das experimentiert bis es funktioniert, was an sich legitim ist, wenn es dabei ebenfalls Feedback geben würde. Während man mit eigenen Modellen experimentiert, so kann es immer mal wieder vorkommen, dass man einer Merkwürdigen Error-Massage über den Weg läuft oder unvermittelt in einen Time out der Umgebung läuft. An sich wäre das auch kein Problem, wenn es individuelle Projektbesprechungen geben würde oder wirkliche Hilfe durch den Support während der Projektphase. Wendet man sich an den Support so erhält man nur den Hinweis, dass Hilfestellungen nicht mehr erlaubt sind [-1]. Was umso absurder ist, da man auch im Verlauf des Kurses immer wieder darauf hingewiesen wird bei Problemen den Support oder das Internet zu nutzen. Ebenfalls unglücklich ist, dass man keine „Auflösung“ des Projektes erhalten würde, wenn man das Projekt nicht zufriedenstellend abliefert. Den Teilnehmenden wird also die Möglichkeit vorenthalten die eigenen Denk-/Konzeptionsfehler nachvollziehen zu können [-1]. Dieser Ansatz ist nicht nur pädagogisch höchst fraglich, sondern auch höchst unseriös. Als persönlich Fazit würde ich daher weden den Intensiv-Kurs (DA & DS) noch den DS-Kurs einem Anfänger empfehlen, der diesen Kurs nebenberuflich absolvieren will. Auf Grund fehlender Betreuungsangebote es leider Schade um das Geld. Wer den Intensiv-Kurs über einen Bildungsgutschein absolviert mag hier besser aufgehoben sein. Allerdings würde ich auch hier Anfänger raten erst den DA-Kurs als Einzelveranstaltung zu absolvieren und sich zunächst an eigenen kleinen DS-Projekten zu versuchen und nicht direkt den Intensiv- oder DS-Kurs zu belegen. Datensätze dazu gibt es zB bei ""Kaggle"" und Lehr/Orientierungsmaterial unter ""machinelearningmastery"". Stellt man dann fest, dass man strukturierteres Lehrmaterial braucht, so mag der DS Kurs eine akzeptable Erweiterung sein.",trustpilot

I think it is good to have also the practical approach but I would prefer that every student works on his or her own project and not the every student works on the same project.

Tasks do require time so one needs to be organized to make this happen.,trustpilot
2882,Careerfoundry,2025-05-21,"To be honest, I was a bit skeptical in the beginning. This course isn’t like traditional learning — there are no live classes or daily lectures. Instead, you’re mostly working independently, going through lessons on your own, reading, researching, and completing tasks one by one. Yes, you do have a mentor and a tutor, and they’re helpful when you need support or feedback. But still, you’re responsible for your daily progress, which can feel both empowering and overwhelming. Before I enrolled, I read some reviews saying the course is “too easy” or “boring.” Personally, as someone who doesn’t come from an IT or digital background, I wouldn’t call it easy. It’s actually challenging in a good way — it pushes you to think, apply what you learn, and complete real projects. I got stuck on 2 or 3 tasks and even felt frustrated at times. But I managed to push through, and that gave me more confidence. It’s definitely not impossible to understand, but you have to be self-disciplined and motivated. Right now, I’m in the middle of the course, so I’m still not 100% sure if it will be worth it in the end. I’m especially curious about the job coaching phase, which starts once you complete 51% of the course. For context, I’m based in Berlin, and my goal is to find a job in digital marketing. So far, things are going well. The course content is satisfying, and I’ve already started to take on some freelance jobs for people around me — which is a great sign that I’m learning useful skills.",trustpilot

I’ve felt supported every step of the way—and I’m gaining real, practical skills I can use in the field.",trustpilot
2885,Careerfoundry,2025-05-13,"I’m currently enrolled in the full-time Product Design course at CareerFoundry, and overall, it’s been a positive experience. I specifically chose this program for its flexible, self-paced structure, which lets me learn on my own schedule while staying on track with weekly assignments. The dashboard design breaks the material into small, manageable sections, helping me stay motivated without feeling overwhelmed. The hands-on projects are a great way to apply what you’re learning, and if you put yourself out there, you can build a student community for extra support. That said, one area where I think CareerFoundry could improve is in offering more personal interaction with tutors. While weekly video calls with mentors are helpful, tutors—who are more directly involved with your assignments—are only reachable via written feedback or chat messages. Having occasional video or phone calls with tutors could really enhance the learning experience and clarify feedback more effectively. Overall, it’s a well-structured program best suited for motivated, independent learners who appreciate flexibility but would benefit from a bit more real-time interaction.",trustpilot

I finished it, but it doesn't provide you with anything better than watching a youtube tutorial in the eyes of a potential employer.

2897,Careerfoundry,2024-03-06,"Currently about halfway through CF´s Digital Marketing course: + Positive and encouraging communication from Career Foundry´s student advisors. + The tutor and mentor I have been paired up with are really helpful. + Great to have call access to a Professional Mentor throughout the course. + Most lessons are informative, entertaining with overall good resources. + Overall nice curriculum design. + Nice to be able to see the course progress, have access to other students´ submissions as well. Where they can improve: - The major problem I faced is that some of the lessons explaining Wordpress, Mailchimp, Google Analytics are out of date ( they refer to old versions of these platforms), and as a student this is quite frustrating and confusing and completely defeats the purpose of the learning it through the course. - Quite a few of the linked resources (articles, extra readings etc) are outdated / not relevant to the platforms etc and should be updated. - As someone who gets access to the course through the Arbeitsamt ( German Employment Office) the 6 month post-course completion where CF would assist you with their Job Guarantee unfortunately does not apply. Personal Recommendations: - Could be a nice option to be able to talk to the tutor ( not only the mentor) as they oversee all the main exercises. Takeaway: Overall I´ve had a positive experience so far, have been learning well and would recommend it to potential students.",trustpilot

Beautiful portfolio & executive career advisory are the cherry 🍒 on pie. Thank you, Career Foundry! I really enjoyed this time.

2905,Careerfoundry,2023-04-10,"This is an honest review from a graduate who finished in May, 2023. Sorry, but it's definitely not the quality I expected. The job guarantee is a joke, forget it. You never get your money back. I am very disappointed after the program when I realized how little value the certification has on the job market and among employers. The company has a fantastic Marketing team, but that's it. Don't believe everything they post on their website and blogs. It's just not true. The value is zero after graduation. Nobody cares about the projects built and you won't find a job, not even for under 20k€ a year. The course itself was okay, but the investment stands in no relation to the job market and present situation out there. Many fresh devs have no other choice than to take a voluntary internship (if somebody hires you). You will by 99% don't get a job, your applications will be mainly ignored, if you don't have a computer science degree and a few years of relevant work experience as a developer yet. Mentor and tutor support is also very poor, although after three changes my third mentor was superb. I was just lucky. Otherwise you will probably get stuck in the course at some point as it gets difficult for at least 1,5 years if no longer. It's impossible to finish the course as a career changer without support from the assiged tutor in 3-6 month. For those who have already completed an acedemic degree in the field of IT with 1-2 years of relevant work experience, yes, it's gonna be a terrific course to sharpen your skills and specialize in. Otherwise, please keep your fingers away. 9000€ for the bootcamp is too pricy, rather invest in a university degree or consider another choice, if there's no time management issue. Don't believe stories like a taxi driver can make it in 3-9 month to a highly in demand Frontend or Fullstack Developer. It's not true.",trustpilot
2906,Careerfoundry,2023-05-31,"I have been studying Data Analytics (DA) for more than 2 months and I can say that registering for the Program is the best decision I have made in the past few years. What I love the most is that I get so much motivation and inspiration from the fact that I am changing my life and career with every I exercise I submit. It makes me want to move on and do more and more to reach my goal in the end of the program (to find a job, of course ;). I love the stuff I'm learning and I can see how every thing I learn can be applicable in the real life. I am always looking forward to the next exercise, as after each of them I feel like I become more clever and cool. I was very surprised to learn that I am actually not so bad at math and statistics, as the exercises are created in such a way that I quickly understand what to do and how to apply it. However, it's not all about numbers, I am happy I can be creative with DA as well. I am also happy with my tutor and mentor. They are always there to help, respond quickly, and my tutor even gives me additional material to each exercise. Overall, I am more than happy and grateful to myself that I made a decision to start the program with CareerFoundry! I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to change their career or boost their knowledge in DA. Pros - Very friendly and super professional tutor and mentor. Very supportive, reply very fast and give valuable advice (and additional material). They also always encourage me and help me fight my imposter syndrome :-) - Detailed, creative, logically structured exercises, saturated with valuable information. - Amazing tasks! - Supportive student advisors, always ready to help. - Price-quality ratio is adequate. Other schools that I looked at offered shorter programs for a higher price. - Interesting cases and stories in exercises (especially in the section about visualisations). Cons - Sometimes there are small mistakes or inconsistencies which I always try to report to the Quality Assurance team. They sometimes disrupt my understanding and the workflow, and I have to ask my tutor for help, who usually agrees with me about the mistakes I find. It takes time to get a confirmation from my tutor, so I lose time. - Some sources are a bit outdated, although I understand that good sources have no expiration date.",trustpilot

2913,Careerfoundry,2020-08-19,"Programm ist inhaltlich ok, alles halt sehr oberflächlich, vieles unbrauchbar, aber der kursaufbau gut. Bei der Umsetzung, naja in meinem Fall eine tutorin, die selbst gerade in Ausbildung, teilweise selbst kein Wissen der zu nutzenden tools und Aufgaben. Der Mentor hat seine Bestimmung komplett verfehlt. Seine Aufgabe wäre es, Studenten mental auf das Berufsleben vorzubereiten, er demotivierte, machte mich klein und zeigte mir lediglich, dass ich nicht gut bin in dem was ich tue, das tat er aber sehr ausdauernd. Er ist selbst erst 5 Monate in dem Beruf tätig und ist seit dem Abschluss bei CF eben mentor dort. Der Karrierespezialist, auch keine Erfahrung in der Branche, gab sich große Mühe aber wusste auch nicht wirklich, worüber wir reden sollten oder wo er mich hinführen sollte. Er war auch nicht motiviert, sich mal von sich aus bei mir zu melden, einfach mal fragen wie es mir geht nach 20, 30, 50, 70 Absagen.... generell gibt CF IMMER dem Studenten die Schuld. Es liegt am Lebenslauf, am portfolio, an der Motivation, an den Farben, der Ästhetik, der Zahl der Bewerbungen, Kritikfähigkeit, Formulierungen, Nase, whatever, Schuld ist der Student. Wenn er keinen job kriegt, macht er was falsch. CF vermittelt auch keine Jobs, die haben keine Kontakte in die Industrie. Null. Der Abschluss ist in der Industrie nicht sonderlich anerkannt, ""so ne Maßnahme vom Amt halt""... Da macht es keinen Unterschied, da kann sich der absolvent auf den Kopf stellen, einen job kriegt er jedenfalls nicht. Ausgeschlossen. Außer natürlich man hat schon Erfahrung als Grafikdesigner, o. Ä., diese Leute werden einem immer als ""Maßstab unter die Nase gehalten. Alles in allem, ich würde es kein zweites mal machen.

2933,Code institute,2025-02-04,"My sincere recommendation is to NEVER buy this course! The videos were recorded many years ago with irrelevant information and using old versions of libraries, which only creates a lot of problems. The material on the platform is hard to understand. Slack with thousands of channels is just a waste of time. And if you want to get help from technical mentors, you always have to answer a few questions to a chatbot. And if the answer is not comprehensive, you will be denied help. Sessions with a mentor are absolutely useless, because they don't help you with your code, they just tell you to Google it. On the platform, important information is presented in gray text, which is difficult to read. So it's better to use another course, because this one doesn't really aim to give you knowledge, but only to rip you off and not do their part in return.",trustpilot
2934,Code institute,2025-02-01,"My experience at the Code Institute was unbeatable. The course is very demanding but you can progress through the course at your own pace as long as you meet the project deadlines. At the end of the course you leave with 5 projects ready to put in your portfolio and show your work to recruiters and future employers. You also have to work well on the projects as they are personal (not in a team) and this forces you to focus and move forward even though you have the help of the Slack community, mentors and tutor. Something unique and interesting about the Code Institute is the possibility to participate in hackathons and meet new people in the projects you have to work on for 5 days and practice working in a group with tools like Github or using Agile. The possibility of doing a specialisation is something that I really enjoyed because it allowed me to develop my final project in an area in which I wanted to develop my skills more and go deeper in this area.",trustpilot

2991,Code institute,2024-06-10,Everything was easy and smooth,trustpilot
2992,Code institute,2024-07-01,"At the time of enrollment, the content was extremely outdated (no Flexbox or grid for HTML/CSS, the libraries used for the Advanced Front End project were from 3 years ago, the authentication method is not aligned with the HTTP standard -and nobody was able to explain to me how it works because the tutorial is just a code along with no real explanation of this-, and the Django tutorial was disappointing, to the point that even using the same project, the course was recently changed 100%). When I approached tutoring, they were not able to help me most of the time, because they follow the templates on the tutorials, therefore, if the student tries to come up with something new for her/his project or even use the updated version of the libraries/frameworks, they are not able to help you. Probably it was a matter of bad luck, that I got into the course right before the content was updated, but I paid the same amount of money as the student enrolling 3 months after me. On the other hand, if the student has doubts about the content or wants to go deeper into a topic, there is no one to help you. In the end, there is almost nothing more than the content and being able to use the community on Slack (which IMHO is not worth thousands of Euros). If you decide to enroll, I would advise you to stick to the tutorials as much as possible when creating the projects. Change one or two things to have a pass, and create an awesome README for merit. If you would like to probably have distinction (because the criteria are not clear) try coming up with something new but simple, and write an extremely clean code. If you need a diploma, Code Institute is a good option. But if not, I would recommend buying Udemy courses (which are not more than €18… never pay the higher amount, there are discount codes all over the internet, just Google it). There is no other advantage; at least the Udemy courses are usually updated as soon as there is a new version of the frameworks (speaking about the Django, Javascript, and React courses I needed to buy to complete the course). If you have doubts, most of the courses give you access to a Discord server where, sometimes, even the creator of the course answers questions, no matter if they are part of the content or not. NOTES: 1. It seems like CI is going through a change in almost everything. But, my experience was not good. I hope they manage to sort everything out, which is a lot. 2. Student Care and the facilitators (at least the one I had) are extremely supportive, but the internal politics seem to have them hands-tied in helping you have a better learning experience.",trustpilot

The videos are very well-done and professional, although there are moments where I wish the background music could be quieter, and perhaps the music choice wasnt the best (the music was nice and uplifting, but its taking away focus/attention from the listener). The instructions in the challenges are very clear and precise.. Although I'd say its almost too precise, the description pretty much tell me to copy paste the code and there are comments that tell me exactly where to put the codes from the descriptions 🤣. Also in lesson 5, the voice narrator and the content in the video wasnt in the same context (I'm guessing the video that was recorded and the voice narrator was by 2 different persons)",trustpilot

We had daily assignments and a test - all very doable. It helped to see if I had really absorbed the day's lessons and it was also an incentive to keep going. I appreciated that we had a community to help each other out and have a sense of community even though this challenge was only for a week.

Everything works perfectly, and it's evident that a lot of effort has been put into ensuring a smooth learning experience for students. However, it's worth noting that the course can be quite demanding at times, leading to a bit of stress.

The course content proved to be comprehensive, providing a solid foundation for grasping essential concepts and translating them into real-world applications. The robust support system, encompassing the vibrant Slack community, dedicated tutor assistance, and insightful mentorship, significantly contributed to my learning journey. I must commend the efforts of the facilitators whose dedication to creating an engaging and supportive learning environment was truly commendable. Their guidance played a pivotal role in enhancing the overall educational experience. Post-course completion, the assistance provided by the Career Support team was nothing short of remarkable. Their insights into industry trends, effective resume building, and practical career advice were invaluable as I transitioned into the professional sphere. While my overall experience was highly positive, I believe there is always room for improvement. Specifically, I suggest a closer look at refining the learning materials for an even more seamless understanding. Additionally, providing clearer justification for assessment objectives could enhance the transparency of the evaluation process.

It gave an easy overview to HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the applications and differences for a total novice as myself. It did feel a little like I was copying parrot fashion.

3065,Code institute,2023-11-27,"It was made a little bit too easy, because you could see almost every solution in the youtube video, which was shown before every task. But ofcourse, in real life, you also google 20x per hour for some solutions. So, it was really interesting to do, and what would be nice, would be more different projects, so you can choose which project you want to do. And sometimes i wrote a word like ""onion"" with ""Onion"" and it didnt accept that. or maybe it wasn't onion but it was any coding word and i had to write it the same like the solution wanted it as requirements, so i had the programm running perfectly, but one word was written with a big letter at beginning and that wasn't accepted, what took me some time to understand the problem :D in the end, it was interesting to do, i got some exp. in that from that, if i want to do this, and i want to do this, and in the end, at the phone call, after i completed the 5 day coding challenge, the person was also very nice and helpful, and funny :D HAHA because he always said like a robot, like he has to say that, ""yes marin, you are totally right"" or something loike that :D xD but it was fun :D thanks alot! i will continue with this course, and hopefully i can be one day, a real software developer junior /assistant .

3068,Code institute,2023-11-27,"I recently completed the 5DCC challenge focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here’s my straightforward take: 1. Challenge’s Difficulty: For beginners, the challenge seemed too basic, lacking depth and complexity needed to truly engage or challenge. 2. Relevance of Tasks: The tasks felt outdated for 2023. Web design and development have evolved far beyond the concepts presented in the challenge, making it seem somewhat disconnected from current industry trends. 3. Lecture Format: Pre-recorded lectures significantly underperform compared to live webinars. While live sessions might be less convenient for some, they offer richer, real-time learning experiences. The inclusion of recorded sessions for those unable to attend live could be a balanced approach. 4. Outdated Content: The material, evidently not updated for over a year, misses the mark in delivering fresh, up-to-date insights crucial for tech learning. 5. Overall Impression for Prospective Students: The experience over these five days shapes one’s perception of the entire Code Institute’s curriculum. Live interaction and a more current syllabus would likely leave a more favorable impression. 6. Expectations from Code Institute: I’m hopeful and confident that Code Institute’s full program is far more relevant and in-depth than what this challenge portrayed. However, the experience of these five days should better reflect the quality and modernity of the institute’s offering.",trustpilot

3071,Code institute,2023-11-13,"There was a video for each unit and procedures were explained and then you had to apply them. The learning method didn't work for me.

Then I had to watch the video again because I realized while programming that I was missing important information. It would have been much better if I had had a document where I could read everything I needed. Or even better a chatbot to answer my questions. At the end, you are supposed to print out your certificate yourself, but the link didn't work. The idea of a coding challenge with one hour of work per day is nice, though.",trustpilot

The challenges were not too challenging and if you watched the videos and read the explanations properly, everything could be solved quite easily. I'd love to dive deeper! I also loved the flexibility. If you couldn't make it in time on each day, it was possible to complete the challenges during the following days. The community chat was also a cool way to support fellow learners or get support from them. I just had some issues with the certificate since my name isn't stated on it and haven't gotten any support yet after reaching out. But I'm sure that problem is going to be solved.",trustpilot

Overall it was just a bit too easy for me, I would have wished for a little less ""hand holding"". It was awesome that I felt like I can make my own website after this short course, which is really awesome! In the end, some more detailed information, on why some answers are correct or may be done differently, would be the cherry on top.

3140,Code institute,2023-07-10,"It was the sincere and altruistic desire to help people and advance the cause of web development that I loved most in CI's purpose of the 5DCC. The structure of programme's delivery was also detailed and functional. I will suggest that a 30 minutes virtual Programme Recap session with participants be added going forward to highlight next steps. I know other communication touch on this but some emphasis from verbal communication may be lacking as is presently. Thank you very much for your efforts here, and all of that for free! 🙏",trustpilot
3141,Code institute,2023-07-02,"Great course for complete beginners. Although they covered many aspects, I still feel a few basics were left out, but what more can they cover in 5 days? What I like most is the way of learning and the different coding challenges along the way.",trustpilot
3142,Code institute,2023-06-25,"The lectures were very detailed, very understandable, everything was chewed up to the details, but the tests failed in some places. I just got stuck for half an hour to find an error, which consisted in the fact that I put an extra space.",trustpilot

Would totally recommend. -1 star because of some inconsistencies between the information given in the videos and the activities themselves. Nothing gamebreaking, however it does draws the course away from a perfect 5 stars.",trustpilot
3150,Code institute,2023-06-11,"I was interested in learning coding for a while but I never started. I wanted to give it a try and it was absolutely worth it! Even with no experience I almost understood everything. It was very helpful that the videos were scripted, so i could also re-read sentences or look up words i didn't know (i am b1-b2 level English). To learn it on creating a website was really interesting and seeing the progress you make is great. The step by step learning made it easy to understand how it works and you didn't get overwhelmed. It was ""just the basic input"", but you already learned for example how to make the website adjustable to every screen-size. I was so glad that I gave it a try, I would absolutely recommend it.",trustpilot
3151,Code institute,2023-06-11,I found the 5-Day Challenge very helpful for those people who don't know what programming is or how to create a simple layout. Detailed explanations help to understand everything even for beginners like me :-),trustpilot
3152,Code institute,2023-06-11,"I really like the way the videos are explained, the Theory was easy to understand, I like that when you are coding and you test the code you recive a windows that says if you have a error and give a hint where the error must be, and the Slack portal was really great too beacuse it makes the experience more interactrive with other students.",trustpilot
3153,Code institute,2023-06-11,"The 5 day Challenge, was indeed challenging. It took me a bit of extra time to understand what I was supposed to do but in the end I managed to make myself proud.

3158,Code institute,2023-05-14,"It was very interesting to see how a website is built and how http, css and javascript work hand in hand. The challenge itself was a bit too easy. Too often you just had to insert ready-made lines without thinking for yourself.",trustpilot

I would be happy to advance further in this course. I am also excited I got a certificate as a reward for participating in the challenge.",trustpilot
3163,Code institute,2023-04-30,"While the challenge you were taken step by step through the topics and could also read what you’ve heard on the right side of the instruction videos (for me, German speaking, who talks not that often in english, it was perfect). Everything was explained understandable and if you’ve had problems while the projects you could watch the videos again and again. When you’ve made a mistake you were pointed out on what was wrong and you could try it so often you needed it. When there was help necessary you could go on “slack” and ask your questions there. It was a great experience for me, because I never coded before!",trustpilot
3164,Code institute,2023-04-27,It was a great experience. I already have had contact points with Web development so the 5DCC wasnt that difficult.

3169,Code institute,2023-04-09,"I had no previous exposure to programming. I recommend the 5 Day Coding Challenge. It's free of charge and you don't need any previous experience. The explanatory videos are easy to follow and the exercises were easy to understand. If something didn't work out, you were immediately helped in the community that you were allowed to join as part of the challenge. It would have been cool to get a list of programs and websites at the end of the challenge that you can use for further coding. Since I want to continue programming as a hobby and not yet think about a career in that field. All in all a cool experience!",trustpilot

3175,Code institute,2023-04-09,"Hello World, Am Reuben Junior and a 5DCC Participant and Student. From the first time, I heard about code Institute and reading about their course outlines, I was inspired to dive into it. I tried to test myself with this 5 Day Challenge Course. I putted all myself into the Programm and I got something beneficial about my upskills and life direction into tech, although I already had a little experience, but not specifically into this field of coding. After the Challenge Course, I am now more encouraged and motivated by the Code Institute Programm Team to further the Course to take up the Full Stack Software Development. I will therefore encourage each and everyone one who wish to upskill or start afresh to first take up the 5 Day Challenge Course to try his or her ability and if possible further it to take up the Full-Stack course.

3191,Code institute,2023-02-19,"I've tried the 5 Day Coding Challenge to get back into coding after ten years and I'm positively surprised! Code Institute implemented a lot of useful videos (each with ""subtitles"" at the side) for each day and it only uses up to one hour per day. Even less, if you've already got some experience. It covers HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics. While taking part in each challenge there's a little tool that tells you whether or not you've gotten all the assignments correct. If you don't have something correct it gives you a tip on what to do. Although the tip is not that great because it only says: „Did you make an XXX command? Does it have YYY?“, which isn't very helpful in my opinion. But if you're stuck you can join a group for the five days where you can get help from a professional and/or talk to fellow challengers! Also, if you don't get around to finish all of your challenges within the five day period don't worry! In my case they automatically stretched my access to the course until the end of the weekend! Tldr; it's a really great resource and I recommend it to anyone interested in coding!",trustpilot

3219,Code institute,2023-01-01,"It started with the onboarding call. I already have some experience with programming and I was trying to get information if I would benefit from joining code institute. The person I spoke to didn't have any technical knowledge, which is understandable - the program is set up for people with zero experience. But instead of helping me, he merely shifted me to the five day coding challenge... Which I already knew was going to be a waste of time. But I decided to play along since maybe I would be able to speak to someone else. In the coding challenge we were all set up in a slack group. There, again, I asked to speak about my concerns, but my question was left unanswered. And so were my other questions regarding the autograder. All I got were canned responses to talk to onboarding people. The whole system (from what I was able to experience up to that point) is set up in such a way it takes people in and spits them out. There's no room for independent thought / solving edge cases. I say this having the experience of talking to two other institutions where I was able to get my questions escalated to people who could talk to me. And in one of those cases I was able to talk to an instructor where we came to the conclusion that particular bootcamp wouldn't be right for me. I was not able to get that from code institute.",trustpilot

The only problem which is not exactly a problem, and it depends on the person is that there is a lot of details that hasn't been talked about. I know that lessons will be so boring with all the details, but it's good to be mentioned somewhere that it's not all. giving a reference for the ones to know more or something like that, will help people to learn better I guess.",trustpilot

Now, it could be me since I've had a very very small prior knowledge to coding, but I can see how it could be a bit overwhelming for some beginners. However, it's very friendly, very straight forward, and the instruction videos also provide tons of help explaining what to do, and also showing how to do it and the results. Not only that, but they've provided references to a site in which you can ask others that are doing the challenges too to help you in case you get stuck. I didn't use that, but it's always an incredible tool nonetheless to have. Totally reccomend.",trustpilot

3286,Code institute,2020-10-19,Nice course but I would have expected the learning platform to work better. It kept crashing and sometimes the teaching videos were a bit chaotic.

3300,Code institute,2020-03-09,"The 5 day coding course was really helpful and fun. The videos were helpful, but sometimes critical information was not stressed, causing confusion for solving the challenges. Also, sometimes there seems to be a glitch which doesn't allow for the test to be passed even though it was correctly coded (after several attempts of running the test and getting failed results I copied the coding and reset the workspace and pasted it in again- then all of a sudden it worked). Another thing I think could be improved is the order of the run -test posts when you check if you have passed the various coding tests for one challenge- they are not in the order of how they are presented in the instructions from the teacher- if it would have been, it would be even more pedagogical! But otherwise, I can really recommend this mini course for someone who wants to try out coding! Thank you, Code Institute :)",trustpilot

3308,Masterschool,2025-06-09,"BIn im 14-monate Programm und kann nicht nachvollziehen wie der Preis von krassen 47.000 Euro zu rechtfertigen ist: die ersten drei - vier Monate gab es pro Woche drei Tage an denen in zwei Einheiten insgesamt 135 min ""unterrichtet"" wurde. Nun im Cloud track, gibt es 60 min Intro session pro Woche und der Rest ist eine checkliste die abgearbeitet werden soll..Das Lernmaterial ist ein udemy kurs der meistens 12 euro kostet und links zu Youtube Videos sowie ein Lernspiel von Amazon.. Was zum Fuck.. Ich habe eine liebe SSM, die sich Mühe gibt aber ich bin Maßlos enttäuscht und werde das Gefühl nicht los dass hier nur ein weiteres Unternehmen staatliche Förderung abgreift. Beim rekrutieren ist das Bild einer Schule gezeichnet worden. Das hat sich in der Praxis nicht bestätigt . Für Menschen ohne Vorerfahrung in diesen Bereichen( WAS ABER GENAU SO BEWORBEN WIRD) ist das Programm überhaupt nicht geeignet. im zweiten Monat gab es bereits einen Hackathon bei dem eine API benutzt werden sollte, das Lernmodul dazu kommt aber erst im 5 Monat ...LOL. In boot camps ist das pensum traditionell überwältigt, aber dieses ist sein Geld nicht wert. Meiner Meinung nach gehört Masterschool die Lizenz entzogen, zumindest für den Clod track. Die Lehrer und Mentoren empfehlen statt den Lehrern erstmal anderen Teilnehmerinnen ihre Fragen zu stellen. Einerseits verstehe ich den Sinn dahinter anderseits kommt es in Kombination mit der dünnen Betreuung rüber als würden sie einen abwimmeln. In den Sessions ist keine Zeit zum Fragen, auch komplexe themen werden nicht ausreichend behandelt und es wird nur rübergewischt und dann direkt zum nächsten Thema gesprungen. Ich habe zudem festgestellt das teilweise ganze Absätze aus dem Lernmaterial 1:1 bei kostenlosen Websites zu finden sind... Nochmal Wo bitte sind 47Tsd Euro da legitimiert ? Dann kommen noch technische Probleme hinzu die m.E bei einer ""IT-school"" nicht vorkommen sollten. Ich hätte noch mehr Kritikpunkte, aber das hier reicht hoffentlich um dem Abraten von dieser Institution zu begründen.. Im übrigen habe ich hier schonmal die Bewertungen anderer gelesen und mir ist aufgefallen, dass kommentare fehlen - die negativen - interesting...",trustpilot

3310,Masterschool,2025-06-04,"Ich bin sehr dankbar, dass ich die Möglichkeit zur Weiterbildung bei Masterschool erhalten habe. Als Quereinsteigerin aus dem kaufmännischen Bereich war mein Einstieg in die Welt des Programmierens eine echte Herausforderung. Der Umgang mit Python, GitHub, logischem und analytischem Denken sowie das Zerlegen komplexer Aufgaben in kleine programmierbare Schritte fühlte sich zunächst wie ein steiler Berg an. Besonders zu Beginn waren die vielen neuen Begriffe und Konzepte schwer zu greifen – oft fehlte mir der Gesamtzusammenhang. Das hat meine Entwicklung zwar verlangsamt und viel Energie gekostet, doch mit der Zeit hat sich alles gefügt. Heute, neun Monate später, blicke ich mit Zufriedenheit und großer Freude auf meine Entscheidung zurück, diesen Weg gegangen zu sein. Was mir besonders geholfen hat, war die großartige Unterstützung durch das Team: Manuela, Rawi, Thomas, Suzan und Riccardo standen mir mit Geduld, Motivation und verständlichen Erklärungen wirklich täglich zur Seite. Ohne sie hätte ich viele Hürden nicht überwinden können. Das Vollzeit-Programm ist zudem sehr familienfreundlich. Es wird Rücksicht darauf genommen, wenn man für einzelne Aufgaben mehr Zeit benötigt. Auch der Austausch mit anderen Studierenden macht das Lernen lebendig, motivierend und einfach schön. Nach sechs Monaten intensiven Lernens mit Python habe ich mich für den Cloud-Track entschieden – und bin begeistert. Die Aufgaben machen Spaß und geben einem das Gefühl, tatsächlich eine Programmiererin zu sein. Diese Weiterbildung hat mir die Tür zur IT-Welt geöffnet. Es gibt noch so viel zu entdecken und zu lernen, und ich freue mich darauf, diesen Weg weiterzugehen. Ein Hinweis für andere Teilnehmende: Auch wenn der Kurs auf Deutsch ist, sind viele Aufgaben auf Englisch. Es ist daher hilfreich, zumindest Grundkenntnisse in der englischen Sprache mitzubringen. Ich kann Masterschool jedem empfehlen, der bereit ist, sich neuen Herausforderungen zu stellen und sich weiterzuentwickeln. Es lohnt sich!",trustpilot

Die 22.000 fur die 8 Monate und 37.000 für 14 Monate sind nicht im geringsten gerechtfertigt. Masterschool verwendet swhr viel Energie darauf seine Studenten zu einer 5 Sterne Bewertung zu bewegen. Ich möchte es so formulieren. Das hier dargestellte Ranking entspricht meiner Ansicht nach nocht im geringsten der durchschnittlichen Erfahrung der Kursteilnehmer. Solltest du blutiger Anfänger im coding sein, wird das sehr sehrt sehr hart hier mitzuhalten. Nachtrag: Masterschool hat hier binnen 48h Kontakt aufgenommen. Während des Kurses haz es teilweise Wochen gedauert eine Antwort zu bekommen. Man scheint aber schnell bei schlechter Bewertung zu reagieren. Ich korrigiere mein Bewertung denoch auf 2 Sterne wegen meines ersten Mentors aus den Core Modulen. Tasos hat mich immer sehr unterstützt umd ohne ihn, wäre der Kurs sein Geld nichr wert gewesen.

I gained more practice, experience, and confidence. Being part of a group with shared goals helped me feel less alone, and direct contact with industry experts gave me real insight into the role. Technically, Masterschool did a good job, and I personally think they could do even better if they raised their standards in delivering the material. I believe they can become a leader in the industry. Career advisors and support were the best parts. They were consistently helpful, truly listened, and gave guidance that made a real difference. They understood my challenges and helped me improve. Overall, Masterschool’s support kept me focused and confident.

Immerhin kannte ich das Unternehmen nicht und wusste auch nicht, wie vertrauenswürdig es war. Jetzt kommt wahrscheinlich die Frage auf, wie ich überhaupt dazu kam. In einem Video vom Youtuber Simplicissimus haben sie Werbung für das Unternehmen gemacht. Also dachte ich mir, schau doch mal rein. Just for fun habe ich mich beworben und dachte, auf gut Glück wird es was, oder nicht. Und es wurde mehr als das. Schon kurze Zeit später kontaktierte mich ein Personal Manager und riet mir zum Einsteigerkurs. Der geht einen Monat und ist ein kurzer Einblick in die 3 großen Bereiche, die Masterschool anbietet - Software Engineering, Cybersicherheit und Datenanalyse. Der Start war ein bisschen holprig, weil ich weder gesponserten Laptop, noch irgendwelche Startdaten hatte, aber beim Nachfragen und erkundigen zwischen dem Personal Couch und mir, verlief doch noch alles glatt. Auch unser Dozent war ein sehr freundlicher Mann. Er hat alles gut erklärt, auch verständlich anschaulich gemacht und hatte auch ein Ohr für meine privaten Schwierigkeiten. Man hat einfach rundum gemerkt, das Masterschool (obwohl es hier nur ein einmonatiger Orientierungskurs war) wollte, dass du bestehst und dich wohl fühlst.

The courses were held by a variety of industry experts who taught their specific fields but also gave first-hand insights from their own experiences, which made the classes feel really alive. We had a mixture of live classes, Masterschool material, and also free access to third-party material for further study. All this was rounded up by practical projects that had to be done either in groups or alone. The projects covered the theoretical material, and with them, you can make sure that you are able to apply the concepts in real-world scenarios. I would do the course again and can happily recommend it.",trustpilot
3433,Masterschool,2025-01-12,"Masterschool, from what I know, is a relatively new program. I participated in the Cybersecurity program. You can tell that the team behind it is genuinely trying their best to create a program that caters to everyone’s needs while constantly striving for improvement on all levels. I had a positive experience and felt like I learned a lot. There was a clear timeframe for completing tasks, which made me feel like I was part of a structured process. However, it’s important to note that self-learning is a crucial aspect of programs like this and will take up the majority of your time. I’m not sure if other programs operate differently, but this seems to be the standard approach. Engaging in online education requires self-discipline, motivation, and a genuine desire to learn. Nobody will hold your hand and explain things step by step as if teaching children. This is something many people seemed disappointed by. Of course, there were areas for improvement—perhaps more recap sessions or a better mentor in my case. That said, there were excellent mentors available, and many participants were genuinely grateful for them. Overall, Masterschool was a solid platform. I could rely on receiving officially recognised certifications, a laptop to complete my studies (which I kept afterward), 24/7 support for questions, access to platforms, daily sessions and other resources. I’m happy with my experience at Masterschool. It opened the door to a career in Cybersecurity, showed me where to learn, and introduced me to the tools I need to continue on this path independently.",trustpilot
3434,Masterschool,2025-01-12,"After many successful years in online marketing, I decided in 2024 to expand my career into Data Analytics & Business Intelligence. Data has always been a part of my work, but I wanted to take the bold step of making it the core of my profession. I compared several educational programs but ultimately chose Masterschool. Their significantly longer program duration (7 months), the diverse topics, and the practical projects convinced me more than the typical 12-week courses. Throughout my studies, I had the opportunity to work with professional instructors who explained even complex topics in an understandable way. Special thanks go to our SQL instructor, Thimo, who has an exceptional ability to make intricate concepts easy to grasp. Without him, my SQL skills wouldn't be where they are today. I’m equally grateful to Zerihun, who took on the challenge of teaching the fundamentals of Tableau and dashboard design clearly and engagingly within a short time. The course content was perfectly tailored to real-world business demands. Core areas included scripting languages like SQL, Python, and Pandas, BI & Data Visualization, and database management. Through three hands-on projects—both in teams and individually—we tackled larger data challenges, wrote complex code, and always benefited from Masterschool’s immense support. Masterschool’s course content on its own learning platform for Python, SQL, and all project-related topics was excellent, with weekly challenges and quizzes setting the pace and measuring learning progress. Every day included live sessions and self-directed learning. The digital campus homepage made it easy to navigate your own learning journey, offering full-service support, recordings and documentation of all sessions, helpful resources, and access to various partner websites like DataCamp and Coursera. A special highlight was the mentoring program. Tatyana Godunova consistently supported me throughout this demanding journey, both mentally and professionally. She encouraged me to stay focused, go the extra mile, and never give up. She was always available for technical questions, and her lectures—along with those by Thimo, Zerihun, and Stavros—were among the best. Masterschool also actively supported my career development. Career Coach Fareen Shaikh prepared us through intensive sessions on imposter syndrome, CV and LinkedIn optimization, motivation letter writing, job searching, and interview preparation. We also benefited from mock interviews and valuable feedback from various career instructors during our job readiness phase. Even after completing the program, I was supported by Abigail Fried, a professional Career Advisor from Masterschool. She provided me with valuable feedback on my applications, helped me set weekly goals, and continuously encouraged me during the challenging job search process. Anyone considering the Data Analytics program at Masterschool should be aware that it requires a high level of commitment, self-initiative, and engagement to successfully complete the course and tackle the subsequent challenge of job hunting. The course content is intensive and compact, and depending on the topic, it’s essential to independently deepen your knowledge—especially in tools like Tableau—to build a truly solid foundation. Since the job market is saturated with many Data Analytics bootcamp graduates, it's important to choose a focus area early on, expand your expertise, and work on additional projects to strengthen your portfolio. Overall, Masterschool was an experience I wouldn’t want to miss—and it ultimately helped me land my first job in Data Analytics. *Please note that I was part of the last cohort of the 7-month training program, which has now been extended to a 14-month program in Germany.",trustpilot

The program is well-designed, but what truly stands out is the incredible mentorship that comes with it. I’m so thankful to have Noam Rivlin as my mentor. His commitment, understanding, and unwavering support have made such a difference. He’s always on top of my progress, cheering me on every step of the way, and his guidance has made the entire process so much more manageable, both technically and emotionally. I honestly couldn’t ask for a better mentor! During our first Hackathon, I had the privilege of working with Maicon de Morais, who was simply outstanding. Even though the project was challenging for our first experience, his patience, guidance, and valuable insights kept the team motivated and focused.

3466,Masterschool,2024-12-10,"Every great journey begins with a question—a curiosity that sparks a quest for answers. For me, my story is one of discovery, growth, and finding the right path to excellence. Today, I’m proud to give Masterschool a 5-star rating, as they’ve been an integral part of my transformative journey in data analytics. Starting with a Bachelor’s in Accounting and Management, I built my career in the medical sector, rising from Finance Officer to Manager. I then transitioned to the financial sector, focusing on credit and investment operations, where I encountered a new world of possibilities hidden within the data I worked with every day. This growing curiosity about data and its potential to answer critical business questions led me to pursue a Master’s in Business Intelligence and Analytics. While I gained valuable insights from the program, I couldn’t shake the feeling of being “lightweight” in my knowledge and skills. I wanted more. I wanted mastery. That’s when I discovered Masterschool, where a tailor-made program in data analytics, perfectly aligned with my career goal. From the moment I enrolled, I knew I had made the right choice. The program’s comprehensive curriculum, hands-on learning, and industry-focused approach were exactly what I needed to deepen my expertise and build confidence in my abilities. Today, I’m halfway through the program, and I already feel like a completely different person. The tools, techniques, and real-world applications I’ve gained have given me the “weight” I was searching for—the confidence to stand firm in my chosen career path. Masterschool didn’t just teach me data analytics; it empowered me to excel and prepared me for the challenges of a dynamic and data-driven world. I wholeheartedly give Masterschool a 5-star rating, not just for the quality of the program but for how it has helped me unlock my potential. To anyone searching for the right stepping stone to build their future in data analytics, I say: look no further than Masterschool.

I'm sure there are other schools out there that provides good education. I can also tell myself that the materials given to me in Masterschool, I could have done by myself. But the difference of enrolling in Masterschool and I believe is INDISPENSABLE, is the amount of support they give you before, during and after your course. I feel essentially that this is what you pay for in the school. They will help you land that job. And I can feel with their support that it will happen. The school has good Mentors, the structure of the classes are good and the job related certificates prepare you for your future.

In addition to the technical training, Masterschool provided a range of resources to prepare us for the challenges of entering a new field. The variety of communication channels, like Slack, Bubble Chat, and access to mentors, ensured help was always available when I needed it. I particularly appreciated having a dedicated mentor who met with me weekly and provided instant support whenever I faced challenges. The sense of community was another highlight. Engaging with peers who shared similar goals through Slack created a strong network of support. Transitioning to a new career can be scary, but knowing I wasn’t alone in this journey gave me confidence and encouragement.

3475,Masterschool,2024-09-01,"When I started at Masterschool, the Cybersecurity course was completely new for Germany, and definitely had its bumps and obstacles. I choose to start at Masterschool because it seemed like the best bootcamp experience available. To this day I still think it is. I initially thought of not giving 5 stars, as there has been certain unfulfilled promises (even though they were in written format), sugar-coated realities and sometimes a decent lack of structure to the course. However, after ending the bootcamp, Masterschool has truly stepped up, and compensated for the bumpy road with extremely good follow-ups, dedication to help me land a job, extended access to learning platforms, constant check-ins to help me stay motivated in my job search, all while giving me the feeling they truly care about helping me with my career. Again, our cohort was the first Cybersecurity cohort in Germany, and Masterschool seem to truly focus on constant improvement. I therefore believe anyone starting their Cybersecurity course at this point, will have a much smoother and tailored experience. All of this dedication and willingness to help beyond the scope of the bootcamp makes Masterschool deserve a full 5 star review. That said, it should be said that the amount of personal investment in terms of time, passion and dedication from my side has been absolutely necessary. I am not exaggerating when I say I've spend 10-14 hours every single day, weekends included to get to the point where I am today, and I still feel humbled by how beautifully complex the field of Cybersecurity is. If you expect to join Masterschool, and sit back and relax while a career is handed to you, you might as well choose a different career. You truly need to take ownership over your own career and journey, and if you do, Masterschool will 100% have your back, and support you until you land that job. If you don't, then there is only so much they can do anyway. Overall, I would absolutely recommend this bootcamp if backed by a Gutschein from the Arbeitsamt. And if you do decide to start this journey - best of luck, and keep pushing! :)",trustpilot
3476,Masterschool,2024-12-05,"Bewertung der Masterschool - 05. Dezember 2024 Leider kann ich mich überhaupt nicht mit dem angebotenen Programm an der Masterschool anfreunden. Es wird kaum auf die tatsächlichen Probleme eingegangen, und das Lernkonzept hinterlässt viele Fragen. Zu Beginn hat man nur zwei Live-Sessions pro Tag, jeweils mit einer Stunde Dauer. In jeder dieser Stunden wird ein neues Thema behandelt, ohne dass genügend Zeit bleibt, um das Gelernte wirklich zu verstehen und zu verinnerlichen. Es fühlt sich an, als ob das hauptsächliche Ziel darin besteht, die monatlichen Zahlungen zu sichern, während die Qualität der Lehre eher nebensächlich erscheint. Das Programm ist sehr theoretisch, und es wird nicht ausreichend erklärt, wie und wo man das Wissen in der Praxis anwenden soll. Nach 12 Monaten soll man zwei Monate in die Praxis gehen, aber da einem nicht gezeigt wird, wie man das Gelernte konkret anwendet, weiß ich nicht, was ich in der Praxis erwarten soll. Zu Beginn wird zwar nach Grundkenntnissen gefragt, aber im weiteren Verlauf wird man ins kalte Wasser geworfen und behandelt, als hätte man bereits Vorkenntnisse. In der Plattform „TryHackMe“, einem Cybersecurity-Spiel, das für das Hackenlernen genutzt wird, muss man Aufgaben erledigen, ohne dass die Einführungsaufgaben wirklich behandelt werden. Das führt zu einem unzureichenden Verständnis des Materials. Zudem werden Aufgaben, die für 120 Minuten angesetzt sind, innerhalb von 60 Minuten abgearbeitet, was sehr kontraproduktiv ist. Ich habe das Gefühl, dass den Verantwortlichen bei der Planung der Kurse nicht bewusst ist, was sie tatsächlich den Lernenden zumuten. Würde ich eine Schulnote vergeben, würde Masterschool eine „6“ bekommen. Das einzig Positive an der Schule ist, dass ich einen verständnisvollen Mentor habe, der sich Zeit für Fragen nimmt. Leider wird bei den Live-Sessions oft mit der Antwort „Wir haben keine Zeit“ reagiert, und es wird empfohlen, eine zusätzliche Mentorstunde zu buchen. Wenn das der Fall ist, könnte ich theoretisch jeden Tag eine Mentorstunde buchen, was die Probleme nicht wirklich löst. Auch der begleitende Englischkurs lässt zu wünschen übrig. Selbst wenn man viele Fehler macht, wird man trotzdem als „bestanden“ eingestuft. Es wäre hilfreich, ein gewisses Englisch-Niveau (mindestens B1) zu haben, um mit dem Kurs klarzukommen. Ein weiteres großes Problem ist die technische Ausstattung: Den Teilnehmern werden MacBooks mit nur 256 GB SSD und 8 GB RAM zur Verfügung gestellt, die für die Installation von virtuellen Maschinen völlig ungeeignet sind. Am Ende ist der gesamte Speicher fast voll, und die Geräte sind für diese Anforderungen einfach nicht ausgelegt. Laut Apple sind diese MacBooks nicht für derartige Aufgaben konzipiert, während die Instruktoren mit Windows-Rechnern arbeiten. Wenn man versucht, über diese Probleme mit einem der Instruktoren zu sprechen, wird man leider oft ausgelacht, was den Frust nur noch verstärkt. Anstatt Unterstützung oder konstruktive Kritik zu erhalten, fühlt man sich eher ins Lächerliche gezogen, was die Situation noch unprofessioneller macht. Zusammenfassend kann ich sagen, dass ich mit der Masterschool sehr unzufrieden bin. Es fehlt an praktischer Anwendung, an einer sinnvollen Struktur und an der notwendigen Unterstützung. Ich bin jedoch bereit, mit der Masterschool über diese schlechte Bewertung zu sprechen, in der Hoffnung, dass sich die Qualität der Ausbildung verbessert. Martin",trustpilot

3493,Masterschool,2024-01-03,"Die Masterschool wirbt mit der Möglichkeit, ohne jegliche Vorkenntnisse anspruchsvolle Themengebiete zu erlernen. Doch die Realität zeigt, dass dieses Versprechen für viele Teilnehmende nur schwer einlösbar ist. Die Lernstruktur und die Organisation weisen erhebliche Defizite auf, die den Lernerfolg beeinträchtigen. Herausforderungen für Lernende ohne Vorkenntnisse Für Personen ohne Vorwissen gestaltet sich der Kurs äußerst schwierig. Die Inhalte sind komplex, und es fehlt an einer klar strukturierten Einführung in die Grundlagen. Statt die Basics („das ABC“) systematisch zu lehren, werden fortgeschrittene Themen („C“) vorangestellt, bevor die eigentlichen Grundlagen („A“ und „B“) vermittelt werden. Dieses chaotische Vorgehen führt dazu, dass viele Teilnehmende den Anschluss verlieren und überfordert sind. Unzureichende Betreuung Ein weiterer Kritikpunkt betrifft die Betreuung durch die Mentoren und Tutoren. Da diese ihren Hauptberuf haben, steht oft wenig Zeit für die Beantwortung von Fragen zur Verfügung. Es kommt vor, dass Lernende mehrere Tage auf Antworten warten müssen. Dies ist besonders frustrierend, wenn man an komplexen Aufgaben arbeitet, die oft in der vorgegebenen Zeit nicht zu bewältigen sind. Einige Aufgaben sind mit zwei Stunden angegeben, während selbst erfahrene Mentoren dafür deutlich länger benötigen würden. Hier wäre es sinnvoll, zusätzliche Ressourcen bereitzustellen, wie beispielsweise fest angestellte Tutoren, die ausschließlich für die Masterschool arbeiten. Effizienz der Live-Sitzungen Die Live-Sitzungen, die insgesamt etwa sieben Stunden pro Woche umfassen, wirken oft überladen. In den effektiv nutzbaren fünf Stunden werden Themen in einem hohen Tempo vermittelt, was es schwer macht, nachhaltig zu lernen. Zusätzlich zeigt sich, dass viele Lernende gezwungen sind, auf externe Plattformen wie YouTube oder ChatGPT zurückzugreifen, um die Inhalte überhaupt zu verstehen. Dies wirft die Frage auf, warum ein kostenintensiver Kurs nötig ist, wenn das Selbststudium über frei verfügbare Ressourcen häufig effizienter ist. Unfaire Lerndynamik Ein auffälliges Problem ist die unterschiedliche Lernfortschrittsrate innerhalb der Klassen. Erfahrungsberichte zeigen, dass etwa ein Drittel der Teilnehmenden den Stoff relativ schnell versteht, während der Rest wochenlang hinterherhinkt. Dieses Muster ist nicht nur in einzelnen Kursen zu beobachten, sondern zieht sich offenbar durch mehrere Kohorten. Dies zeigt, dass die Lernstruktur nicht auf die Bedürfnisse der Mehrheit der Teilnehmenden zugeschnitten ist. Vorteile der Masterschool Trotz der genannten Herausforderungen gibt es einige Vorteile: 1. Flexibilität: Der Kurs kann von zu Hause aus absolviert werden. 2. Zugang zu Lernmaterialien:Alle Sitzungen werden aufgezeichnet und sind jederzeit abrufbar. 3. MacBook als Anreiz:Auch wenn das Gerät nicht „kostenlos“ ist, sondern im Kurspreis enthalten, wird es als praktisches Werkzeug zur Verfügung gestellt. 4. Netzwerk: Viele Teilnehmende berichten von bereichernden Bekanntschaften mit Mitschülerinnen und Mitschülern, die oft hilfreicher sind als die offizielle Betreuung. Fazit Die Masterschool ist vor allem für Lernende mit Vorkenntnissen geeignet, die sich eigenständig durch anspruchsvolle Themen arbeiten können. Für Anfänger oder Personen ohne jegliches Vorwissen ist das Angebot jedoch nicht empfehlenswert. Die Organisation sollte dringend an der Struktur des Curriculums, der Betreuungskapazität und der Transparenz hinsichtlich des tatsächlichen Aufwands arbeiten. Angesichts der hohen Kurskosten wirkt der Nutzen des Programms im Vergleich zu frei zugänglichen Ressourcen wie YouTube oder ChatGPT fragwürdig. Bewertung: 2/5 Sternen Positiv hervorzuheben sind die Flexibilität und die Möglichkeit, wertvolle Kontakte zu knüpfen. Allerdings überwiegen die strukturellen und organisatorischen Mängel, sodass der Kurs sein Versprechen, für alle Wissenstände geeignet zu sein, nicht einhalten kann.",trustpilot
3494,Masterschool,2024-11-14,"My journey with Masterschool has been transformative in many ways. Before starting, I already had a solid interest in tech but limited formal training in software development. Masterschool provided a structured environment to truly immerse myself in the world of coding, with a focus on hands-on projects and real-world challenges. One of the biggest challenges I faced was transitioning from a background in logistics and customer service to mastering technical concepts like backend development, API creation, and database management. This was a steep learning curve, but the support I received from the Masterschool community and instructors made a world of difference.

Initially, it was confusing to dive directly into coding, and I often felt overwhelmed, especially when dealing with complex topics. There were many moments when I struggled with imposter syndrome, questioning whether I was really cut out for this career change. However, throughout the program, I received invaluable support from my mentor, which was crucial for my progress. Their guidance helped me to understand difficult concepts, and I also took the initiative to teach myself through additional research and self-learning.

The instructors are very knowledgable and the oppertunities for growth, even as a student, are vast! There is regular encouragement for students to keep going, which I have found to be key for many classmates trying to pivot from their current careers to a new field. I did find that towards the end of my program, there was a stagnation and reduction in what was once a very tightly knit community, no a family, but this is also likely as a result of several external reason. I would greatly recommend this program for those looking to learn and switch to a tech career, or enhance their current tech skills. The reason for 4 and not 5 stars is that there is a strong lean on DataCamp and Udacity resources to bring about your training, with a limited use of the incredible teaching staff to provide their own teaching materials. If they are to use these resources fully, the growth for students and the company will be near limitless.",trustpilot

3557,Masterschool,2022-08-07,"I started the course in Jan 2022. It is taught in english. The data analysis learning part goes on for around 7 months. And then you start the career accelerator part where you learn about all of the tools and skills needed to apply for a job. The 7-month course is taught with 3 different tools: Udacity-hosted main course, Datacamp for practice and daily webinars for understanding thr projects on udacity and advanced topics. One can book a meeting with any of the teachers for further assistance. One is required to invest around 20 hours/week to complete and understand the topics and projects. The best thing about the udacity course is that you really need to invest the time they ask you to. That means, it is very comprehensive. The udacity course is divided in sub sections. After every section you have a project, you need to complete the project according to the guidelines. The assistance at udacity would review it and won't pass the project until the guidelines are met. That said, you learn a lot with this hit and trial method. Some constructive criticism would be that the career accelerator should not start at the end of the course, rather it should go hand in hand with the course. Because what helps to get a job at the end is if you have a student job experience. And applying for that is hard work. For that you need to understand a lot of stuff and that could be a tooic to cover with the course. If you are ready to put in thr work, the extra effort to land a job no matter what, then you will find the course really good for you. You have to pay nothing almost nothing when you start the course and do a contract to pay them back after you land a job. And they take full responsibility that you get one. That is a big factor for a student who can't pay a lot of money to learn something. And they are always ready to help. Put in the work and persistence, you will benefit. Gurinder Arora",trustpilot

Each of the students got a couple of mentors - an experienced person from the industry who answered our questions and gave valuable pieces of advice, and an HR specialist who gave the individual recommendations on how to improve your resume and LinkedIn profile, trained typical interview questions, etc. We also used unlimited access to all Datacamp courses and training for free, weekly webinars with industry professionals and well-organized students group practices.

More details about the program: + Admission: This was a success-based education program that in order to join, I first had to pass the admission step. It was a small assignment and an 1-1 interview. Only 100 candidates among ~4000 applications in Germany were chosen for the program in 2021. + 9months intensive training: important data analyst topics were introduced together with related theory and applied techniques (Python, SQL, Tableau, etc.) then practiced directly on real case projects. Simple yet effective. + Career acceleration phase: CV optimization, mock HR and technical interview on demand, weekly technical practice sessions and weekly seminars covering various soft skill topics, networking and various career days, etc. No time limit, support is constantly there until you are good on your own.

They invited career experts and senior data analysts from the industry into the webinars. Hence, we, the students, know the latest trends in the industry, best practices, what works, and whatnot. Job searching is challenging and stressful. The mentors in Masterschool helped me keep motivated by providing 1:1 coaching sessions and 24/7 support whenever we needed help.

3570,Masterschool,2022-03-10,"I was a part of the first German cohort by Masterschool, school that showed decisiveness through setting out goals for every student, participants of the program. I was willing to work very hard to keep up with intensive tempo of studying. One of the crucial things for me when deciding for Masterschool is their success based model. Students pay their tuition fee after they find a job! This helped me not to ""carry heavy burden"" but rather to focus on subject and studying. This also means Masterschool is choosing participants for the program very carefuly because our success is their success. Practicum100 includes 100 best talents and we had 9 months to finish different business projects which was an opportunity to get to know diverse industries (banking, e-commerce, telecomunication, mobility service provider, fitness industry, social media, restaurants,...). We used platform on which we had access to the studying material very well organised and presented. In 2 week sprints we were obligated to learn the theory, finish small assignments and a particular project. Projects were reviewed by Data Analyst professionals and were accepted only if we delivered true and wide enough insights with a meaningful business recommendation. If we were not able to deliver in time (being overwhelmed with our everyday jobs and family obligations) we could easily communicate this to find a solution. Saturday's Marathons were organised in that case as well; all day long interaction between mentors, instructors and students for more encouragement. We had mentors and could ask questions any time. Community managers made sure cummunication is always working smothly. I really liked weekly webinars where we would learn even more from our mentors or from data professionals from different companies. After finishing our Final Project we got our certificate but work wasn't done. We continued with another program; Career Accelerator (CA). I found Practicum100 to be excellent but this one exceeded my expectations. In this period we started to search for jobs. The amount of support we got in CA was just amazing. We were led through all important details that play significant role in the job search process; CVs, networking, portfolios, interview simulations (technical and soft skill), weekly squad meeting where we would share our lows and the highs of our job search, access to the Data Camp platform where we continued to brush our skills and learn new ones, weekly group Tecnical practice and regular webinars. They gave us every possible support anyone could have asked at any point, emotional support included, which is very important to have during this intensive program. During both programs we were regularly asked to give feedback so they can improve even more and give us even more support. I am about to start on my new job next week and will be forever grateful for amazing service and support that Masterschool gave me!",trustpilot

The course content: The courses were well-organized and oriented around the scope of the data analysis. There were weekly project deadlines for us to finish. Each project was reviewed from professionals, and sometimes there were reviews and resubmissions. The community: My 5 start rating goes to the community. Without it, I couldn't achieve my goals. A well-structured community was formed with learners from all around the world. Each community had their own ""leader"" and acted as a person to foremost hear our problems and then as instructor helped us and guided us. Also, sharing our experiences made me keep going and trying my best. This community made me stay loyal to my purpose and finally achieve my goals. Extras: The program also comes with other perks, as at the final stage you are going to have a team of specialists working on the backstage arranging meetings and prepare us for job interviews, CV writing, Job fair, etc. Conclusion: After almost 8 months, I finally got to land on my dream job.

All students are very motivated and support each other which made learning a really great experience. The mentors are very knowledgeable and respond quickly to your requests, so you’re never alone when you encounter any problems with your assignments. After the bootcamp you get intensive career support. This includes writing a CV and cover letter as well as several interview simulations with experienced recruiters from the industry.

3575,Masterschool,2022-02-15,"I completed a 9-month intensive program in Data Analytics. What I loved about it is that you can learn at your own pace (so no live lessons), but at the same time have 2-week deadlines to finish the sprints and respective projects. This is the perfect balance, as you plan your time ahead, and still have the deadline to avoid procrastinating. We were able to ask questions to other students and mentors. Mentors would usually answer within 24h, and most of the times fellow students would answer your question in minutes, which gave a great feeling of ""team work"" and a great community. The content is not basic. I would say 85% python, 10%SQL, and the remaining 5% a mix of Tableau, Git, and other skills like web scrapping. It is easier if you have a math background, but definitely not impossible if you haven´t (I didn't and made it!). At the end of the program, Masterschool provides support to help us find our first job in the tech industry. From CV coaching, to LinkedIn suggestions, 1:1 sessions to create your own pitch for interviewers, to even our own job fairs with potential employers. Besides all the technical aspects, you can tell that the Masterschool team works with their heart. Not only they know how to connect to us, but also keep asking for feedback to improve their methods and help us kickstart our career in the tech industry. Their support is beyond great!

Die Community Manager, das gesamte Team und glücklicherweise auch meine Kurspartner*innen haben mich von Anfang an unterstützt. Ich habe mich während des gesamten Kurses sehr gut aufgehoben, wertgeschätzt und betreut gefühlt. Der Kurs hält absolut, was er verspricht – ich hätte mir kein besseres Bootcamp aussuchen können. Die Inhalte sind didaktisch hervorragend aufbereitet (und das sage ich als jemand, der selbst an einer deutschen Universität gelehrt hat). Die Struktur ist so gestaltet, dass Teilnehmende mit unterschiedlichem Vorwissen dort abgeholt werden, wo sie stehen. Auch ohne vorherige Erfahrung in Data Science kann man dem Kurs sehr gut folgen – vorausgesetzt, man bringt ein gewisses technisches Verständnis und eine gute Auffassungsgabe für Daten mit. Die Lehre ist eine gelungene Mischung aus fundierter Theorie und praxisnahen, projektbezogenen Aufgaben, die direkt auf die Arbeit in Unternehmen vorbereiten. Wer sich überfordert fühlt, erhält zusätzliche Erklärangebote und wird bei technischen Herausforderungen sehr kleinschrittig und empathisch begleitet. Wer sich unterfordert fühlt, kann sich jederzeit an Bonusaufgaben versuchen. Die Instructors der WBS habe ich in über 95 % der Fälle als hervorragend organisiert und fachlich sehr kompetent erlebt. Fragen werden individuell, verständlich und mit viel Geduld beantwortet – selbst bei größeren Gruppen. Ein weiteres Plus ist die Karriereberatung, die deutlich macht, dass es sich um ein seriöses Weiterbildungsangebot handelt. Natürlich kann niemand einen Job garantieren – der Arbeitsmarkt ist momentan hart umkämpft – aber die Tipps und Tools, die man im Kurs erhält, sind praxisnah und wertvoll. Besonders hervorheben möchte ich zwei Dozierende, die mich mit ihrer didaktischen Klarheit und Geduld beeindruckt haben: Markus Hoffmann und ganz besonders Vasil Georgiev – vielen, vielen Dank für eure großartige Arbeit!

The curriculum was well-structured, focusing on Python, SQL, etc, and hands-on learning through mini-projects. The program emphasized individual and teamwork, allowing us to collaborate on real-world data challenges. The dedicated teachers were incredibly supportive, guiding us through complex topics and ensuring we grasped each concept. The highlight was the Community Day, where we connected with students across various disciplines, fostering a collaborative environment. The culmination of the course—our final project presentations—was an epic showcase of talent, creativity, and skill development. I highly recommend WBS Coding School for its comprehensive approach, outstanding support, and strong focus on practical, career-ready skills",trustpilot

The instructors are genuinely focused on feedback and are always looking for ways to improve the experience. Our main instructor was fantastic! What I loved most is that the course is project-oriented. You not only learn technical skills but also pick up valuable soft skills and teamwork experience along the way. The supporting instructors are super helpful, too. They give you the space to find solutions on your own, guiding you to discover answers rather than just handing them to you. The curriculum is well-structured and serves as a great resource that you can always refer back to. I learned a ton of Python and various tools that I definitely wouldn’t have tackled on my own. The only area I think could be more practical is A/B testing; it felt a bit too mathematical and less applicable to real-world scenarios. As for the career services, there’s room for improvement. They tend to be a bit general and often cater to multiple batches in one session, but you do get personal reviews, which is nice. Overall, it was a rewarding experience, and I feel much more prepared for my next steps!",trustpilot

3604,WBS coding school,2023-06-06,"My experience is based on English classes.Course Web development: February - June 2023 - BAD: The course is titled: Full-Stack WEB & APP development. But they don't make APPs for google play or apple store. On the page it says ""APPLY NOW"". The knowledge test is a joke, even your grandmother can pass it and just like an interview, the important thing is that you pay, then you can access. All the classes are online and they have no control over the teachers, we had the bad luck that we had a teacher who gave classes while he was travelling in America, despite our complaints the academy did not react until two months later (the course lasts three months) and put another teacher. In addition, the teacher fell asleep or turned off the camera during the weekly project presentations, was not able to solve the exercises and skipped the explanations of the syllabus on the online platform. There are no personal assessment exams. In the end all students receive a certificate from the academy whether they have done the exercises well or not at all...it's more like a certificate of attendance. You are forced to work in a team and it was rare to get it right, some didn't connect, others did everything on their own... They advertised that 92% of the students find a job associated with the technologies and I doubt it very much, in my class there were 19 of us and maybe 20% of them will get it. The person who was assigned to us for the ""CAREER SUPPORT"" part didn't know how to write English well and I didn't think her advice was very good. The course is extremely expensive for what it is...The course is not worth that at all....But they don't care because it is financed by the arbeitsamt. GOOD: They work with codecademy, you can use a premium account during the course. They use discord chat and google meet to manage the classes. You can make appointments with junior teachers for questions. The learning platform they use you can continue to use it after the end of the course. If you are lucky you can get a good teacher. They record all the explanations of topics, events... you can access them whenever you want. They repeat the explanations of the syllabus and can be accessed by anyone. My final opinion: I would not do a course at this academy again. I would not recommend this school.",trustpilot

3606,Digital career institute,2025-03-28,"My story began with a long wait for the promised equipment, such as a laptop, monitor, etc. When I finally received it, you should know that these were the cheapest monitor, mouse, keyboard, and headset you could find in any store. The training seemed to start well... the first 3 months were fine, but then the company decided to lay off many employees, which had a huge impact on the next 7 months of training. They promise that language courses will be paid for, and if you attend at least 90% of the lessons, they will cover the cost of an exam, such as TELC, Goethe, or other similar exams. Unfortunately, this never happened. They simply didn’t cover anything. In the end, they only offered an online test to assess your language skills, which is completely useless and doesn’t compare to a real exam like TELC or Goethe. Over the next 7 months, the instructors kept changing, from quite good to outright bad. Most of my learning was carried out with the help of ChatGPT and YouTube, but NOT DCI. Then came the final project, followed by the ""internship""... Don’t get your hopes up that they will find you an internship with any tech company... that's all a lie. If you don’t find it yourself, you’ll be stuck with their completely useless career support, where a well-meaning lady will read slide information to you. (By the way, the information is trivial and superficial, taken not from real experience but from random YouTube video titles about job searching, like: Don't wear slippers to an interview Prepare your LinkedIn profile Make your CV look nice Learn new skills They'll read this out for half an hour once a week... It’s absolutely terrible. In the end, you’ll be asked to return the equipment (which is not real equipment at all), and you’ll be removed from all communication channels with the management. Even if you still have questions, don’t expect any answers. Summary: Disorganization and lack of communication with management Changing terms without notice Inadequate career support Broken promises They promise to find you an internship and even offer a job through their ""partner tech companies"", but that’s all a lie — no one will offer you either an internship or a job. They promise, but they won't deliver. Stay away and don’t waste your time! This course costs an unjustifiable amount.",trustpilot

3608,Digital career institute,2025-02-12,"Before I continue with some of the things I think could use improving, I just want to say a big thank you to the teachers in my course, they really put an effort into teaching, and have proved nice people and trying always to do the best they could to help everybody who had asked for help with very big patience and offering different possibilities of solutions. The lectures were concise most of the times, and if they weren't, there was a considerable amount of good will on the teachers side to help clear the misunderstanding or unclear parts. Also, having been surrounded by nice people and colleagues who were willing to help with code issues (here I especially mean two tutors and a few other colleagues) were strongest reasons for DCI earning that one star from me. I couldn't complain to my communication with the class management, although I know that some other colleagues weren't satisified at all when at times it seemed even the class managers could only shrug their shoulders after listening to our complaints because their hands seemed tied to address some of the issues (let's mention only not being able to record the lessons for later, which would have been a great help in learning). Now, I will follow with a few complaints in order to justify why I wouldn't give more than one star and give some suggestions. On a general level, there seems to be a big discrepancy between how things about the courses are presented when advertising the course, and how they turn out when actually coming to the realization stage. The Orientation Course, at least the one being held in 2023. by my humble opinion didn't at all offer a fair representation of all the longer courses it should help attendees orientate towards. Namely, Python, Java, AWS, Salesforce were fit each in half a day or a day in the best case, which definitely couldn't be enough for someone to decide whether they would take any of these courses, at least not based on the experiences gained about these courses in the Orientation Course. For instance, I was initially interested more in learning Python than Web Development, but as Python was underrepresented, I didn't dare to choose Python based on a one day experience. As I did subsequently choose a one year Web Dev course, I could say that from today's perspective, had I encountered the JavaScript in the Orientation Course phase, I probably wouldn't have decided for Web Dev. As simple as that. My suggestion would be to please significantly improve the structure of the orientation course to include more relevant information on all the courses offered. Also bear in mind that the Orientation Course should be more discriminative for attendees that might not be successful in the one year course. The goal of Orientation Course, along giving fair information about one year courses would also be to reduce the content related drop out rate in the one year courses, after the Bildungsgutschein by ArbeitsAmt has already been issued. Continuing, I don't know about other courses, but my general complaint to DCI advertisement strategies is they should be leveled down to bear the reality check. If the situation on the market is tough, the advertising of the courses should be fit accordingly. Namely, I suggest to put an up to date 1. feedback about different courses completion/dropout rates as well as 2. placement statistics separately for each course, especially after the finish of alumni period. 3. Also mention how many graduates have managed to land an internship, land a job after an internship, land an internship in the DCI partner companies, and most importantly land a job after internships in DCI partner companies, as a certain control indicator of whether the courses are adequately tailored to the DCI partners needs or not. The materials that we've learned in the one year Web Dev course are a good basis for further learning, but unfortunately not more than that. Therefore most of the colleagues in my course generation didn't stand a real chance even for the internship. Hence, I would strongly suggest to please take down the 80% placement rate slogan, and rather update it monthly with relevant data across all the courses DCI offers, as mentioned above. My final and most important suggestion would be to work and arrange with your partners companies to assure a 100% internship for all the alumni that finish any of the DCI longer courses, and help support covering the adequate part of all the future students Bildungsgutscheins costs based on every successful candidate that any partner company decides to keep after successfully finishing the internship phase. This would be the real proof of DCI programs tailored to their partners needs and a DCI that I'd consider giving more than only 1 star. Sincerely and constructively, Tomislav Miljak",trustpilot

3611,Digital career institute,2024-12-12,"My opinion on the online marketing… My opinion on the online marketing course from DCI: If you are looking for helpful advice, don’t waste your time on DCI. Let’s look at some negative points: Most teachers don’t know the subject deeply enough, so they only teach the basics, which won’t help you get a job (don’t believe everything marketers say). You are put into small groups on Google Meet, given a 1.5-hour task, and the teachers leave to enjoy their coffee. The tasks are unclear, even native speakers don’t understand their purpose. At the end of the course, you get a certificate that has no real value compared to an Umschulung or Ausbildung. 99% of their clients are foreigners, most of whom recently arrived in Germany. A B1-level certificate is clearly not enough. The course costs about €30,000, but honestly, it shouldn’t be more than €4,000 (maybe there’s something about the price we don’t know). The course lasts 12 months, but such courses should take no more than 3 months. One positive thing: The people are very friendly (80%), though some are too young and don’t know how to handle students. My advice: Try something with an IHK certificate or an Umschulung.

3655,neuefische,2024-03-06,"Also, zunächst war ich doch recht skeptisch und hatte Zweifel, dass ich nach dem Bootcamp ein Unternehmen finden werde, das offen sein wird für Absolventen, die NUR ein Bootcamp gemacht haben und vorher nichts mit der IT zu tun hatten, ABER ich wurde eines Besseren belehrt. Als Ex-Recruiter wusste ich bereits, wie die Mehrheit der Unternehmen in Deutschland denkt bezüglich klassischer Ausbildung und Quereinstieg. Trotz des Fachkräftemangels des Grauens, der ab 2035 ja noch mehr Tempo aufnehmen wird, dachte ich, es wird sehr schwer werden, einen Einstieg zu finden. Ich bin auch davon ausgegangen, dass die Anforderungen an uns Quereinsteiger so hoch sein werden wie bei jemandem, der von der Uni oder von der Ausbildung kommt. Das mag in vielen Unternehmen nach wie vor der IST-Zustand sein, aber es gibt auch aktuell wenige Unternehmen, die Quereinsteigern Chancen geben. Es braucht einfach viel Geduld, und man muss gut sein in den Coding Challenges, die zum Großteil darüber entscheiden werden, ob man den Job bekommt oder nicht. Projekte vorweisen, ja, das ist schön und gut, in meinem Fall habe ich ein Blatt Papier bekommen und einen Stift und durfte die FizzBuzz-Aufgabe lösen... in 10 Minuten. Ich rate jedem, der kann, eine Ausbildung zum Fachinformatiker zu machen, eine Umschulung oder das Studium und ein Bootcamp nur dann zu wählen, wenn es anders nicht geht oder man bereit ist, das Risiko einzugehen, dass man erstmal keinen Job bekommt. Ich habe 30 Bewerbungen versendet, und ich hatte nur 1 Gespräch, bei dem es glücklicherweise direkt geklappt hat. Ich bin jedoch positiv gestimmt, dass Bootcamps und der Quereinstieg immer mehr ein Thema werden. Es gibt auch viele Unternehmen, die bereits intern Quereinsteiger ausbilden und sozusagen ein internes Bootcamp mit den Quereinsteigern durchlaufen. Dies sind erst anfängliche Entwicklungen, die bestimmt rasant Fahrtwind aufnehmen werden. Wenn Du jetzt immernoch das Bootcamp machen möchtest, dann kann ich die neuefische nur empfehlen, Top Leute dort!",trustpilot
3656,neuefische,2023-09-26,"The education you receive is not worth the price tag. Many of the lecturers Data Science knowledge is only from doing the bootcamp themselves prior to being your teacher. There's only 2 months of lectures before you are left on your own to complete your capstone. The marketing theu use to sell the bootcamp is not true. There is not a high employment rate after the bootcamp. The education is not enough to become a Data Science. There are no partner companies giving you projects or data for your capstone. But you won't be told this surprise until the last minute. The partner companies very rarely employ anyone from the bootcamp, if ever. The Career support they promise is a lie. They have no interest in helping you get a job, though they may show a slight interest if you identify as female. Its seems like their promotion of gender equality is more like reverse descrimination. Most people do the course free through Bildungsgutschein and they are then offered €500 to entice their friends to apply for it. There friends are then also given €500 of vouchers for joining. This is ethically questionable given the funds are coming from public funds, and in my opinion shows the poor educational value of the course. You receive a certificate of attendance just for showing up, regardless of your capabilities. Again, this has zero value since there are no test metrics to prove your ability. Many Data Science jobs on linked in have 500 applicants, Junior positions often have over 1000. The market is flooded with people who do these courses and their only hope of employment is as Data Science bootcamp lecturers, growing the pyramid scheme.",trustpilot
3657,neuefische,2023-05-23,"Zusammenfassung: Trotz einiger positiver Aspekte war ich insgesamt enttäuscht von diesem Kurs, vor allem wegen des schlechten Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnisses, fehlender Struktur und zurückgehaltener Informationen. Hier sind die Details meiner Erfahrung: Ich hatte mich ganz bewusst für einen Kurs eingeschrieben, der mir von einem ehemaligen Arbeitskollegen empfohlen wurde. Generell war das Feedback von Leuten, die denselben Kurs belegt hatten, sehr positiv. Leider lief bei unserem Kurs einiges schief. Der Coach, der für die vorherigen Kurse verantwortlich war, verließ das Unternehmen zu Beginn des Kurses, was dazu führte, dass wir in den ersten zwei Wochen einen wirklich schlechten Unterricht hatten. Zum Glück wurde dann eine Notbremse gezogen und ein neuer Coach eingestellt. Dieser leitete den Kurs zusammen mit einem angehenden Coach. Obwohl der Unterricht sich verbesserte, war keine klare Linie zu erkennen. Auf viele Fragen gab es keine klaren Antworten oder wir wurden vertröstet. Das abschließende Capstone-Projekt war eher eine Farce. Angekündigte Code-Reviews wurden nicht durchgeführt, Fragen wurden falsch beantwortet und allgemein hatte man oft das Gefühl, auf sich allein gestellt zu sein. Als dann das von Anfang an angekündigte Abschlussevent mit den Firmen ausfiel, war bei den meisten Mitschülern das Verständnis am Ende. Viele waren so frustriert, dass sie nicht einmal mehr ein Feedbackgespräch führen wollten. Ich gehörte zu denen, die trotzdem ein solches Gespräch gesucht haben. Der Kurs kostete über 12.000 €, und für diesen Preis war die Leistung wirklich schwach. Ich hätte den gleichen Inhalt auch in drei Monaten auf Udemy lernen können, der versprochene Mehrwert durch das Capstone-Projekt, die Zusammenarbeit über Github und die versprochene Unterstützung bei der Jobsuche mit Firmen fiel komplett weg. Mir wurde in meinem Feedbackgespräch versprochen, dass eine mögliche Kompensation geprüft würde. Seitdem (das ist jetzt über zwei Monate her) habe ich jedoch nichts mehr gehört.",trustpilot

Man wolle testen wie gut mein Englisch ist. (Ist leider nicht sehr flüssig). Die Dame sehr ungeduldig und ungehalten, man merkte Sie hat keine Lust. Die Fragen wie „Haben Sie schon Gruppenarbeiten gemacht? Was hatten Sie zuletzt gemacht?“ wurden gefragt. Ich bin knapp 40. Nach dem Gespräch, erstmal eine Woche stille. Auf meine Email und der Frage nach einem Angebot, bekam ich eine plumpe Absage. Ich vermute mein Englisch war nicht gut genug für den Kurs. Ich verstehe halt nicht wie das Unternehmen Geld verdienen möchte, wenn nicht mehr Zeit für die Menschen investiert wird. Ich persönlich hätte mit englisch kein Problem, verstehe viel. Vielleicht ist sie Absage auch gut gewesen, da die Absolventen bei Bewertungsgesprächen ohne tiefe schwimmen und wenig Chancen auf dem Markt haben.",trustpilot

3661,Spiced academy,2021-07-24,"The bootcamp is basically a very fast-paced no-frills topic review to check all the boxes as quickly as possible. For people who have studied computer science or something similar before it might be OK, but for someone who truly wants to learn and change careers it's a complete waste of time and money. You can actually end up more confused and worse off than before you started (that was my case and I wasn't even completely new to the topics). You will get the same or even a better experience googling all the topics and using all the free online resources. Since the pandemic they decided to expand and grow and start as many students and cohorts as fast as possible. Most assistants are nice but almost never available when you need them. Each class is with a randomly selected assistant so there's never a good transition between topics. They say it's 700 hours in 3 months but you are lucky if you even get 4 hours per day. No one pays for the bootcamp, the German government pays, which is also why most people don't care if they truly learned something or not. A real money making machine for them.",trustpilot

The teachers Omar and Aykut and teaching material in the Student Portal is very understanding and of good quality.

Joyce, our Program manager together with the rest of the team plan beautiful events (the welcome event was so on point, and this week we gonna have a little Halloween Party 😍). Also the Ironhack Show at the end of the bootcamp where the cohorts Web Development, Data Analysis and UX/UI present their projects should be amazing, and I am very looking forward to it already today 😁 in general I really love the fact, that the three bootcamps of web development, ux/ui and data analysis, take place at the same time. This way you can connect to many different people that are at the same point in life as you yourself: a career switch.

3692,Ironhack,2024-06-19,"Data Analytics Campus - August 2023 The campus is located on the ring (Landsberger Allee) and can be reached in 5 minutes on foot. A) Intro First there is an interview to understand the intentions and goals together. If this meets the requirements, you will be invited to a technical test afterwards. 1 hour is given to complete 20-30 questions online. Once this part has been passed, the journey begins. However, before the course can officially begin, each participant must complete the “prework”. This is first the setup for the computer and then the introduction to Python, SQL, statistics and Excel. Don't underestimate it, it's a lot of effort. However, this prepares you mentally for the official boot camp. A workload of 60 hours was given, I needed a lot more. It can vary depending on the type of learner. Overall I was satisfied. The portal where the exams for prework are queried is not my biggest friend. Partly because it's just not that user friendly for me and the tasks have been made much more difficult than in the preparation. B) Boot camp The course lasts 9 weeks and is followed by 3 more weeks of career coaching. From the first day you have to go full throttle. This means no breather at the beginning. The first week began on the first day with small programming tasks, which increased in difficulty on the following days. This automatically challenges your knowledge and problem-oriented thinking and repeats the material you learned from the previous days. So that at the end of the first week we had already written an entire code to escape from an escape room consisting of several rooms. And that in the first week. Of course, this quickly leads to frustration and helplessness, but it also brings the group together. This is all normal and part of the concept. And that was only the first week and so it continues at this pace and in depth. It covers Python, SQL, Tableau and Machine Learning. In addition, an exercise (lab) must be submitted every day in addition to a knowledge quiz at the end of the week. We had a great teacher who approached each of us with his emphatic manner, alongside his patience, understanding and the didactic principle of learning by example. You will learn an enormous amount in this short, manageable time. Looking back, I can't believe how quickly and how much mentally stronger I've grown. Always remember, the journey is the goal and with every step you get closer to it. C) At all times I had the feeling that I was in good hands. If there were problems, work was done to find a solution. Joyce (Program Manager) is your first point of contact. She and her team were always warm and accommodating. They also try to make everyone feel comfortable. How is this implemented, you ask? At the end of each week there will be a survey asking you to respond. The evaluation is evaluated and implemented in the best possible way. So Joyce was always very behind in case any of us had forgotten. There were also a lot of events organized over the 9 weeks to network and have some fun. Such a tiny bit of fun... My personal experience was great and I can only recommend it if you want to reposition yourself in this area.",google
3693,Ironhack,2024-07-04,"My experience with the full-time UX/UI bootcamp, costing around €8500 and ending in May 2023, had some noteworthy aspects: - Increased class size from 20 to 30 made presentations and Q&A sessions challenging. - The curriculum heavily relied on PowerPoint presentations, lacking interactivity. - The learning environment felt less professional than expected. - Strict guidelines seemed more appropriate for high school students than professionals. - Career preparation and guidance were insufficient, and interactions with industry experts were lacking. - Constructive feedback was inconsistent, and the cost-benefit ratio, considering the abundance of online resources, raised questions about the program's overall value. On the other hand, the Career Week proved to be a highly engaging and beneficial experience, featuring exceptional instructors and serving as a valuable asset in enhancing one's portfolio development.",google

Any questions or concerns I had were promptly addressed by Dirk, which made me feel valued as an aspiring student. One of the standout aspects of my experience with Ironhack was the personalized support and guidance throughout the admission process.

3697,Ironhack,2024-08-27,"""I'm writing this for those who are unsure about whether to participate in this bootcamp or not. Just like you, I was in your shoes two to five months ago. I had doubts about whether Ironhack or any other bootcamp would be a good choice. However, after completing the bootcamp, I have to say that if you want to take part in this program, you have to rely on yourself. Don't rely solely on the teachers or staff. No one is going to do the work for you. I completed all my projects on my own, working alone. It's not that the teacher wasn't available; they were, but they couldn't dedicate equal time to everyone. I was lucky to be able to manage everything on my own, but you might not have the same experience. So, be careful. However, taking part in this bootcamp isn't a bad idea. You learn how to set up and push your limits, whether you receive support from the teacher or not. In this boot camp, I learned that I could learn everything on my own without a bootcamp. Putting yourself in a competitive environment is also beneficial. So, think again and, if you want, give it a shot. once again ***DONT rely on anyone if you wanna join the bootCamp rely on Yourself only",google

I had no experience in the field other than working alone and this experience has given me an idea of how things work in real life. I can say that the enrolment process is very fast and impressively easy, I have also been given advice and guidance with the bureaucratic issues of the employment agency here in Germany.

3705,Ironhack,2024-10-09,"I was participating in the Ironhack UX/UI Design Bootcamp in Berlin from August to October 2023 and I can really recommend this training to everyone considering a career shift towards UX/UI design. It is very hands on, and I gained a lot of theoretical and practical knowledge in these 9 weeks. On a typical day we had lectures in the morning and project work in the afternoon. At the beginning, the projects were fictitious but towards the end we worked with real customers on their topics. From day 1, the design thinking method was used, and I can state that after running 5 projects with design thinking, I really see the value of this approach and feel proficient in using that method. My course (or cohort in Ironhack jargon) was pretty large and had slightly more than 30 students. It was a bit tight in the classroom but still manageable. Ironhack handled the educational challenge very well by assigning a lead teacher and two teaching assistants to our course which worked out to be very efficient. All three teachers were confident, skilled, highly motivated and always available to guide and help. We had really good mood from day 1 in the classroom and we grew together over time and I can state that true friendships developed in these 9 short and intense weeks. I also liked that Ironhack was organizing a weekly socializing event/party which could range from “beers in the park” over a joint breakfast or dinner to a karaoke night. I would like to thank the teaching team Max, Suzanne and Alicia for all their great teaching efforts, help and support.

The labs, lesson materials, and projects were great (though this is global Ironhack stuff, and not specifically to do with the Berlin location). But I was disappointed with the organisation as it was poor, with many unfulfilled promises. For example, the classes were supposed to have 20 students, but there were actually 30. There were no monitors. We had only one spontaneous interaction with an alumnus, but never with recruiters or anyone outside of Ironhack, despite their promises of external talks and success stories. Additionally, we never received keys to the campus, making it difficult to enter. Career support was lacking, with mostly ""just keep going"" type of advice. When I tried to book a 1-on-1 session with my online career coach, who is the only one for all of Berlin, I found that there were ""no openings at the moment,"" and this has been the case for two months. Lectures were not at all interactive and furthermore, the programming teachers (who were super nice) didn't have much experience with programming; they were mostly Ironhack graduates who were only able to teach what they had learned at Ironhack themselves. To make matters worse, our (or at least my) code was never reviewed, and we received no feedback on anything, including our final project. Based on my experience, I'm not sure if I would recommend Ironhack as I feel like I learned a lot, but I also had to put in a lot of effort and work on my own to do so.

Pay attention to these scribbles, do you understand any of them? What about few months later, when you have already forgotten everything and you have a specific case for example you ask yourself how do I know what test should I use to test my hypothesis? Clearly we can see or more precisely we can't see structure in these scribbles! On the other hand, on the right we see teaching materials from another much cheaper course, which clearly and in a structured way helps us to ask the right questions such as how many populations I have, do I know population variance, and so on. and accordingly to choose the right test to test our hypotheses. Don't be fooled that they will help you find jobs, they didn't even check our CV, but left us to check it ourselves in ResumeWorded.

Tech-related work always interested me and I tried to pick up bits and pieces about coding, but never really had the perseverance and wholistic knowledge resources to really get started in tech. Building a website requires knowledge about so many programming languages, frameworks, and concepts that I was never really able to bring all the pieces together. A friend of me told me about Le Wagon and the learning style seemed to be perfect for me. Le Wagon has an intranet with resources that help during and after the bootcamp. The bootcamp is built around this intranet and I learned how to solve technical issues with and without help from instructors. After the bootcamp, I was able to build complete websites with all sorts of functionality, design features, and user interactivity. As I started a data science degree program after the bootcamp, I benefited from the software development skills that the bootcamp provides to students. Now, I am not only confident in web development, but I can also transfer these skills to other software development-related fields. Our ""batch"" (that is the bunch of people that did the bootcamp with me at the same time in Berlin) was international to more than 50% and we spoke English 99% of the time. Everyone had a different background and almost everyone had a big career change coming up.

3801,le wagon,2019-06-19,"As a philosophy student, I had a few creative ideas that I hope to develop, but was unable to due to my lack of technical skills. In 9 weeks, Le Wagon gave us an insight into what it's like to materialize an idea. The bootcamp is divided into two stages - the first stage consists of learning the basics of Ruby, Javascript, CSS, SQL, and other tools, and the second stage consists of applying what we’ve learned to practice (i.e. develop websites using what’ve learned!). As an aspiring product manager/entrepreneur, the second stage was especially helpful since we learned how to pitch ideas, measure the feasibility of developing an idea in a limited amount of time, create user-journeys, design prototypes for website, and work as and with developers to create websites. We were constantly supported by hardworking and patient teaching assistants and other students despite all the mental struggles! Also, I came to the bootcamp with a biased pre-conception that developers are antisocial; this presumption was totally reversed by the end of the first day! Everyone was very open-minded and social. Le Wagon also makes sure that we get the chance to know everyone in the bootcamp - each day, we are paired up with a new buddy with whom we cooperate to solve daily coding challenges. Personally, I consider this the best part of the bootcamp because I was not only able to cooperate with people from diverse backgrounds, but was also able to see how each person think differently by taking different approaches to solve a problem! Le Wagon also organized quite a few career talks with product managers, entrepreneurs, and developers - I was able to gain perspectives on what I might be interested in doing after my studies by learning about work experiences of invited speakers, classmates, and alumni.

The dashboard design breaks the material into small, manageable sections, helping me stay motivated without feeling overwhelmed. The hands-on projects are a great way to apply what you’re learning, and if you put yourself out there, you can build a student community for extra support. That said, one area where I think CareerFoundry could improve is in offering more personal interaction with tutors. While weekly video calls with mentors are helpful, tutors—who are more directly involved with your assignments—are only reachable via written feedback or chat messages. Having occasional video or phone calls with tutors could really enhance the learning experience and clarify feedback more effectively.

Despite applying to hundreds of roles and participating in their 6-month job guarantee, I have not secured employment nor even a single interview. Following the course, I sought advice from an experienced designer who reviewed my portfolio (which was initially approved by CareerFoundry mentors) and found it far below industry standards. When I requested a refund per the job guarantee, it was denied due to “insufficient documentation” and missed biweekly mentor meetings. Meeting this requirement was virtually impossible due to my full-time job, mentor cancellations, and delayed responses. Regarding the “missing” documentation, the requirements for tracking job applications were vague and unclear. While they mentioned needing screenshots of networking contacts and job applications, it wasn’t specified that these were absolute requirements. If this documentation was essential, it would have been helpful if they had stated that explicitly. Additionally, key design topics like accessibility and typography were only briefly covered, so I had to rely heavily on external resources. Unfortunately CareerFoundry declined my request for a phone discussion, citing staffing limitations, which seemed surprising given their UX focus.

3877,Careerfoundry,2024-10-09,"CareerFoundry review I learned a lot. Great. But getting a job? No. I did everything possible to make myself look worthy of an entry-level job, even had to adjust my schedule just to talk to one of my mentors as required, because she literally never had time to talk… funny how it’s her job she was never available for, but anyways, if you think that you can land a job without an actual college degree, think again. The world of UX is now so oversaturated with the masses of competition that you might as well be lost in a sea of fish spending hours looking for every job posting that becomes available. And, even if you do have a lot of experience and a certification, the person with a degree gets picked anyways. So, like me, you spend your money on attempts to avoid college, just to turn around and go back to college because a certification from CareerFoundry got you nowhere except a good baseline of how to do UX/UI work. It’s not completely their fault, but it’s the way the world works. If this does work for you, you either got lucky or know the right people. If you want to be a designer, just do college. At least then you’ll have a degree to compete against and won’t be left with over 150 denial emails about how you don’t have a degree or don’t meet the requirements. The worst part of this all is that they have decided I don’t meet the requirements for a refund. Though, several of the reasons were because I didn’t have all the scheduled calls with my mentor even though she hardly ever had time available to meet, and the other reason being I didn’t have another project completed on my portfolio or land any interviews… which I can’t really control if I don’t get any job opportunities. So I am not happy with the outcome. I at least would be leaving a better review if my hard work and time in this course was being refunded.",google

I took a course for UX/UI design I had an awesome tutor but the mentor was not great no feedback took my work and made it what she thought it should be. I passed the course and got more info than what I was getting on my own that was the only positive thing from my year-long ordeal I was trying to get a refund as I still do not have a job after 150+ Job applications and I found out today they never stated I needed screenshots of everything on the tracking sheet they provided so I will not be getting a refund I have no job as I had to quite the one I held in the middle of my course to complete the course. I had to pay 500 out of pocket for an extension and now I owe 10,000.00 due to interest and loan cost the kicker I have no job and have gotten no offer/Interview. I also noted that when applying for jobs, you can add a boot camp or certificates; they are not listed as a company but Google is. Career Foundry focuses on networking they rely on others to help you find a job that is the default they go to so if you are looking for a place to get a new career or boost your current one look at a university or check out Google bootcamp it has to be better than this one at least it is known in the US.",google

3932,Careerfoundry,2024-06-01,"Review of CareerFoundry UX Design Bootcamp I am currently enrolled in the UX Design Bootcamp at Career Foundry, and I must say it has been an enriching experience so far. Here's my detailed review: Pros: 1. Personalized Mentorship: The highlight of Career Foundry is the personalized mentorship. Having a dedicated mentor to discuss industry insights, career advice, soft skills, and receive feedback on my work has been invaluable. The 1-on-1 calls are 60 minutes long, and I appreciate how my mentor assesses my ""achievements"" (end of chapter tasks) within 48 hours, providing timely and constructive feedback. 2. Thorough Task Assessment: Another aspect I admire is the prompt and thorough assessment of tasks by the tutor. Within 24 hours, I receive detailed feedback on my assignments (tasks), which helps me understand my strengths and areas for improvement. 3. Structured Learning: The course material is excellently structured, leaving no room for the dreaded ""I don't know what I don't know"" feeling. The timeline provided allows me to track my progress and stay on top of the tasks I need to complete. 4. Engaging Community: The Slack channel is a fantastic resource. It offers various channels like study buddy, UX jokes, and general discussions. Here, I can connect with fellow students, tutors, and mentors for research help, feedback, motivation, and more. 5. Specialization and Job Preparation: The bootcamp offers a specialization course, which is a great way to dive deeper into a specific area of UX design. I'm also looking forward to the job preparation course, which I've heard great things about. It's reassuring to know that Career Foundry is committed to preparing students for the industry. 6. Job Guarantee and Support: The job guarantee provided by Career Foundry gives me confidence in the program. Knowing that they stand behind their curriculum and support students even after completion is reassuring. Cons: 1. Redundancy for Design Backgrounds: If you have a background in design, some courses might feel redundant. Coming from industrial design in aerospace engineering, I found a few topics repetitive. 2. Tasks for Beginners: Some tasks are geared towards absolute beginners, which can be less engaging for more advanced students. This is understandable since the bootcamp caters to a wide range of skill levels. 3. Limited Project Choices: The projects available for inclusion in the portfolio are limited to a few subjects. It would be beneficial to have more diverse project options to showcase different skills and interests. 4. Software Learning: Beware that you have to learn how to work in a design software mostly by yourself - before or during the bootcamp. While you can learn software like Figma during the program, it might be overwhelming for beginners. I personally learned Figma before joining, which made the bootcamp smoother. In conclusion, Career Foundry's UX Design Bootcamp offers excellent mentorship, structured learning, and a supportive community. While there are some drawbacks, such as redundancy for design backgrounds and limited project choices, the overall experience has been amazing. I look forward to completing the program and transitioning into a career in UX design with the skills and knowledge gained from Career Foundry. Highly recommended for anyone looking to enter the UX design field!",google
3933,Careerfoundry,2024-05-01,"The mentorship aspect of the bootcamp has truly stood out to me. Having a mentor who is not only knowledgeable but also genuinely invested in my growth has been a game-changer.

Unlike in a university course, where I never knew if I’m doing enough and fast enough, CareerFoundry does a really good job in tracking your work and time in the course, so you always know how you’re doing, if you’re doing enough and in time. This really helps me stay accountable without being stressed! Another big plus is having a personal tutor and mentor, so you never feel alone (especially important for me, as studying remotely can feel lonely sometimes). Only thing I’d love to see improve is to get more detailed constructive feedback to the submissions, to satisfy curious students like me even more (Not just getting the tasks done but learning as much as possible to gain more confidence in those skills we’re building).

3946,Careerfoundry,2023-12-22,"I regret that I took the Career Foundry course. I was hoping this course would help me change careers but unfortunately I wasn’t even able to get a single interview afterwards. There are not a lot of positions and all required experience with other technology I never learned. I also discovered I prefer using excel to coding but despite my coach having had luck finding a job like that, I never did. Part of it may have been the mass of tech layoffs around the time as some positions said that over a thousand people had applied to the same job as me. I also don’t live near a city and did not want to put my private contact information on a website (between data scraping and abusive people in my life I personally don’t think it’s wise) which are both mandatory if you want a refund. My partner now continues to hold this expense over me as a mistake I made and now I am worse off financially for having tried to learn something new and improve my circumstances. I was desperate so I had hoped this would help but it didn’t. I would advise others to research the potential jobs you’re interested in thoroughly before signing up to see if this will help you qualify to apply, see if there are significant opportunities, and see if they are a good fit or not. Yes, I learned something new but I also found at times I was not able to have enough support when challenged and it was not worth it for the purpose of changing careers. I had one friend who did a bootcamp and had the same experience. I thought I would be different since I had a little experience on my own but I was not.",google

There are some gotchas like some features of the app is not in mobile version and some details not completely covered (e.g. conversion rate term was used in mobile first design lesson but not covered before) but as a whole everything arranged properly together,google
3949,Careerfoundry,2023-10-12,"Written in January 2024 Synopsis: only specific students can excel, potential money pit, out of date information I am currently working to complete the UX Design Program, and I have just about completed the UX Immersion course. Though I am not yet finished with the program, I would like to speak about my experience to give prospective students a heads-up prior to choosing CareerFoundry as their school of choice. 1. Self-Paced Program: If you are a self-motivated individual who can stay on task and stick to a schedule, you will probably be very successful with CareerFoundry. If, however, you struggle to set deadlines or stay true to the deadlines you have set, I would suggest finding an in-person bootcamp or program that has deadlines. I fall into the latter camp but fooled myself into thinking I could stay consistent which was a mistake. As a consequence, I have had to purchase a few extensions in order to finish the program. 2. Job Guarantee: CareerFoundry promises that if you are unable to find a job within 6 months of finishing a program that they will refund you your tuition. However, if you have to purchase any extensions to finish your program, it voids this guarantee, which they don't really tell you upfront. 3. TON of Reading: If you don't love to read or are a visual learner, this program may not be for you. The program is very text heavy and does not show many step-by-step tutorials. 4. Out-of-Date Material: A good majority of articles linked within lessons are out of date by several years. For a tech based program, I am surprised that these are not updated on a more regular basis. For example, they have the old version of Material Design linked in several lessons. Also, some of the linked articles on Medium have since been turned to premium articles that can only be accessed with a paid Medium membership. Overall, I often Google questions instead of reading the provided articles. 5. Tutors and Mentors: I have appreciated the help that my tutor and mentor have given me, but they often cannot provide immediate help. My tutor, Tasha, has given me good feedback on assignments, but I often feel like her responses are copy and pasted. And, I have had two mentors (first Alex then Steve) who have both given me good feedback on portfolio reviews but are only available through scheduled mentor calls. Overall, I often feel like I have a better chance of finding my answer on Google or YouTube than asking my tutor or mentor. 6. Design Software: Though you need to use design software to complete assignments, you are not given much direction as to which design software to use or how to use it. I ended up choosing Figma, and I purchased a Udemy course to figure out how to use it. I did try to learn Figma through their YouTube channel, but I found that it was not very comprehensive and it often assumed you already knew how to do certain things within Figma. 7. Community: Aside from the Slack community, there is no interaction with your peers. Considering that most design work is done collaboratively, it would be nice if this was worked into the curriculum to give students practice working in a team prior to entering the job field. 8. Tax Benefits: For students in the United States, be aware that you will not be able to claim an education credit on your taxes for tuition spending since CareerFoundry is based in Germany. Not a huge consideration, but I feel it is worth noting. Looking back, I wish that I would have spent more time looking at programs and finding one that worked better with my learning style. I ultimately chose CareerFoundry because of the price, job guarantee, and self-paced nature allowing me to work around my busy schedule; however, if I had to do it over, I would probably go with a more expensive, hands-on program or even look into Bachelor's degree programs in Interaction Design (as it seems to give you a leg up in finding jobs and gives you more experience working in teams). In the end, I have spent more money, time, and effort than I had planned and am writing this review as a cautionary tale.",google

The Tutors are meant for day to day questions, and you can have as frequent as once a week meetings with your Mentor. CareerFoundry gets you by making the crash course super easy, and the first few lessons (after you've paid) start out easy to understand and gradually get way more complicated by the 5th lesson which is after their 14 day refund window. When I asked the Tutor for any help I needed, they would just end up repeating the homework instructions and took hours to respond. The Mentor was the only one who actually helped me when I had questions but because I could only meet with them and hour a week I could only really get though one assignment a week. I even paid for two ""extensions"" to give myself more time with the Tutors and Mentor. Eventually with all the time waiting for responses and time spent banging my head against a wall, I tried to talk to the advisors and they refused a refund except for the two extensions, even though I didn't even have access to the more expansive portion of the course.

My tutor actually accepted submissions that had coding errors; I had to go back to previous lessons and redo code that he should have brought to my attention when I submitted it. My student advisors gave the most generic answers, basically it was faster to research answers myself. Do not waste your time and money on this company.

3961,Careerfoundry,2023-09-11,"I have taken the web-development course over 8 months and I don´t recommend it at all! The structure of the course is not well done and the content is too fast-paced! You are supposed to learn JavaScript within a few pages of text for example. Mostly you just learn through text! Texts and videos are partly outdated and do contain mistakes. Within the course you get to see few tutorial videos but from many different tutors which clearly shows that there is no consistency in this course. The tutors and mentors are nice and kind persons, however they just do the necessary things for you to pass the tasks, I guess they don´t have much time. The tutor (which are being contact online via messages) surely work with copy/paste contents and links whenever they reply to you in a general way. I formed a WhatsApp group with around 10 alumnis that took the same course during the same period of time. Needless to say, that none of us have managed to find employment in that field. Companies mostly need people with a solid foundation and experience which is not given by CareerFoundry. The course content might be worth 200 USD + administration fee and tutoring/mentoring. I would not say it is worth more than 1500 USD. Over time they have also changed the course description, now it states that in “part-time” you need at least 20 hours per week, as I took the course I believe it were 15 hours. At some point of the course, one of the tasks is so difficult to understand and the content so badly taught, that the video tutor literally scrolls down slowly through the whole code for your to just write it down. They also have a PDF file for you to download with the code to paste into yours, that happened few times, to me it felt like “just copy that code into yours and don´t bother more as long as you pass”. So, what often happens to many students, is that you succeed with the course without really knowing what you do and without having an in-depth foundation into any of the taught programming languages! If I had known, I would have either taken an offline course, or a much cheaper course like from codecademy which are excellent and very well explained! If you really want to learn to code, book a good course or yearly subscription with Codecademy for e.g. learn the basics, practice, meet other people online or offline and build your portfolio. But to do all this you surely don´t need CareerFoundry! You just need 1 subscription (codecademy), the willingness and motivation to learn and practice, practice, practice!

Although it can be challenging to study online (in isolation compared to on-site classrooms) the CF team stays in touch, and provides digital tools and newsletters to students to stay motivated.

Yeah, the counselors pretty much ignored everything I said and it felt like a somewhat automated/written response, if that makes sense.

There are much better programs out there that are more up to date on their materials and are less expensive. It seems like the only program of theirs that they care about maintaining and supporting is the UX program, but the coding program was unacceptable. Tutors that are either unavailable, don't care, or don't know how to explain coding, projects that are so out of date that all of them have broken within a few months of completing the program, and a program that makes you jump through absolutely ridiculous hoops to try to get a refund, which it doesn't seem like ever happens. This program was advertised to be able to complete in 8 months part-time, which is IMPOSSIBLE unless you have a very very low workload or job that doesn't require a lot from you. They also advertised that they have great tutors and mentors who support you throughout the program....I had 5 different tutors and 3 mentors due to the absolute lack of support from previous ones, and some of them being rude and insulting when you ask for help. This program talks the talk with how supportive and amazing it is, but absolutely does not walk the walk. And the fact that their projects are YEARS out of date is absolutely ridiculous. I wish I didn't spend thousands of dollars on this program, as well as be forced to pay $500 per month for extensions due to tutors being unavailable to help, projects being obscenely out of date, and it being near impossible to complete it in the given time frame. I would battle with CF for my money back, but it will never happen because at the end of the day, they don't care . Don't waste your time or money!! Updating to address the comment from CareerFoundry: The experience I had is not uncommon at all. Almost every student I have spoken with had an extremely unpleasant experience during this program, from materials being out of date to the mentor/tutor part of the experience being a huge frustration, it was not what we paid for. Not much time has passed since I completed this program and almost my entire portfolio of projects are deprecated or not supported anymore (aka broken).

3994,Careerfoundry,2023-05-19,"My Review of the CF program UI Design program offered by CareerFoundry Changing a career is one of the most challenging paths anyone can take, mainly because it's hard to find the first job. CareerFoundry promises everyone who completes their programs to find a job in a maximum of six months. Is that a real promise, and why should anyone think twice before enrolling in a program at CF? I completed in May 2022 the UI Design program offered by CF. I can talk only about my experience with the program and my experience with job search in this field in my country. The ""Job Guarantee"" to all participants was the main argument that convinced me to enroll in a UI Design program offered by CF. Other things that convinced me were the following: • The program is fully mentored, as well for the UI design as for job preparation • Anyone can enroll without having any relevant or previous experience in the field • The program contains a Job Preparation model, which is supposed to prepare you for finding a job. Despite these advantages that convinced me to enroll in a UI Design program by CF, there are far more disadvantages that must be considered. Namely: 1. Finding a job is culture related. For example, the job market in Germany is different from the USA or France from any other country. The job preparation module offered by CF doesn't prepare the students to find a job in the German market (although the company is based in Berlin). In addition, career specialists are not allocated to students depending on the country where they are looking for a job. For example, a career specialist from Greece has yet to learn how a student can find a job in Germany, especially having zero experience with the German job market. 2. The program curricula need to be updated, be regularly improved, as it's expected to be in tech domains. Consequently, students' portfolio projects made during the CF program must be more consistent to get a job interview with potential employees. Furthermore, the program needs to stress the importance of having a solid portfolio; instead, CF motivates only to get to the end of the course. 3. Even though everyone can enroll in the course without any previous experience in the design field, the UI design program by CF doesn't help you gain the basics of graphic design and UX design. Can anyone build a house without building first the foundation? The same principle applies here, to have a complete package of expertise or a foundation in the field, the students must also take additional courses or training programs afterward to fill gaps that the UI design program CF has. 4. UI design is a part of UX design. Learning UI design without knowing UX design is like building a house without any foundation. In Germany, these two fields are barely separated; if you want a job in UI design, you must know UX too! If you intend to enroll in the UI design program offered by CF, be prepared to take additional courses in UX design too! 5. The program is way too expensive and is not worth it. After enrolling, you will soon realize that any advantages that convinced you to enroll in the program are worth nothing by completing it. The chances of finding a job only with a UI design program by CF are zero percent. From my experience, after completing my certification in UI design and applying the best CF strategies to find a job, I've always got zero job interviews. 6. I started getting more job interviews just after I took a training program in Graphic Design and another program in UX Design. To summarize, the UI Design program at CF is not worth the time and money.",google
3995,Careerfoundry,2023-10-05,"Pros and Cons of enrolling in the Full-Stack Development program offered by CareerFoundry (CF). My Review of the CF program Pros 1. I had a very motivating and supportive tutor, mentor, and career specialist; 2. CF only issues non-credit certificates after completing the courses, but these are authorized by the ZFU (Staatliche Zentralstelle für Fernunterricht) – Germany's state body for distance education. So no academic background is required to enroll in this program; 3. The alum community is friendly, large, collaborative, and international; 4. Once involved in the CF program, the tutor and the mentor assigned to you will help you create or improve your first portfolio projects; 5. The program includes a ""Job Preparation"" module which also includes online meetings with a career specialist for six months to prepare and support you in finding a job; 6. Includes a ""Job Guarantee"" program that supposedly guarantees that you will get a refund if you don't get any job within six months after completing the courses. Cons 1. The curriculum is not well structured and sometimes creates confusion, which inevitably leads to a delay in meeting the set deadlines for the tasks of each module; 2. The study material/curriculum needs to be updated; currently, it is at least 2-3 years out of date. Subsequently, this outdated curriculum prevents any alumni from finding a job, as most employers are looking for up-to-date employees with new technologies; 3. The program claims to teach you web programming languages from scratch without any prior programming knowledge; In reality, however, this program is intended for someone who already has at least the basic knowledge of programming languages. If I did not have an academic background in computer science, I would not have finished this program because the program does not focus on the basics of programming languages. So, if I were now a newbie looking to enroll in a Web Development program, I wouldn't choose CF; 4. After finishing the CF program, you will have to improve your knowledge and skills in the studied field by enrolling in other courses or programs that will help you learn and acquire new skills regarding the new technologies that have been developed in the last 2-3 years; 5. The cost of the CF program in its current state (with an outdated curriculum) is exaggerated; in my opinion, the current program shouldn't cost more than €2000 - 2500; 6. The ""Job Guarantee"" program should be reviewed; I know many alums who have yet to find a job within 7-12 months (or more) of completing CF courses, but CF decided not to return anything, not a penny. Even though their ""Job Guarantee"" program says that everyone will get a refund if they don't get a job within six months of completing the CF courses.",google

I come from a very different background, accustomed to a different way of thinking and working, but the thorough, well-structured and practical curriculum is clear and easy-to follow, making me feel confident every step along the way as I acquire new knowledge and skills as a UX designer. CareerFoundry has devised an exemplary support system to ensure student success. Every student has a dedicated tutor to give assistance, guidance and feedback on coursework, as well as an experienced mentor to provide feedback, insight and context into both coursework and real-life applications of UX. I have been fortunate to have two excellent tutors and two outstanding mentors. (Changes in circumstances led to changes in my tutor and mentor assignments. Although I was reticent to change at first, I soon discovered that CareerFoundry has a large pool of talented and experienced professionals who are dedicated to supporting students along their learning and career path.) I always look forward to video feedback from my tutor and live exchanges with my mentor; they never fail to provide practical feedback, clear and concise explanations, constructive criticism and sincere encouragement. Remote, self-paced learning can bring challenges with it, but CareerFoundry has built a system that optimizes learning and minimizes the sense of distance. With remote work being more and more common since the pandemic hit, it is an added skill to be able to organize one's time independently as well as to communicate and collaborate from a distance. A very user-friendly digital framework offers a dashboard and various communication tools for students to connect with staff, tutors, mentors and one another. The network of students and faculty is international, with participants from all across the globe, which makes for exciting opportunities to make new connections and gain new cultural insights, in addition to the already rich education on offer. I especially value the freedom of the self-paced curriculum. On some days I may feel organized and motivated and on others I struggle with time management. Either way, helpful guidelines in the course dashboard keep me on track. A responsive team is always available to answer questions.

4032,Careerfoundry,2022-04-30,"FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT The program itself has been amazing, a lot of things to learn and practice, lots of exercises and examples etc. What I would change is to strongly suggest to start some lectures about HTML and how the internet works (device requests, servers, HTTP, routing etc) because those three weeks given to finish that part could have been done in 10 days while, for example, Angular or React could have taken much much longer. The beginning is the fundamentals of the course, I would say the pillars of every web developer, so taken these lessons for granted could have meant saving time for a new learner, and investing it into more profitable things like React, React Native, Angular or mention of Vue. In the end, a future candidate is more likely to be asked these arguments rather than basic concepts. Nevertheless, all the lessons and support material were great, my tutor (Blaise) was outstanding and my mentor (Nizar) was just amazing as a professional and personal approach. I strongly suggest this course as an individual trying to change his/her career path or when looking for a practical approach into coding as a web developer. I had very little knowledge about what programming is but now I feel so much more confident and able to elaborate concepts that I could not imagine before. Be clear that it requires a lot of work because this course will give a big base to work on it, it's just the beginning of a never ending learning-path. A Bootcamp it's just like peeling a fruit... Last but not least, when comparing this course to another one, not only one can say that the arguments included in the Bootcamp and wide enough to make it very interesting and complete but also taking it in 6 month full time is such a better choice than having some concepts in just a 12 weeks program, which in my opinion would not be long enough. One more thing: for a German resident is possible to get a Bildungsgutschein, which means that the whole Bootcamp is paid by the government in order to be qualified and ready for the job market.

I'm currently having an ongoing marketing email long after I had unsubscribed from any form of communication with them. Nothing personal but I have found a different alternative and prefer not to be contacted anymore. Reached out and Julia I believe investigated the issue further and confirmed that my unsubscribe was affirmative since a while ago and ended up with the understanding I won't receive more marketing emails. However they did again on the 6th January. I marked them as spam and reported to Gmail, after which deleted the email. The persistent email isn't necessary guys, and it won't change my mind. If anything it gives poor reputation. Like someone said in the review sections, use an American company. Perhaps you'll pay a little more but your privacy will be super respected to the core. Customer service comes first in USA. CareerFoundry is an example of preaching to the choir where they can't fix basic communication issue while they show off themselves as IT training industry.

The course is VERY outdated. There are long pieces of text to read (sadly hardly any video's - come on Careerfoundry - it's 2022!) The long, rambling texts have been translated poorly and incomprehensibly from German. The allocated times for tasks are ridiculous. To give an indication, they say certain tasks will take 6 hours - they will in fact take 35 hours. It's a two year course condensed poorly into 9 months. When inevitably you don't finish in time, you get charged a monthly fee for going over the allocated time. It's a complete money making enterprise. Be prepared to shell out a lot more money than the initial course fee. There are much, much better and cheaper courses out there. I feel like I wasted a year of my life with Careerfoundry. I have started two other courses - the Google UX course £39 a month and LearnUI with Eric Kennedy.

Learning The Tools: Although my experience was smooth and progressed in a good linear fashion, I can see how it may be slightly different for some others. For context, I came into the program with some prior knowledge about the various tools used to create the fancy phone mock-ups and animations. For a completely new person, there might be a learning curve as CF doesn’t go too in-depth on how these programs can be used. Advice For New Students: Essentially what I’m getting at is that, you have to do research outside of what CF actually teaches. Be proactive in expanding your learning on top of each section. The good thing is they provide many links in each task to expand your knowledge. And I highly recommend you read each one. And on top of that watch CF’s YouTube videos. Course Critique For CF: I don’t have many but the main one has to be with the example project within the course “Fisherly”. It seemed very “half done”. Each example deliverable didn’t seem like it would pass in a real world situation. Maybe it was purposefully simplified to not overwhelm students. But In my opinion, I want to see a seasoned designer genuinely go through the process of making a project that they actually put on their portfolio. Just so that I understand what a well done case study actually looks like, instead of having to find my own examples online. Overall: Don’t be afraid of this review, the positives I have for this course heavily out way the critiques. In all honesty the community and support system within CF are top tier and can make your experience 10x better if you’re proactive.",google

4065,Careerfoundry,2022-03-23,"Hello, my name is Szilard and I’m currently on the 1/3rd of the Full Stack Web Development program! Before I started the course I did a little research and found out that the CareerFoundry has the best offer in terms of time and curriculum. This is my first online course so I don’t have any references. My opinion is that the course material is the best you can get in this period of time, I mean 5-6 months, because I am learning full time. The support you have from the CF team is blameless, no matter what kind of problem do you have there is always someone to help! *At the end of the course I’ll come back and edit this review, I’ll write about the job preparation course too!",google
4066,Careerfoundry,2022-03-22,"This program is a good option if you want to change careers and feel lost into where to start your learning journey. I felt overwhelmed by all the online resources, and this program gave me a sense of orientation and discipline. I like the flexibility of the program as it is impossible for me to attend online classes at a fixed schedule. As well, the tutor that I had was very informative and share with me valuable resources to make my learning easier. The Job prep course was one the best things. In the past I had attended a couple of workshops back at university, but this course has an advisor that is almost a 100% committed to give you feedback and prepare you for the job market(this is not easy to find). Overall, the course doesn't cover all the material there is to learn about analytics, but there are always ways to complement that with what you can find online, so this is not a deal breaker for me. At the end, it was a good decision because I have accomplished close to 70% of the course and I have covered most of the fundamental topics required in a job.",google

Other programs/universities have always left me feeling on my own and in the dark, and I’m so thankful to have found CF. The whole team is SO eager to help, and having a tutor and mentor that truly care about their students is an absolute game changer. The program as well as it’s tutors/mentors make you feel like they not only care, but want to (and are) setting you up for success. I couldn’t be happier with my experience so far.",google
4068,Careerfoundry,2022-03-20,"Currently on web development course (Achievement 4) and I'd like to post how I have felt thorough this course. 1, Mentor and Tutor system : So far so good, you can ask anytime about your questions and if you want face to face video call with mentor, you can book a phone call. However, my mentor call is always a week, most of the time two weeks ahead, so often I cannot ask what I want when I need it. My tutor is more flexible although he is only available on Slack or CF text message when you submit a task. It normally takes more than 24 hours and up to 48 hours to get an answer which is CF standard. 2, Student support : I really appreciate their support. Whenever I ask question, they reply immediately or sometimes one day. They are supportive and offer solution. 3, Achievement(tasks): In my personal opinion so far, it's not really good and unnecessary frustrating and sad because it's the most important part. I need another school which costs about EUR200/year to get an idea what's going on these CF lessons and it's much less frustrating and easier to understand than when I study with CF. Especially about React, almost everything is very confusing, lack of small exercises to build up/ solidify knowledge but just throwing information and codes, then task like if you don't know just ask your tutor which takes time. It just takes time, about Redux, first task is to create small code to see how it works which is good, then next one is ""apply Redux to user state"" like no practice but code about gathering movies and some hints about some function which I have never used. Sometimes it's very hard to understand only by text, it would've been better if there had been more pictures of how it works and small exercises to get an idea what's going on (not just ""play around with this code""). So overall I don't recommend this web development course for a several thousand euro. Thanks to my mentor, I managed to finish the course. Like I mentioned above, achievement 3 isn't good but it became better after this. Also, I really appreciate job preparation course. It was really helpful to polish my LinkedIn profile and resume, applying job and making connection. I have no complaint. Overall, I recommend this course although I said I don't a few months ago. You just need to pass achievement 3.",google
4069,Careerfoundry,2022-03-19,"--WEB DEVELOPMENT COURSE-- Until almost halfway through the program, the content is well structured and you can follow the program without much prior knowledge (even if there is better free content on sites like freecodecamp or codecademy). Unfortunately, once you have completed half of the course (and therefore lose any chance of a partial refund), the quality of the course materials deteriorates so much that you can no longer follow without relevant prior knowledge. The tutor and mentor do their best here, but unfortunately (due to the large number of students) they usually cannot take the time to really deal with the course participants' problems. Later in the job you have to teach yourself a lot, that much is clear, but if the learning process and how to get started cannot be explained to you and the mistakes you make can be pointed out to you in a useful way, you will quickly be lost. Contact with the student advisors is also not helpful here. After 4 weeks of various email contact, I can only say: the student advisors try to calm you down and say that the learning process has ups and downs. However, they couldn't and wouldn't comply with my request for additional explanations and support in finding a private tutor (even though I also live in Berlin - and an educational institution like CareerFoundry has access to hundreds of graduates who may be able to help you if you have difficulties small payment could help). But they weren't interested in that. I cannot recommend this course to anyone who is thinking about retraining or pursuing a new career path. There will come a point when you will be left to yourself and your fate. I'm actually a quick learner, but this course brings you to the brink of despair. I have pointed out several times in my emails to CareerFoundry that I don't like saying what I think of the course in this way, but that they should please help me make my experience better and not comment on the comment with ""sorry"" etc . There was no interest in finding a reasonable solution to this problem.",google

My only criticisms are that there have been some minor mistakes in the lessons and sometimes it takes longer than I would like to get in touch with my teachers. That said, CareerFoundry has always been accommodating with extra time to finish my course when there were technical problems out of my control. I haven’t begun my job search yet, so I can’t speak to that part of the program. That said, I’ve looked over the curriculum for the Job Preparation part of the course and it is very thorough!",google
4073,Careerfoundry,2021-01-06,"This design course was a fantastic experience! I'm a graphic design student with only my associates, but I opted to go with CareerFoundry rather than taking more classes for a bachelor's. I felt I could gain more experience in a shorter time for a lower cost. With that being said, here's my experience in detail: 1. The Information - To let you know right out the gate, it's a good amount of reading, and your experience will only be enhanced if you read the multitude of links and resources they provide. The information itself is a solid way to understand your design app, and the overall design process. It also helps to give insights on what you will be doing in the workplace which is a nice addition. I will say that aside from a couple of times, they never get too detailed on their topics. Each task will have you jumping around from topic to topic trying to learn everything you're reading, and depending on how fast you want to complete the course, it could be a lot to take in - but it's entirely worth it. 2. The tutor/mentor experience - My tutor has been wonderful. With rapid feedback, and giving real world expectations, I've been able to constantly be critiqued and judged based on whether a design is solid or lacking something. I think that the tutor itself is worth the money, because being able to have feedback from an experienced professional at the drop of a hat is incredibly important to growing as a designer. My mentor has also been a great way of learning about what I should expect in the workplace, learning about what and what not to say during interviews, talking about design trends, how they got their first job as a designer, and many more topics. 3. The price - I believe I payed around 6,500 USD, and I can confidently say, without even getting into the Job Preparation Course or the Specialization Course yet, that I would do it again in a heartbeat. I think that for everything you get, the price of a semester at a 4 year college is definitely worth the investment. You learn everything you need to jump into the workforce, and UI/UX designers make quite a bit more in comparison to graphic designers for example. Being able to pay that back after finding a position in a month or two, for up to 9 months of feedback, learning, and conversations with people in the industry? That's value! Overall I recommend CareerFoundry to anyone who wants to advance as a designer, or move into the design field from a different field entirely. You'll learn what the real advantages are when it comes to having a different skill set, and be excited even more about how you can use it to become an even better UI designer.",google

It is helpful to know an average time, but has been a source of discouragement when I have needed to spend a lot of additional time on a project. Talking to my mentor has definitely help me set more realistic expectations and determine when I am being a perfectionist and just need to submit my assignment vs when I need to spend additional time working on something.

4081,Careerfoundry,2021-05-24,"Overall I am extremely happy with choosing CareerFoundry. I enrolled in the UX Bootcamp in September 2020, and it took me a while to get used to taking an online course. Not easy to sit down and study on your own, right? What I liked about CareerFoundry was having a tutor and mentor to talk to. This was a huge asset for me. So, the first thing I did was that I started booking weekly video calls with my mentor to get a sense of how it is to be a UX designer. As a result, I got more engaged with the curriculum and finished my first project by October and got my Intro to UX certificate. The UX design program in CareerFoundry includes three sections: · Intro to UX: you design an app from scratch with an overview of the user research, wireframing and prototyping · Immersion: you will get a chance to design another app from scratch. This time you learn much more details · Specialization: you will choose your specialization from existing courses and move further to become a professional UX designer In addition to this, once you have passed half of the program, the job preparation course will be unlocked for you (if you are eligible for the course). In the job preparation course, you get a chance to work on your resume, cover letter, LinkedIn profile and creating your elevator pitch. You will have a professional career coach for this course too. Moreover, you will be connected to other students and your peers on the CareerFoundry Slack channel. You can find a study buddy, get feedback on your project, get help from others, help them on their project, and share your thoughts and concerns for job applications later on. To sum it up, I felt very supported by CareeFoundry. It was like they were taking me step by step toward my new career by teaching me all the tips for being successful in finding my first job as a UX designer.",google

I also need to add that the customer service rep who I was on a call with prior to registration was top notch and very helpful to allowing me to make an informed decision among the various options based in Toronto. Being someone who is switching career and with no design background whatsoever, CareerFoundry's student advisor, tutor, and mentor had been very helpful and encouraging. I realized that some of the topics may seem too bite size for people with some design background. However, the overall curriculum had been very helpful for my progress to becoming a UX designer. One thing that to keep in mind is that the curriculum offered at CareerFoundry is self-paced with occasional reminders from student advisor if you're off track. This is not something for those with a lack of self discipline or determination on making it as a UX designer. I have just started the job preparation course, so I cannot comment too much on the job assistance part but there is a job guarantee feature to the program (given that you stick to some of the requirements e.g. applying to 5 jobs each week after the design part of the program is done) I have just completed the UX Immersion course, and began the UI specialization! To wrap things up, I can definitely tell that I'm making tremendous progress and while the future does feel uncertain for a career switcher like myself, I do feel more confident in my abilities and more comfortable to call myself a designer.",google

4088,Careerfoundry,2021-05-17,"Outdated, old-fashioned management style. An absurd policy of the company stands above the needs of students. This school is not for people who are searching for themselves, who want to experiment, try different things, and improve. Here you are asked to choose one project from only 4 options. Even if you immediately realize that you would like to change the project without starting anything and it wouldn't affect the work of either the mentor or the school or anyone else, you must not change anything. You are basically married to an unpleasant project for 7 months and forced to pay dearly for it. Such a model contradicts real life. All modern companies that care about the well-being of employees provide an opportunity to change responsibilities, departments, as well as universities allow to change the topics of bachelor's and master's thesis, because that's life and the human mind is not a stone, but a constantly changing entity. It must be allowed to change things if the new decision is in line with the aims and interests much better than the previous decision. I was simply shocked by the radical policy of this UX Bootcamp, so I asked only to stop my future payments, but since I have paid for this month, I was expecting to continue to read and copy my notes until the end of the month, but they just deleted my profile without any warning. In addition to this experience, I would also like to add that the platform itself is a bit outdated and not intuitive, full of bugs. Tutors are mostly young students who have just completed Carreerfoundry and never worked as UX designers. I was promised high-level professionals who are carefully selected, but from the beginning, I got an inexperienced tutor, I saw clearly his experience in Linkedin, but for a whole week, I had to argue with Carreefoundry advisors because they continued to claim that everyone is a high-class professional, ignoring my comments and failing to acknowledge errors. After a week of stress, however, they changed teachers for me, but keep in mind that if you are not a fighter and you do not have the strength to fight for your rights, you can get non-professionals for which you will have to pay a large sum of money.",google

As an already established professional with almost a decade of experience within creative industries under my belt, I decided to take this course as a means of upskilling. One thing I’d have to point out though is that CareerFoundry’s UX Design course many times seems more strongly geared towards recent college graduates or people very early on in their career path.

I feel that the Career Foundry course and the exercises we were required to do have given me a good, real world foundation into the world of UX Design. An online course requires a large degree of self discipline (something I admittedly struggle with) but I was able to work through it and fall into a rhythm that helped me get through. The information provided seemed up to date and relevant to the real world and constant contact with my tutor and mentor (both current professionals) helped reinforce that. I found both of them to be top notch, always giving me precise feedback and suggestions on how I can improve my work. The student advisors were always helpful and provided quick responses (within 24 hours) to any organizational questions I had. Their Slack student community was also a plus, providing peer review, anecdotes and support when things got tough. It's also a great source of networking. Negatives? I suppose the online format can be a challenge as there is no instructor on a zoom call, for example. Lots of reading and tasks to perform every day. It can be a lot to juggle. I found the Career Foundry website and the messaging a bit wonky. Ironically hard to navigate and the tutors/mentors didn't always get our messages. I'll see once I start working in my new field if it was enough to get a foot in the door. Did I learn anything? I'd say so. I only knew this subject matter peripherally through my current job. It will be up to me to practice what I've learned through self-directed challenges so I can really absorb and internalize it. I would recommend this program as it is well organized and logically put together. Each exercise builds off of the knowledge you'd learned before and concepts are repeated so that you don't forget. Only time will tell if it is enough for me to transition into this new career.",google

4135,Careerfoundry,2020-06-16,"Worst decision! I did find this course way overpriced for what it is and expected a more in-depth learning experience. Especially when I came in-person to show my old portfolio and asked how much this course will help develop my skill set and got the idea it will improve dramatically. Ok, so let's see what I got from Career Foundry for a few thousand euros: Most if not all of the information in the courses you can find online for free or for something around 30 euros in places like Udemi, so what you are paying for is the Feedback from the mentors and tutors, The biggest downside for me was not having any actual feedback frim my mentor for most of the course, I had to beg to change my first mentor after being unreachable when he kept just canceling calls that were scheduled for his timetable. I hope to have a mentor that will give me tips for improvement and not just say a ""Good Job, looks great"" even there are many ways to improve the project, and I ended up calling to my friends that are working in the field and asked for their help instead of the mentor. After sending 5 emails telling how bad my mentor situation was, I had to wait for my new mentor, I finally got my second mentor, she was really helpful and I finally got the help I wanted for my project, But on our first call she mentioned she gonna leave for a vacation in a few weeks. For the time she was missing I got another mentor that in one of the reviews (for a recipe app)just told me"" I like the app Green Chef I like the logo as its a chef and his color is a green, very good choice of colors.."", wow this feedback it's really helped me. The ""nice"" mentor was only available for a third of the course length. If one of the Career Foundry team members is reading this review, please go to my account history , if you can go and see any helpful feedback from the 2 other mentors I will be surprised. At the end of the course, I definitely didn't like the projects that I created and knew my portfolio is not good enough for getting hired. Now, a few months after the course has ended I made a few new projects that look much better (No support/feedback from CF, just from friends) I thought that Career Foundry will help me to get interviews, but 4 months after finishing the course and I only had 1 interview. I tried to get any job I could find. I spent over 4 months applying for UI/UX jobs and well nothing happened.

4143,Careerfoundry,2020-09-06,"As a full-time employee, I was pretty hesitant when looking at in-person and online bootcamps. What made me choose CareerFoundry was the flexibility of the program, the curriculum (you can tell it’s structured and written by professionals who know what they are doing) and the responsiveness of the staff. You feel like you belong to a team of people who genuinely want you to succeed, I have never seen them denying assistance to anyone, whatever the step they were in. Someone wrote that you can find most of the materials of the course online and for free — it’s true, but I don’t think the material should be the reason why one enrolls at CF. You choose CF because you don’t want to take all the steps by yourself, because you want to be backed by a strong community and a tutor, and a mentor, who carefully review your tasks and make it easier for you to identify your areas of improvement. I know myself and I know I struggle to keep the motivation alive (especially when I have to study after a full work day) and I’m sure I wouldn’t be able to do all this if it wasn’t for Carlo and Sophie guiding me through the course, providing precious insights based on their hands-on experience in the field. For me, the real value of CF is ultimately the “human” aspect. Don’t expect, though, that you won’t be doing research on your own and expand your knowledge on other resources. I strongly recommend deepening your UX knowledge on your own, based on your interests and your career plan: it’s an ever-evolving field so the sooner your start, the better, especially because some chapters are a great starting point but are not exhaustive in themselves. They give you the right direction, then it's up to you to carve your own path. Speaking strictly about the workload, I am pretty ahead of the milestones while working full-time, so the deadlines feel quite reasonable. I can’t say much about the job assistance because I have just started the job preparation course, but it looks up-to-date. I even started applying some of the knowledge I learned during these months in my current job and it’s very rewarding: I look forward to finishing the course and seeing what the future holds for me in this wonderful field.",google

There are so many courses available that I relied on reviews to seal the final decision, so I thought I should add my review as well. After reading reviews I went with CareerFoundry : UX Designer course. The main reason for choosing this was the reviews, and the job guarantee. Also their interface looked clear and the content really focused on the career changer. and that resonated with me. Decision made, I started the course in the summer of 2018 and managed to complete it by June/July 2019. The course is tough, it is time consuming and to keep up with deadlines certain other time sacrifices must be made. But I found the course fascinating and I felt really driven to finish the course so I managed to keep up with the progress indicators. The mentors are great (mine for UX was, Carlo Van Der Pluijim) , they challenge, support and keep you on the right track as you go along, tough but fair is how I would describe them. It's good that they pull you up on certain aspects of your work, as the whole point is to get you into a UX job, so you might as well do it right. As the course progresses you start working with a career advisor ( the one assigned to me was Richard Learthart). Richard helps you craft your previous skills into a great looking CV. His attention to detail and my work, definitely got me my first interview (and then job).These sessions and submissions are invaulable, probably best to start this half way through your UX course, it's more work but it gets you prepared for the next stage. Perhaps it was with luck, but also hard work and good support from the mentors and career advisors, I landed a great job (UX desginer) within the first month of finishing the course. I think location is key, be prepared to move if you are in a remote area. This course is very good, and it will equip you well for the career change. It's not easy, and it does fill your time, but it is well worth it. If UX interests you, then I recommend this course, highly.",google

It gives you useful advice and provides tools, not only on structuring your CV and cover letter, but also introspecting on your transferable skills and the broader picture of a job-hunt process. I would like to mention that all CF career specialists are experts on the subject and very helpful (and continue to be, even after course completion). They always get back to you with advice, feedback and great links for further reading etc. Studying with CareerFoundry has been a very positive experience for me.",google

The lessons are thorough, well organized and feel relevant for today's job market. I always felt like I was learning things that had real value, and would be immediately applicable to the job environment. The support from their mentors is a huge help, too. Never once during the entire course did I feel like I was alone, there was always somebody there to help. They also have a Slack channel with various groups so students can communicate, share feedback and work together on projects. I really felt (and still feel) like I was part of a community, and that made for a great learning experience. Once I finished the course, I took advantage of their 'Job Prep Course', which is available to students who complete the UX Design course. For the three weeks that followed, I worked with their career specialists to refine my resume, create a portfolio and receive mentorship on things like how to network, how to search for jobs effectively, how to prepare for an interview and more... For anyone considering getting into UX Design, I would 100% recommend looking into this course.",google
4165,Careerfoundry,2019-11-12,"This review is for the Fullstack Web Dev course. The course is essentially one third HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery with the other two thirds being Ruby on Rails (building an E-commerce site specifically). The content is clear and well-explained and there are always links to further resources in case you want to go a step further and learn more on top of the core exercise material. I was always encouraged and motivated by my tutor whenever I handed in exercises. I didn't have much interaction with my mentor - only 3 or 4 Skype calls I think. I think he would have been available via PM if I had needed to contact him though. What sets the course apart from others is being able to interact with CF staff during and after the course, whether it be to get help with exercises or to ask for career advice. Being able to reach out to industry experts in this way is something that I've found very useful. On the otherhand, the information in the curriculum is nothing that you couldn't find online in other cheaper or free courses. That's not to say the content isn't good, just that there are a lot of great free or cheap resources out there to learn web dev at the moment. I also thought the course was a bit lacking on teh JavaScript front. There were only a handful of exercises out of the 67 total that focused on this.",google

The course is well structured, up to date and it covers every step in the life cycle of the app. Slack community is also very active and supportive, specially the designing students. As in the start I mentioned that I havent completed the course yet, because of which I havent interacted with the career change team but because the other CF team is so supportive and good in their jobs its safe to assume that they are good too ( but surely I will keep u updated 😉 ) Before I finish my review let me tell you one very important thing, the whole journey is not walk in the park, if you seriously want to achieve your goal (what ever that is, career change or improving your skills etc) you have to work really hard for yourself, from time to time you will face problems whose solutions are not straight forward and make you pull your hairs out, but the effort which you will do in solving them is the fruit of the whole journey.

I took it because I wanted to gain more knowledge on UX design and also have the academic trainee and the official certification. The first part of the course was the most interesting, it's focused on UX thinking, business goals, competitor analysis, usability, prototypes, etc... Then we started with wireframes, user flows, visual design and google analytics. This second part was something I already knew so I didn't took much advantage of it. But if you are a beginner, it will be useful. It took me almost 3 months to finish the course and I spent around 3-4 hours per day (every day you have a different subject so you have to go through the content and then complete the assignment). You will have a mentor and you can ask him/her everything you need, that’s pretty cool. The course worth the money.

In order to get more practice the course shoud be longer because some skills they just need practice and time to be developped. Also the course prepared me on how to present my work and my creative processes to potential employers, which I think has been very useful. I also found very useful the active student community, I have got great help from it. For example, I got to know other fellow students who have ended up helping me a lot on my portfolio and job application documents and it has been a useful source to start networking.

Living in Wales, I was able to apply for government funding to cover the costs of the course and I’m aware there are other funding support options in different places. COMMUNITY: The support available at CI is exceptional - there is access to a community slack channel which also extends indefinitely after the course. Here there are many staff, students and alumni available to connect with for support and to boost morale - it is also well moderated by the CI staff so is a friendly environment and easy to keep updated with current events etc. CONTENT: The course content and structure is very comprehensive, although some of the later sections are heavy to complete with video and reading material, on the whole there is a good mix of learning resources. I would recommend that there are more options to break down the material / suit different learning styles - eg I found myself having to add video screenshots to my notes so I could follow the project tutorials better. The projects are well structured and were a great way to put into practice the skills you’ve been learning. I was assigned a mentor to help with planning and keeping on track during the project which was also helpful. The assessment process is very thorough and does challenge you to fulfil all the criteria of a high standard web application - documentation, coding syntax, functionality and UX, testing, accessibility etc. The online tutor support is also brilliant when you’re stuck on sections of the course or fixing bugs in your projects. It can be intermittent during busy times, but the tutors were friendly and super helpful. HACKATHONS: I’ve now attended 3 hackathons with CI, one of which was a hybrid event hosted in person by Google and Trust in SODA, London. A hackathon is run every month by a team of mostly volunteers, and it’s such a valuable experience for learning and collaborating on a coding project with a team.

I feel that they cover a lot but very superficially, which is not necessarily bad because you get a taste of everything and on your own can go deeper in the knowledge (as EVERY developer has to do) but it is not great as some concepts are very important and should have been given more attention. I am lucky to have studied previously and that I have a senior developer as husband so I can cry for help very easily, but I often kept thinking about the ‘less fortunate’. All the content can be found free on the internet (as everything related to tech nowadays) but they have an easy way of teaching, it is organized and you get to do projects that will be evaluated and you can get feedback on it.

First of all the assessment grading policy, I feel, is very harsh and discourages spending a lot of time on each project. This is because if every area of your project is distinction level but there is one area which is pass level, you will be given a pass which I feel is unfair.

While many teams opted for traditional Christmas-themed projects, our team, The Frostbytes, felt empowered to think outside the box. This freedom allowed us to develop our award-winning project, Discover Diwali, which not only introduced a lesser-known holiday to a broader audience but also championed the values of diversity and inclusion. The support from the organizers and facilitators was exceptional. From quick responses to questions, to helpful check-ins, they made sure every participant felt heard and supported throughout the event. The clear structure of the Hackathon, including daily standups, guidance on the judging criteria, and reminders of key deadlines, kept us focused and motivated. Special mention goes to the judging process. It was clear, transparent, and rooted in specific, meaningful criteria, which made every team’s efforts feel recognized. We appreciated how the criteria emphasized not just functionality, but also creativity, inclusivity, and user experience. It was this focus on storytelling, accessibility, and engagement that ultimately drove the success of our project. Finally, the sense of community and camaraderie in this Hackathon was unlike anything I’ve experienced before. Collaborating with teammates from different time zones and diverse skill sets taught us new technical skills, while also enhancing our teamwork and agile planning abilities. Tools like Kanban, Canvas, and GitHub were integrated into the workflow seamlessly, and the experience felt much like a real-world project.

Their expertise, coupled with their genuine commitment to student success, created an encouraging and motivating learning environment. They were always available to provide guidance, answer questions, and offer insights that enriched my understanding of the material. One of the standout aspects of this bootcamp is its focus on real-world applicability and career readiness. The skills I acquired were directly applicable to my role in tech sales at IBM, where a deep understanding of software development processes is crucial. This knowledge has not only enabled me to communicate more effectively with technical teams but also to offer valuable solutions to clients, thereby driving my professional growth. The career services and recruitment support provided by Code Institute were instrumental in my job search and career progression. The dedicated career coaches helped me refine my resume, prepare for interviews, and develop a compelling personal brand. Additionally, the bootcamp's strong network of industry connections and partnerships with top tech companies facilitated numerous recruitment opportunities. This comprehensive support system played a crucial role in securing my position at IBM. The bootcamp also facilitated incredible networking opportunities, connecting me with like-minded individuals and industry professionals. These connections have been invaluable for continuous learning and career advancement. Thanks to the comprehensive education and support I received at Code Institute, I have experienced significant personal and professional growth. The program equipped me with the tools and confidence to excel in the fast-paced world of tech sales and achieve my career aspirations.

Unfortunately, learning that the course will now commence in April 2025 significantly disrupts my plans. I had reorganized and re-planned my schedule based on the initial October start date.

Initially, the sales team assured me that there were no exams, only project-based assessments. However, these projects are graded, effectively serving as exams, and the final certification reflects the grades obtained. Another significant issue is the course structure. It lacks instructional videos for each section, relying heavily on text with minimal examples or images. The challenges provided are overly simplistic, offering little practical application, which makes it challenging to stay engaged and requires extra effort to maintain focus.

4223,Code institute,2023-12-15,"Signed up for the Full Stack Diploma Course and basically feel like this company stole my money. Several parts of the course are out of date - many of the parts had not been updated since 2019 from looking at the code - and they simply say ""it is up to the student to keep up to date on trends in the industry"". Mentors are not available 24/5 and on weekends as they claim - most of the mentors have main jobs and their Code institute thing is a side gig and so are not available as readily as they claim. My mentor was from Nigeria (a very smart and nice dude who worked full time) but I suspect this is another profitability measure. Many of them also have little professional experience but are graduates of the course - they claim this is ""by design"". Whenever communicating with the Student Care Team, you would receive a generic Copy & Paste response and one of the favourite things is ""consult the Stack Community"". Stack is this poor man's reddit that they have which is, frankly, an absolute mess and you can never find anything on it. On the basis of all of the issues I encountered with the company and course, I asked to be de-registered from the course and have my money refunded but they constantly delayed replying to this - the head of the Student Care Team took literally weeks and would never respond without me emailing again. I do have plans to pursue this further, but safe to say, there is a reason why ""schools"" like Code Institute didn't exist 10 years ago. As a comparison: A year's Code Academy Pro membership is at most $720US (There are many offers as well with CA that get you 50% discount and so on too - I paid $160US! ) compared to the €1000s these guys are trying to swindle! There is a far wider array of courses available as well as different career paths. The materials are far more rounded and give the proper historical, contextual and scientific background to the things that you're learning rather than simply being like ""do this and google the rest later!"". Instructions are also far clearer and you are properly tested on knowledge before you can move on to the next stage of a course or lesson. This is not the case with Code Institute as their Input Validation code is glitchy as hell and not user friendly in the slightest. There are a number of other providers like Datacamp, Udemy etc who all have more and better materials at a cheaper price! Long story short: Go with Code Academy for more and better learning materials and service for a fraction of the price! Code Institute is just out to swindle money when there are far better and cheaper options available! UPDATE: 5th December 2023. I was contacted by email by the Student Care Team on 10th November and replied to them on 13th November asking why they were refusing to refund my money. As of 5th December, no response.",google

Not only do you learn a stack that is always being improved by highly experienced industry professionals but you develop the ability to learn and approach other languages and technologies that will benefit your new skill set long after you finish the course. The careers week at the end is also extremely valuable as it helps prepare you by hearing from industry experts and from recruiters working in that field.

I'm happy that I now have a good portfolio of milestone and Hackathon projects that I can present to potential employers. The slack community is strong, and I find that a key metric for student's success.

The Hackathons are a great way to learn, get stuck in and challenged, while also giving team members the confidence to continue as they realise that ""they can do it"". It's also a great way to make new friends. Student support is good, and it's good to get ""nudged"" regularly to ensure timely studies and work.

I paid €6k to create projects I could've done myself before the course, to get no diploma at the end of it or a good portfolio. €6k for no good reason. I asked for a refund, to no avail. A company doing €10+ million in revenue a year don't have the decency to refund an innocent teenager who they courted to do the course by selling a dream of 'future employment within 6 months' and by using their other marketing angles on their ads and sales calls. Please keep in mind that the majority of the good feedback on this page is for the free 5-day course, not the full diploma course. Code Institute made a wise decision by flooding this page with favourable reviews for free content, drowning out those of us who committed substantial money but were profoundly disappointed by a lack of content, service, and interaction. They really don't care about you, and will hunt you like crazy for money - even after my payment terms ended they charged me ""by accident"".

4239,Code institute,2022-10-03,"The short answer is the course is a full stack program, but it's absolutely not worth the money. I completed approx 70% of the learning material and submitted 3 projects before deciding that the Code Institute boot camp was a waste of time. Online boot camps have a lot of cheaper alternatives to contend with and that can present a problem for boot camps, who must have something special to bring them beyond someone seeking cheaper alternatives. Right from the get go, the Code Institute has issues, it's HTML course is weak, doesn't cover some basic aspects of website design and has a challenge system that is too restrictively coded at times, so that correct code submissions come back with errors. Hints are generally not helpful, and time can be wasted trying to find errors in your code where it turns out they were looking for an rgba input even thought the instructions were to put in an rgb. Often here the issue is less with the coding but more with understanding what they want you do. It doesn't help that the course is often reams of text with a challenge on another page, meaning if you want to check something, you need to either dance between webpages or have multiple tabs open, which can throw off their progress system. Sure these are minor issues, but also they're generally unique to Code Institute. My overall experience of going through the HTML section was it was beyond lackluster, I opted to supplement my learning with another course. I found this second non Code Institute course to be vastly superior in all metrics, more complete content, better presentation, more coding challenges, better coding challenges, clearer instruction. These issues just pile up the more you go through the course. One of the more egregious issues runs with parts of the course that are out of date. More often than not there's just a quick note attached to the top of a video to ignore a chunk of it and do something else, or the video starts with setting up a legacy coding environment Code Institute no longer uses. Some of these videos are pushing 2 years, so this patchwork of fixes becomes the norm. Again generally looking at other coding courses I've conducted, and no other course is so out of date. The coding projects aren't particularly inspiring either, rather than provide any real instruction, it's a more free from 'do something'. Issues with really stem from a lack of clear understanding of what is required for submission. Code Institute don't present examples of pass/merit/distinction of projects and the mark scheme is vague and uninformative. It didn't help that my mentor wasn't available for 2 of the 3 projects I submitted, and was only available for the last night of the other one. The overall feeling I got was to not be adventurous or push yourself, just do a simple and safe project, which I feel is a terrible way of assessing potential. Feedback from the project submissions is similarly vague and often questionable, but ultimately unhelpful. As someone who has teaching and mentoring experience as a postdoc, the feedback is just lazy. This should be a real strength of a bootcamp but with the Code Institute, it's just another missed opportunity turned into a weakness. I really wanted to use the Code Institute as the core for my learning experience and entry into coding, I was drawn into the rather nicely setup and laid out 5 day coding challenge, which is a good experience. However I came away from every module with a deep dissatisfaction in the learning outcomes. More and more I found myself going to other courses to learn material that should be covered in sufficient depth in the Code Institute subject matter.",google
4240,Code institute,2023-10-02,"I have only done a few intro coding courses with free online resources before this course. This software development online course started off well with the HTML, CSS modules but then JavaScript and Python modules were intensely complicated, covering a lot of concepts and the majority of the time I was left to research and google on my own to understand what was being taught. Tutor support is available but i would have to wait on average 45 - 120 mins for each question and that is not a guarantee they could help as some of them are also recent graduates of the course. I've had many times the tutor's shift ended and they abruptly tell me that and I would have to wait for another tutor to help, they often made me feel stupid and had an arrogant and obnoxious attitude, although there were a few good humble tutors too. Mentor support is for when you do the milestone projects you get 30 - 60 mins each time and you are given technical advice and how to proceed with the project. I didn't really resonate with my mentor but was discouraged to change as I had already started with him. He was telling me that coding was basically fixing coding problems, so you would spend most of your time googling and researching on the internet finding the answers and even when you've been working as a developer for so many years you still don't know that much. Project assessments are a bit random as the feedback tells you to test or code another way that was not taught on the course, which is really strange and puts you up to fail. And they sternly advise you not to share your feedback with anyone else which is again strange. My overall experience is that they just want your money and the support is sorely lacking for something so complicated. This course is adequate if you already know a lot or have developer friends to help you out and you have lots and lots of time and energy to research. Also if you don't mind getting frustrated frequently because you don't know what you're doing and you have to figure it out yourself. You don't really learn to create your own code or syntax, you just copy and paste code from the video tutorials, the understanding of the syntax is not addressed. Don't be swayed by the course being university accredited I had asked them who are the external assessors are and they still haven't been able to answer that.

And the first piece of code I’d ever written was two years ago. I’ve never been a ‘computer person.’ I was good at maths at school (logical/good at problem solving), but never thought I’d ever be into programming. About two years ago I thought I’d give it a go, and really enjoyed it! When I realised I wanted a career in web development, I thought I should probably do a proper course in it (arguably not necessary, but an awful lot easier).After coming across this diploma, an initial phone call where I confirmed my interest and then going through the sign up process, I started. I was gently eased into the course, both in terms of the course content and pace but also in terms of having a mentor assigned to me to help me out with my coursework - Jim was a crucial part of each piece of coursework. As the course got more tricky, I realised the importance and necessity of self-motivation and perseverance - those qualities are a big part of what got me through the course. Do bear that in mind. The tutor service was also a big part of getting me through the challenges of web development - they’re quick to respond (within their working hours of course), yet without spoon-feeding you the answer. Overall, I would definitely recommend this course. It’s no easy course - the qualification, a Diploma in Software Development, as I understand it is equivalent to completing the first two years of university.

I am also going through the bootcamp through Springboard which makes is absolutley free for me. Paying €8,000 for this course is the equivalent of throwing your money into the fire. 1. The course is outdated. Several videos are 2-3 years old with a comment box above the videos saying how to ""remedy"" the issue.

The way the ""instructors"" teach is horrific, they fly through the videos telling you what to do but not actually offering anything of informative value. They are all just code along videos which doesnt help anyone. It just makes you walkthrough dependant. 3. From what I have learned while trying to become a software developer is that you must google everytthing which is perfectly fine.

I have spent 90% of my time on other sites I.E Coding with Mosh, YouTube, W3schools and Udemy learning as the CI's attmept to teach is pathetic. 4. Up until project 4, the course is a solid 3/5, This is only because you can teach basic HTML, CSS, JS, and Python to anyone that wants to learn. When it gets to project 4 and you actually have to start coding and start learning about the full stack development the course just becomes a joke. I could write all day but im just drained from this ""Bootcamp"". Biggest waste of time. Thank God I didnt pay for it. Ps. From reading other reviews that people have left similar to mine, I know Code institute will come back with some passive aggresive response, without actually outlining any benefitial rebuttal to my review. So thanks in advance CI.",google

It has also a community network which stays to you also after you graduate from the course and I found that really interesting. The course structure is such that one can choose the area he would like to focus on later on his career, whether that is a sector or backend vs frontend having substantial skills gained from this whole year. I strongly recommend it !!",google
4255,Code institute,2019-12-10,"When my kids had both started school I realised it was time for me to do something with myself. I wondered about going back to my old job in IT support, but I hadn't really enjoyed it and I'd been away from it for so long I would have had to retrain. So after some mucking about with free courses online and a couple of Python books I took on Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development. I was able to study at home while my kids were at school, and completed the course in just over a year. I had wanted to be a developer but I hadn't been sure which language to go for - I was finding I'd start learning something, then find I'd need to learn something else in order to understand it, then I'd need to learn something else and so on. I was tying myself up in knots. This course covers a wide range of web development technologies in a well structured manner, from HTML, CSS and Javascript all the way to Python and databases, with a few libraries and frameworks for good measure. You don't get spoon fed information - what I experienced was that in each module I was given enough information to understand the basic concepts, and taught the tools used to go and find the answers for myself. At the end of each module I was given a project brief and, with the knowledge and tools the course had given, I was able to build my own web application from scratch, based on the brief. This was then assessed and the marks given back to me along with feedback on where I did well or could have done better. I found this was always really beneficial in helping me know what areas to focus on for the next project. I was assigned a mentor who was always happy to help, I was also part of a vast student community on Slack, who are all doing the same course and could offer help and advice where needed. Now I have learnt so much that I am the one doing the helping on Slack! After completing the course I was able to get a job as a Web Developer within a few weeks, and my confidence is still building. I wouldn't be here without the CI course. Yes, it is expensive, however a free course could never offer the same support community, structured learning or assessment feedback that I think benefitted me so much. Definitely worth it - and I'll be earning the money back within a few months anyway!",google
4256,Code institute,2017-06-16,"I completed the online course in August 2016 and I was part of the first cohort of students that took the course online. It is a challenging course to take especially if you are working full time as you have to organise your time as best as you can. And just keep going at it! You have to study 10-12 hours a week and practice at the same time to get your skills up and going. The mentor sessions were just ok, could have been a lot better. But the guys in Code Institute are great. They are really helpful and they will do everything they can to help you out. I believe the course is improving as time goes by. It does teach you all the actual technologies. No college teaches you Angular or MongoDB. Code Institute do! If you want a change in your career I believe this is the place to go!

4258,Code institute,2020-05-13,"As former graduated from the Full-stack software development programme, I can not recommend this course enough if you are serious about learning code. You can expect to get a good understanding of the world of programming in a relatively short span of time and expect to be ready to start/change career. Obviously, you will be far from being an expert in the field but, if you put the work, you should feel comfortable to step it up at a professional level. Don't expect to be a walk in the park, you must put the work. But if I done it without previous coding experience, anyone can also do it. It will be challenging and demanding at times but it will be worth it in the end. I promise. I decided to take the full time route, Monday to Sunday (+50 hours week) as I wanted to fully focus on it, but it can be done at a slower pace too. Perhaps that would be a far better approach if you don't want to rush trough things. Just make sure if you do it part time that you are going to have enough time to study every week, otherwise you might not be able to cope. Overall, the whole experience has been very positive. Lessons are clear enough, tutors, mentors and support are great. The curriculum it's also good and the online model worked great for me as it provided me with the flexibility of doing my own thing from anywhere. Just make sure you are good at organising your own work. Expect to learn coding at a starting level, enough to potentially land a job or build your own projects. Also expect to learn how to learn faster and to be resourceful on finding your own solutions to problems. These skills are gold for anything in life, not only at a professional level.

4262,Code institute,2017-06-04,I completed the full-time course in full stack coding this year after deciding to change careers. Over 12 weeks you go from a novice to being able to create a full stack web app. The bootcamp is help in a classroom on St Stephen's Green which is very handy for transport links. Doing an intensive course like this requires a lot of work. There is prework before starting and I need to do an extra 10 hours a week or so outside class to reinforce the learning. Having previously worked as an engineer in the tech industry the team based environment of the classroom helped me learn and it also mimics how coding is done in businesses. The lecturers are developers so the emphasis is on creating apps rather than theory. The curriculum has been accredited by Napier University so there are clear learning outcomes for each of the 3 months. There is leeway however to submit projects that you want to build. This means you will come out of the course with a portfolio on Github/Heroku to show prospective employers. There is a hiring week where recruiters help to pitch your CV and employers come in looking for coders. If you don't mind a bit of hard work this is an excellent way to get proficiency on the current full stack technologies.,google

You also get taught how to push each version of your code to a GitHub repository which I found extremely useful. The support was great and there was never that long a wait for a response to my questions. I did the online course and I would say if you're doing the online one it requires you to have concentration snd self motivation and if you do feel stuck ever when doing the course, make sure you ask for help! One other thing that is nice, is that you are in a big forum with hundreds of other students that are all in the same boat as you.

However with all the support channels in place you have all the tools you need to be able to adapt and overcome the challenges you face entering into this course. In 3 weeks I was able to go from zero programming skills to being able to independently build a website from scratch using the technical knowledge gained from the course and the culture of independent problem solving it promotes.

4279,Code institute,2016-06-19,"I'm a student now but my experiences with this course are so bad that I feel an urge to warn people before investing their money in this course. I have completed only stream 1 covering Front End Development. Do you want to know how to make a nice responsive mobile navigation with a button to hide it? Do you want to know how to make a tooltip? Tabs? Popovers? Photo-slider with testimonials on it? The answer for 4500 euros? Add class to Bootstrap. Do you want to know how to make it yourself? How these things actually work? Too bad. I asked the director about it and he told me ""I don't want students to worry about the design, that is why we chose Bootstrap"". You know what their sell page says? LEARN HOW TO USE CSS3,..., TO DESIGN AND BUILD BEAUTIFUL RESPONSIVE WEB APPLICATIONS FOR ANY TYPE OF DESKTOP OR MOBILE DEVICE. You won't be taught to design anything, just add a class to Bootstrap. Is it an information worth 4500 euros? Don't you want to know how to design page elements yourself? No? Than this course is for you. I expected this course to have something extra considering the amount of money I paid. Project for the stream 1 This is what the assignment says: Use bootstrap or flexbox... I want to know how to design these page elements so I choose flex-box. I don't want to take any shortcuts in case I'm asked about these in a real job. There was nothing besides flexbox tutorial in the course content, that would help me to create these page elements. I expected jQuery lessons to teach me how to create these, but nothing besides exercises on how to change background-color was available. Thanks to my book ""Javascript and jQuery by John Ducket"", I've managed to create tabs and accordion. Also this book is ""practical examples"" based which helps to remember stuff. This course just teaches you the language. But so does Codecademy and bunch of other free courses. Is wrong from me to expect a little more for 4500 euros? Please use AngularJS as your framework. After I finished designing the layout of the page I started integrating Angular in my project. What happened to my tabs made with jQuery? My tutor told me that jQuery and Angular aren't a good match and is not recommended to use both in one project. Yet I was asked to include everything I've learned in the stream 1. I got a correct code but it does not work (I spend hours on it). I've send them an open letter mentioning a lack of concept even before I encountered this problem. This just proves it. They just glued lessons on different topics together without worrying about the big picture. Tutors Online tutors don't have a proper chat equipment. My last session was done over mobile phone microphone. I got myself one of the best available web cameras to get most out of the course. How come that people paid for it didn't? I've had three tutors already. The first one was from India. He was more than qualified to be my tutor, very impressive resume. But the reception was so bad I had to ask for replacement - his accent didn't help. I got an Irish tutor who just started doing web development. He helped me to set up the stream 1 project but other than that he struck my as inexperienced and even he had heads up, he wasn't prepared for our session. That was a point when I sent Code Institute an open letter mentioning all the problems I had with this course and I respectfully asked them to either give me my money back or hire me to help them improve the course. So I could actually do something about it not just whine about it. Won't give me my money back Neither happened. Brian O'Grady - Code Institute director told me that it's over 30 days, so they won't give me my money back. Because I completed stream 1 I tried to be fair and asked them for 2/3 of the money I paid. Instead he forced himself on me by saying he wants to help me. I'm basically extorted to stay.

4352,WBS coding school,2025-06-16,"When I started the Fullstack Web & App Development bootcamp, I already knew some HTML and CSS basics, and I had always been curious to dive deeper into coding. As a UX designer, I had previous experience creating apps and websites, but for a while now, I’ve wanted to get more hands-on with the actual development side of things. Let me start by saying: I’m incredibly proud of my final project. I honestly never imagined that I’d be able to build something like this in just a few weeks. The Fullstack Web & App Development Bootcamp is well structured, and everyone at WBS is friendly and supportive. Most of our instructors were relatively new, so they knew the curriculum very well, though they sometimes had to look things up when questions went beyond the course content. Still, they were always available and eager to help — I never felt like I was on my own. The pace is fast, and new topics come at you quickly, but with some self-organization, it's absolutely manageable. You'll learn a lot — and you might even get addicted to picking up something new every day! Most exercises are fun and rewarding. Sometimes the official documentation can be tough to navigate, so you’ll need to rely on other resources like Stack Overflow. But honestly, that’s exactly what real development work looks like. By the end of the bootcamp, you’ll know how and where to find answers — and in my opinion, that’s one of the most important skills a developer can have. You’ll also work on several group projects, which is great preparation for real-world teamwork. I had a fantastic time during the bootcamp and am now excited to keep learning and (hopefully) find a job in this field. One final note: don’t expect too much from the career days. They’re quite basic, and if you’ve applied to jobs before, you probably won’t learn anything new there.",google

I found the instructor particularly powerful; he was calm, motivating, and always supportive, without forcing anything on me. I was able to take away a great many tools and methods for my personal productivity. Added to that was a really pleasant, active community.

The community managers, the entire team and, fortunately, my course partners supported me from the start. I felt very well looked after, valued and looked after throughout the entire course. The course absolutely delivers what it promises - I couldn't have chosen a better bootcamp. The content is didactically excellently prepared (and I say that as someone who taught at a German university myself). The structure is designed in such a way that participants with different levels of prior knowledge are met where they are. Even without previous experience in data science, you can follow the course very well - provided you have a certain technical understanding and a good grasp of data. The teaching is a successful mix of well-founded theory and practical, project-related tasks that prepare students directly for work in companies. Anyone who feels overwhelmed will receive additional explanations and will be supported in a very small and empathetic manner when faced with technical challenges. If you feel underchallenged, you can always try bonus tasks. I found the WBS instructors to be excellently organized and very professionally competent in over 95% of cases. Questions are answered individually, understandably and with a lot of patience - even in larger groups. Another plus is the career advice, which makes it clear that this is a serious further training offer. Of course, no one can guarantee a job - the job market is currently very competitive - but the tips and tools you receive in the course are practical and valuable. I would particularly like to highlight two lecturers who impressed me with their didactic clarity and patience: Markus Hoffmann and especially Vasil Georgiev - thank you very much for your great work!

4364,WBS coding school,2025-04-04,"Disappointed by Misleading Advertising and Lack of Real Instruction I enrolled in the full-stack web development bootcamp at WBS Coding School with high expectations, based on the promotional materials that promised 396 hours of live, instructor-led instruction, personalized support, and the ability to tailor the learning experience. Unfortunately, my experience has been far from what was advertised. Here are the key issues I encountered: Live Instruction Time Severely Lacking: Although the schedule suggests several hours of live teaching per week, in reality, each session often includes only 30–50 minutes of instructor-led explanation, with the remaining time dedicated to self-study. This is not what was promised under “live, instructor-led sessions.” Self-Learning as the Default, Not the Supplement: While independent learning is important in any tech field, it was effectively the primary method here. Complex topics were introduced with minimal explanation, and students were left to navigate dense, confusing materials on their own. Disorganized and Inaccessible Learning Platform: The online platform was difficult to follow, poorly structured, and not inclusive for different learning styles. Despite raising this concern multiple times, no improvements or support were offered. No Real Customization or Personal Support: Promotional claims of personalized guidance were not reflected in my experience. Reaching out to instructors and staff with concerns yielded vague encouragements rather than real support or adaptation to my learning needs. No Accountability When Issues Were Raised: I submitted a formal complaint outlining all of the above. The school denied any wrongdoing and closed the complaint without offering a solution, despite extensive evidence. I’m sharing this review not out of frustration, but to help others make an informed decision. If you’re looking for a bootcamp with consistent live instruction, hands-on guidance, and clear learning pathways, I strongly recommend you explore other options.",google

First off, the two week primer is not just ""here is the material, learn it by yourself and we'll see you in two weeks"" but straight from the beginning it is with instructors, with proper schedule and all the support you could ever need. And that continued through the entire Bootcamp. It was of course challenging, as it is supposed to be, but the whole group of instructors and staff are there all the time and adjust to your personal needs to teach you. I am still surprised how much I managed to learn in this very short time.

4458,WBS coding school,2024-02-15,"WBS CODING SCHOOL // Data Science Bootcamp I participated in the 4-month-long Data Science Bootcamp. Overall, it was a great learning experience that solidified my Python knowledge, taught me SQL basics and a variety of data new data analysis techniques. - many teachers don't have tech industry background - no tight networking opportunities within the tech industry -Previous Knowledge- I have a PhD in marine science and had quite a bit of previous experience in statistical programming with R as well as a little bit of Python experience. Therefore, the first couple of weeks were rather slow for me. However, after roughly 4-5 weeks, the pace started picking up and I felt thoroughly challenged. -Curriculum- The curriculum is project-based and hands-on, which is the right way of learning for me. You start a new project every 1-3 weeks. There are live lectures and coding lessons. We covered basic data analysis and visualization with Python and SQL, Cloud computing and data pipelines, web scraping and API calls, A/B Testing, Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning (Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, etc.) and Recommender Systems. The only thing that was missing in the curriculum, in my opinion, was Deep Learning. The last 2.5 weeks are spent on a final project, either alone or in groups of 2-3 people. -Daily Learning- On a regular day, you would have some read-through material on the Online Learning Platform, followed by one or two lecture/coding sessions. The rest of the day is used for project work. By the end of the project, you usually present your work to the class. Students organize themselves during their projects. They can work together in Discord channels, or separately. They can use Github for collaborating or whichever other tool to facilitate exchange. How much you enjoy the learning journey depends a lot on your class mates and the group dynamic. -Campus Phase- Students can come to the WBS Campus to work on their final project (~1h South-East of Berlin Mitte). This has been the most fun part for me - I would recommend anyone to go if you have the chance. The bill is ~600,-€ for 11 nights of accommodation and 3 veggie meals per day. You can either pay it yourself or have it covered by the job center. -WBS Support- I've experienced the WBS CODING SCHOOL employees to be very helpful when it comes to organizing stuff. The job center had first declined my application for the campus phase. Together with the WBS staff, however, we were able to convince them to fund me. -Teachers' Expertise- The instructors I've had lessons with during the bootcamp were all knowledgable in the course material. They were also good at teaching and approachable, with some very few exceptions. However, they are certainly not all experts from the data science industry. The WBS website mislead me on this one, as many (perhaps most) instructors do in fact not have industry experience. That doesn't make them bad teachers, but it still put me off, as I'd expected industry expertise. -Career Opportunities- There is a Career Service that offers online learning material, three mandatory daily workshops throughout the bootcamp, a CV, CL and LinkedIn screening and a one-time career advice session. The workshops helped me a lot to brush up my profile. The only thing I'm missing is - again - a tighter connection to the industry. There are guest talks by people working in tech, but that's pretty much it. I would appreciate it if the final projects were presented not only to WBS peers, but also company representatives. This would encourage networking and job finding for graduates. Many thanks to the WBS CODING SCHOOL. Keep up the good work!",google

4479,WBS coding school,2024-01-15,"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the full stack web developer course. The course costs 10,000 euros, the content that the WBS Coding School offers is not nearly worth this price. It's more of a ""guided self-study"" in which you get your assignments in the morning and then independently upload them to external sites, such as. Codecademy (premium access costs around 25 euros per month). The “lessons” sometimes build on each other more, sometimes less. However, they are difficult to understand for a beginner due to their poor structure. The school’s own learning platform is not good. It contains errors, both in terms of content and language. The user interface (correct answers in the quiz are highlighted in red, for example) is confusing and poorly structured, just as the content is poorly structured. You're bombarded with an absurd amount of information in a short period of time, so you don't even have the opportunity to learn the important principles of programming. This is put into perspective with the sentence “We can’t teach you everything.” Certainly okay for those with code experience, but completely unsuitable for absolute beginners. When you criticize, nothing usually happens afterward, except for a few hackneyed phrases like ""you can do it!"" or it is claimed that someone is coming towards you and then nothing happens. I'm terribly disappointed and feel a little ripped off. The course didn't help me professionally. It just took time, nerves and money to be exactly where I was before.

I will review one by one the points that I like and why. Instructors: Our instructor Maria Piquero was amazing she has the patience, the knowledge and everything that is need it so you can understand and apply what its been taught. I have 0 complains tp her she is amazing how instructors and teacher should be in any place. Online: There is not a stopper at all for this Bootcamp to teach you online and improve, it is crazy how we all started and we ended up as professionals. Lessons: It is super dynamic and not boring at all, really well thought the design of the classes to make us learn with workshop so we can apply what was teach on the lesson. On campus: This is the highlight among all of it. All the people is nice, the stuff, the students, instructors and more. It is a priceless experience to go on campus so if you consider to take it, please go!, it is worth it. Good accommodations for you to stay, nice food with even chefs and with a beautiful view of a river in Berlin. You can not ask for more. Price: The price is fair for all that you got, even when you stay on campus it is cheaper that staying in a hotel in Berlin Work search help: They prepare you with your LinkedIn, how to do an interview, how to behave in job interviews, how to post to job and more. This part was the most scare I was of the Bootcamp but if you use every tool you definitely will get a job So overall there is not negative stuff to say, this is a good school for you to get into and I hope this helps.",google

Two weeks after graduating I received an offer from a well-known company. As for my background I started learning to code in 2018 in my free time. Despite my prior experience it still was a very challenging, eye-opening and rewarding experience and I learned a lot. Being self-taught I faced major issues hurting my success landing a: - lack of clarity what you need to know, - working in a team (big one) - foundational software engineering skills (think beyond web-dev plus escaping tutorial-hell) - career support I was able to get over all of them, it gave me a lot of clarity, passion and confidence on what's important to work in this industry. The technical knowledge (which is top notch) is only part of the puzzle here. You'll not only learn but embody foundational software engineering skills.

I would advise to learn to code on your own before joining because of the fast pace. I've seen colleagues struggling with frameworks because they didn't deeply understand the basics. Not because the basics are not explained, but because it is too fast to absorb everything. Nevertheless, it delivers what it promises: 5 weeks after graduation I got a job as a full stack developer. Two of my colleagues also got a job in that time frame. All of us had some previous experience in the industry. The support they give you after graduation to find the job is really good. They help you to tweek your CV to get more interviews and the do a weekly follow up to check what is working and what is not.

4573,Codeworks,2021-01-05,"I was a student at Codeworks between January and April 2021 at the Berlin Campus. I took the full 12-week Software Engineering course. I would highly recommend Codeworks to anybody who is interested in becoming a Developer. I signed up for the course as I was looking to start a career as a Developer and was impressed by the reviews I saw online. I can honestly say that it really did live up to what I was hoping for. 6 weeks after the course finished, I had multiple job offers from different companies in Berlin for Developer roles. I am now working as a Full Stack Developer with a great company and a great salary. The course is very fast paced and you definitely need to get yourself a bit of experience with coding and a general idea of what being a Developer entails. It is 12 hours a day for 6 days a week so you have to accept that you will not have any sort of social life for 3 months. You also very much get out of it what you put in, so you need to really concentrate and push yourself to learn new things very quickly. Some pros and cons of Codeworks... Pros: - The campus in Berlin is really nice with great facilities - The team in Berlin and the wider company are super friendly and helpful - The content and tech stack is very relevant in regards to what company and employers are using - Once you finish, you receive lifetime career support and guidance which is really helpful Cons: - It is expensive - The lectures are not given face-to-face, they are pre-recorded videos with Q&A sessions afterwards I would say that the pros definitely outweigh the cons, and if you are serious about becoming a Developer then it is a really great option. It's probably one of the smartest things I have ever done!",google

4591,Digital career institute,2024-01-15,"My Experience with DCI Was Horrible Contract Violations and Lack of Confidentiality DCI required students to sign a contract prohibiting discriminating, offensive, or inappropriate language. However, when violations occurred, the response was appalling. For example, when a student reported harassment, the teacher exposed the victim in front of the class, disregarding confidentiality. The reporting student received no protection and was instead targeted by a bully, who faced no consequences. Over time, those adhering to the contract were bullied, silenced, and humiliated, often during class. And I'm not talking about some little inappropriate joke. This is no case of cancel culture or being overly sensitive. Despite mandatory training on soft skills and diversity, DCI failed to embody these values, effectively supporting a toxic environment. Most companies would never accept this kind of behavior. Favoritism and Nepotism The teacher openly favored two students out of 15, and unsurprisingly, they were the only ones offered internships through DCI’s partner companies. The rest of us were abandoned, with no meaningful support from DCI’s job coach or management. It was clear that helping students succeed wasn’t a priority. Retaliation for Speaking Up Raising concerns with management only made things worse. Speaking out against harassment or other issues led to retaliation, creating a culture where silence was the safest option. The teacher ignored inappropriate behavior during classes and project presentations, further fostering a toxic environment. I've heard hateful comments and the teachers mostly just ignored it, saying we are adults. But then why won't the DCI enforce these rules? Students were expected to pretend that the diversity training was meaningful, even as DCI’s actions contradicted its own teachings. A Demoralized Class After six months, the teacher complained that no one but their favorite two students wanted to present exercises. Given the toxic environment, it was no surprise that students felt demoralized. Participating felt pointless when DCI showed no genuine interest in student well-being. Other students could simply belittle your presentation in front of the class and the teacher would move on as if nothing happened. The only reason it didn't escalate, was because the belittled students didn't respond to these comments. Fake Reviews on Google DCI’s Google rating plummeted to 3.6 stars but miraculously rebounded overnight with 50 suspicious reviews. Upon investigation, I recognized many names as DCI employees. It was clear they were burying legitimate negative reviews with fake positive ones. Some were reported and removed, but not enough to reflect the true experiences of students. Do not trust the high ratings—they may be fabricated by employees. My Personal Experience I joined DCI with strong qualifications and extensive IT industry experience, hoping to upskill. I was the only student in my class to secure a job immediately after the course—and I did it entirely without DCI’s help. The job coach was dismissive and unprofessional, blaming students for their struggles. She even refused to answer my direct messages, when I asked how to proceed since I found a job. It felt as if she was weirdly unhappy that I found an IT position without her. Final Verdict: Avoid DCI While some teachers are competent, DCI’s overall environment is toxic and unprofessional. The institution fails to support students, creating a demoralizing experience that undermines its credibility. Employers don’t trust DCI certifications for good reason—the organization fails to practice what it preaches. If DCI cannot uphold professionalism, how can it prepare students for the real world? Think carefully before enrolling. Unfortunately I fell for the fake reviews and didn't listen to the bad reviews.",google

Started with a blocked laptop, then they sent me another one, and then I was having problems also with that one regarding the updates and asked if the IT support could have a look at that, no support regarding that, they asked me if I wanted to switch laptop again and I said no, not taking another chance. I bought my own because my personal old laptop was already having problems. It didn't only happen with the laptops, but also with the teachers, they switched twice the teacher. The last teacher switch wasn't really necessary (with 6 weeks left to the end of the theory part) and it was super overwhelming for me. When you're used to a teacher, and the class already created like a family environment, you just can't switch it and disregard the learning experience of the students. It's just selfish. Also, the arguments are already complicated and then, you force your students to make a double efforts to finish the course.

Just wait until you get to the wonderful job search support program... - my class went through moments of despair (we all had to buy extra online courses because otherwise we wouldn't learn anything), until we literally had to shout in meetings in order to be heard and change something (which did change, but it was too late after 9 months of complaining). - After that, some teachers were good at teaching and were good people, nice and understanding and I'm really sorry they had to go through this mess of a school, but unfortunately even they can't make me give them more than one star.

4620,Digital career institute,2022-04-14,"I've done 2 courses at DCI over the years (Web Development and AWS re/start) and though I am thankful for the experience and information I have received from DCI. I believe DCI's approach to teaching could be drastically improved. I will start by saying that i believe DCI gave me a good foundational understanding of the subjects that i was then able to build on in my own time, but , in my Web Development course, i was expecting to get more than just a foundational education from DCI as the course was 12months. I think DCI could be improved by having: - a better student to teacher ratio (there are too many students per teacher) - providing teacher training sessions to their staff so they can format the information in a more digestible manor for the majority of students - hosting task review sessions straight after tasks are due to be submitted. I understand that learning via zoom comes with its challenges and benefits, but these challenges should not stop/excuse DCI from finding a way to produce high-quality results. I think these suggestions would have made learning with DCI a more enjoyable experience and improved our fundemental knowledge on the subjects. I also think that each student needs to be looked at by DCI as an individual student and not as ""just part of a class"", unfortunately, it is easier to detach and become less invested in a person when you are not physically close to them. but again, This is also a challenge to working and studying remotely, and a challenge that I am not sure DCI is committed to overcoming.",google

Webdev and online marketing were treated primarily and were TOP in this combination for me. However, some of my fellow students were a bit disappointed about the different weighting. The only point deducted is that I wanted a better division of the class between beginners (no digital knowledge) and advanced students (media designer or related professions). My consultation with Bogdan was fantastic and courteous. Even after being rejected by the office, he still tried to get me started. Unfortunately, it didn't work out for one of the annual courses because funding wasn't approved. Thanks for the great time to all the lecturers, especially Julia (OM), Wilhelmine and Max (Webdev)",google
4652,Digital career institute,2024-02-15,"At DCI I completed my second training in Salesforce Administration. I was looking for a course with an education voucher from the federal agency or job center and came across their online campaigns. The registration process to get an education voucher from the Federal Agency worked without any problems. The course ran from June 2024 to February 2025 as online training. After studying chemical engineering and an MBA many years ago, the Salesforce administrator training was a new challenge for me in the IT sector, in which I had no previous experience. So I was very tense at the beginning. The schedule of the course was good with a semester break of two weeks in the summer. The content of the course was adaptable for the famous Salesforce Administration exam. Two Salesforce projects enabled students to focus on key topics and experience lively business ideas. There were twenty-one members on the course from various disciplines. Despite high student participation, our course instructor, #RyanPlumridge, delivered stable and high performance. Despite his young age, Ryan was an experienced CRM expert. He had established good communication and appropriate authority over the students. He was very helpful to each student despite the different personal abilities. In my opinion #RyanPlumridge was a fundamental part of the course. I definitely feel grateful for his great work over the fourteen months. I also had the opportunity on Monday morning to focus on my language skills and improve my communication skills. On Monday afternoon we had the opportunity to get to know different perspectives of Salesforce with our mentor. From Tuesday to Friday the course continued with full classes and classwork from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. All courses that are funded with educational vouchers address the topic of career advice. What DCI does is inform students about career opportunities and improve their application processes. Unfortunately, there is no job placement for interns or jobs. It's probably the same for all courses. Although there were occasional problems with teachers and mentors, DCI was able to solve them quickly. This was particularly important for such a course to remain agile and react quickly. Many thanks to Klassen Management, #SelinaSchön, for her passionate commitment in these critical moments. On the other hand, the Alumni Talks, video conferences with experts from the IT industry, were eye-opening events for students to experience new perspectives. My special thanks to #RyanPlumridge for his excellent teaching throughout the course. I would also like to thank my mentors at DCI #HosseinNiko and #SiyandaNgage for their continued support. Finally, I would like to say that I can recommend the Digital Career Institute for further training in the IT sector.",google
4653,Digital career institute,2024-01-15,"I think all the 5 star reviews are fake. They don't reflect my experience at all. Or they come from people who took the basic course (which I thought was great too). The annual course was completely useless and only served to make a profit. I didn't have a well-trained teacher, his German was very poor and he therefore didn't have the linguistic skills to explain things properly or use different words so that everyone could understand. I saw teachers being reprimanded but I didn't fully understand the reasons behind it and a teacher in my class was suddenly fired. Students in my class then supported him because the termination was probably not carried out legally by the DCI. It's all really strange. I have my certificate but I can't really do much with it. The DCI is even said to have a bad reputation with companies. I regret having taken the annual course and wouldn't recommend the DCI to anyone I care about. Never! Go to another provider!",google

As a result, we have not only built up a sound basic knowledge, but also developed a better understanding of the big picture. You learn how important it is to work with other teams in marketing - and it helps enormously to know what your colleagues are dealing with.

4711,neuefische,2024-07-14,"I had an excellent experience with Neuefische's Data Bootcamp in 2022. The career transition the bootcamp enabled me changed my life for the better. Since then, many of my old coaches have resigned, presumably because their own staffing situation and work atmosphere have deteriorated significantly since acquiring another training provider. Three friends I recommended to the Neuefische bootcamp report the same experience: coaches who have no clue and only read from presentation slides, course participants who are thinking aloud about dropping out of the course because no one is addressing their concerns, and business clients who are dropping out and no longer see any need to hire half-baked bootcamp graduates into entry-level positions when their quality standards are barely distinguishable from all the self-learning career changers who acquire their specialist knowledge from tons of free offerings. In addition, all career coaching (revising CVs together, application training, job search advice, etc.) has been almost completely scrapped. I waited three months for the recruiting bonus for my first two recruits, and I think I was only fobbed off because I was really getting on the staff's nerves. I've been waiting for my third and definitely last recruiting bonus for a month now. No communication from new recruits. The admissions team is ghosting me. I'm just writing to them every day out of spite because I don't begrudge them keeping the recruiting bonus. I don't even need the recruiting bonus. I'll probably give it to the colleague I recruited as compensation. I find your current business practices simply awful and feel sorry for every poor, lost career changer hoping for a fresh start with you. You had something great and let it go to waste. That's just incredibly sad.",google

This part-time offer gave me the opportunity to continue working in my job (self-employed) and to look after my son. Nevertheless, the boot camp was a huge challenge for me, as a real career changer and at 59 years old. I have absolutely nothing to complain about the content of the web development boot camp, the form of delivery and the coaches. That was all very good. However, two things were difficult for me personally. On the one hand, half of the course participants were overqualified and already very experienced in using JavaScript and other tools. This performance gap can quickly lead to an inferiority complex and stress. Daily practice sessions with two other participants at my level helped me keep my frustration at bay. I can highly recommend it. On the other hand, time. The six months are packed with learning material, i.e. longer absences are not compatible with the boot camp format. If your children or parents become ill during this time and you have to take care of them, you have a serious problem. Such situations should definitely be considered or planned in advance. My conclusion: I can recommend a “new fish” boot camp. But - especially for real career changers - it is absolutely not a sure-fire success and requires perseverance.

There were a lot of doubts about even starting a boot camp: what is the quality, can you really be able to do something after 3 months and apply with it? So now I can say: absolutely! After three months, I built a cool and functional app, tried out a lot of technologies, and sent out a lot of applications. We had 2xCareer Sessions where we talked about CV, application process and salary. In addition, you can always book one-to-one sessions if you want to talk in detail about your CV, job position, doubts, etc. That helped me a lot. In general you could talk to every coach about one thing or another. We were all supported by you all the time. We were always asked for feedback and were always able to say what could be optimized and where in the process from our perspective. And yes, even though I've studied before, I found the boot camp tiring. My group were all motivated and hardworking. Otherwise we wouldn't have made it without that. It takes a certain amount of discipline to continue at the same pace, especially after the bot camp. After 1 month of intensive applications, I got my first job as a software developer!

First I was asked about my plans and I was allowed to tell everything in a relaxed and timeless manner about why I decided to make a career change. It has to be said that not everyone is cut out for an IT job (programming specifically). They tried to find out whether I was actually very interested in it! Since I had already started self-study months before to test my stamina, this was a great prerequisite for starting my studies. I was informed that I would be asked some questions in English, as some courses were only available in English and you wanted to make sure that you could follow them. (Logical right?). I was asked why I think teamwork is important and had to briefly explain myself in English. (I don't speak perfect English at all, but I understand a lot and can communicate) IT simply requires knowledge of English. Afterwards I was sent a programming task that I had a weekend to complete.

You're supposed to learn so much in such a short time? That would really be the starting salary after 3 months??? Yes, yes and yes again. Whether or how you succeed in the boot camp depends, of course, on your own commitment and motivation (e.g. avoid long evenings and weekends). The team spirit that you develop when you get involved is priceless. Apart from that, we had such a gifted coach who was able to impart his knowledge with calm and patience in such a way that you could always draw energy. It was an honor for me to be able to take this course! It was exactly what I was looking for for my lateral entry and the much more effective alternative to teaching yourself everything via tutorials (which are great preparations or add-ons). Even more important: Contrary to my fears, it wasn't a bulimic learning boot camp, but really sustainable through constant application (e.g. we had weekly coding challenges in which we reviewed what we had learned and worked on a task all day long). The boot camp is not to be taken lightly, you feel pretty much all the emotions there are, but definitely no boredom. Through LinkedIn, some have even received contract offers halfway through the boot camp! Overall, the organization and course design, including input from invited coaches, is simply recommended. And now to all the skeptics (like me at the beginning): relax. If you really want to do the boot camp and are interested in the topic, then contact the student service for further information.

4726,neuefische,2021-01-09,"Since I have also read ""difficult"" reviews here with unrealistic expectations of a bootcamp, I would like to describe my impression as a graduate of the web development bootcamp for those who are undecided: The boot camp at NeueFische is good! More than that, it's fun. The topics are wonderfully chosen, the coaches are keen and very approachable (patient, nice, talkative - etc., all of which makes learning socially pleasant), the classes are a very good size with 10-15 people and two coaches each, the career coaching is a beneficial support, especially towards the end (you can get the reverse recruiting experience) and overall there is good cooperation, an open ear for wishes and a good feedback culture. But there are no magicians on staff either: programming is not fun for everyone and therefore not for everyone. There should be a certain affinity, interest or wealth or desire to invest more energy. The boot camp can provide a fertile environment in which programmers grow many times faster than on their own, and the company contacts can ensure that coding bears fruit more quickly. In my opinion, this happens through the insight into the ""overall programming picture"", the coaching and ""ability to ask questions"", the internal group dynamics of the participants and the constant engagement with the topic. If you think it's enough to just run for 6-7 hours, three months isn't enough.q My tip for those who are undecided about WebDev courses: Visit FreeCodeCamp.org, do the full Responsive Web Design lessons and a bit of Javascript first. It works quite well and is fun? Well, call or write to all interesting boot camps: ask about the group size, coach-student ratio, ask about the topic content or the techniques/frameworks and compare. You might even want to look at the partner companies and talk to them about it. NeueFische was suitable for me, even remotely, and I am grateful for that. I was neither the best nor the worst, I didn't find it hard, but I did find it difficult and I actively tried to get a lot out of the three months. Last tip: Training like this is most successful when it is more intensive than a 9-5 job - so it's better to do it in winter rather than summer. This means you can repeat something after the course without risking death from FOMO.",google

Positive sides of the bootcamp: • How the group of students is carefully chosen. • Competent and helpful coaches • Clear structure: morning theory lectures, afternoon applications with coding • Variations between cooperative- and self-learning phases • Four long weeks for the graduation project. For most of us, that was the first time we worked so closely for so long with other colleagues on a project. • The professional connections made during the camp, with experienced data scientists and ex-bootcamp students. On the negative side, the notes/pdf-slides for the lectures need to be reviewed and improved. Also, after the bootcamp, you are still going to need to improve your skills in both sql and cloud technologies, as these are some of the most sought-after skills in the data-science job advertisements.

And I'm still impressed what I learned and achieved in this relatively short amount of time. If you are worried about if it is too much or you need to know a lot about statistics, as I was a bit: yes, it is a lot, and it definitely helps if you have a background in natural science or similar, like a field that uses statistical methods. Also it helps if you used UNIX before. And yes, the bootcamp is intense, but it can be done. You get a lot of support from the coaches, you just have to ask. They are super friendly and take the time to find solutions and are also willing to change the approach even during the bootcamp if you just let them know. For us, sometimes we felt a bit overwhelmed, but the learning by doing approach that is practiced during the course is good. Also, you have all of your fellow bootcamp students to talk to and (at least in my team) everyone was helpful and we had a great atmosphere.

As many have already written before me, the most appropriate adjective for these three months is probably “intensive”. It's incredible how much and how quickly you learn. The amount of knowledge you can absorb and implement in such a short time is really fascinating and it's all the better to be able to say afterwards: ""I did it!"" The lessons build on each other well and even if there are frustrating days, you are always picked up - by your classmates, by the coaches, by your own motivation. You share so much time together that after three months it's almost a bit strange and sad not to see the same faces all day. :) Of course, behind the successful concept there are also the appropriate coaches, without whom this great feeling would not happen - in Hamburg we had Jerry and Lene at the start for web development and this dream team sailed us through the time brilliantly - with specialist and insider knowledge, Sensitivity, motivation and, above all, constant interest in how we are doing, whether we have kept up and if it doesn't work out quite so quickly, a lot of effort to teach those who sometimes take a little longer new Implement what you have learned. Of course, a boot camp like this (which really deserves the name!) cannot be compared with a classic training course - but it is a solid basic building block. But you also have to really enjoy it and be prepared to have virtually no free time for three months. This secures a first step into your job life in the front end, but you don't have to go the rest of the way alone, even if there is of course a lot more independent learning to do now. But you also receive support and advice for job interviews and contacts with potential employers, which means that not only the “school time” itself is so valuable, but also everything surrounding it. Of course, the team is also worth mentioning - if all classmates are so interested in this type of further training, the concept works best, because last but not least, you also learn to work in a group and support each other. People grow together really well here and I really appreciated that the whole time! Finally, a few words about remote learning, because I wasn't in the mood for it before the boot camp - but after a short time I realized how well it works and how suitable it actually is. It worked perfectly for both learning and group work, as well as the communication surrounding it (a small study group in the evenings and on the weekends or conversations with Student Services) and I can't imagine learning any other way.",google

4751,neuefische,2021-03-31,"I did the Web Development Bootcamp in Cologne (almost) completely remotely and can absolutely recommend it. At the beginning I was skeptical as to whether remote would work so well... but it's no problem at all and probably even better than live lessons, as you can set up at home (e.g. second screen) and share the screen directly if you have questions so that everyone can hear and learn from error messages and problems. Digital tools such as Zoom and Slack are used ideally. The “Zoom concept” with the many breakout rooms, which you can use not only for group work but also after class or on the weekend for “unofficial” meetings, is mega :-) The learning content is perfectly coordinated. You are not overwhelmed with ppt slides, but rather learn from the beginning in practical projects and use the countless resources available on the Internet. This has the advantage that you can immediately understand how to distinguish the good from the bad online resources and how to understand and try out new software, for example based on the official documentation. Nothing different will be done in practice. The content builds on each other very well and at the end of the boot camp you suddenly notice “how everything makes sense”. It is always important that you become a “responsible” web developer, meaning that you understand the context and don’t just use frameworks/libraries. The coaches in Cologne (Leon and Philipp) are awesome. You know this from school or university - the subjects with the best teachers were the most fun and you learned the most. The two of them are extremely helpful, committed and personable, have an incredible wealth of experience and can teach it to even absolute beginners. It was not uncommon for the whole group to be completely exhausted and frustrated because they were overwhelmed and had the feeling that they no longer understood anything. The coaches always managed to move forward in small steps and infected us with their joy and motivation. Definitely one of the best teachers I've ever had :-) In the last month you have been working on a digital journeyman's piece in which you go through a complete project from the idea, planning, design to the development itself. This means that you then cumulatively apply all the content that you have previously learned and learn/consolidate an incredible amount in the process. A great thing and also practical for showing the new skills in action when applying for jobs. A big focus is also placed on the new fish community. Even after completing the course, you stay in touch via Slack etc. and can, for example, share interesting resources, exchange ideas about jobs, do code reviews for each other's own small projects or ask any other questions. Overall, an absolute recommendation if you are interested! The three months at Neuefische were a great time and I'm very happy I decided to do it :-)",google

You learn an incredible amount in a short time and of course there are ups and downs. One day you are completely desperate and the next day it suddenly clicks and the learning success is there. The team provides great support, regularly collects feedback and I also thought it was great that we were given advice on career topics.

I actually think it has a huge amount of advantages instead of disadvantages. Screen sharing made it possible to solve coding problems clearly in a group in a very short time. The social aspect wasn't neglected either, as we worked in groups every day and were able to learn with and from each other - usually there was even a group drink at the end of the week.

The great team spirit of the whole group motivates you to stay on the ball again and again and master the three months together.

I would give a point deduction for support when starting your career in the new industry. The two responsible employees seemed to me to be very focused on the Hamburg location and, apart from the two group coaching sessions on application topics included in the course program, there was little communication and support. However, I am not deducting any stars because the head coach made up for this gap and gave very valuable tips on technical interviews. Although I came from a completely different industry (social work/education), I managed to switch industries and can recommend the boot camp concept. However, you should be aware and willing to spend 3 months very committed and intensively learning complex content and getting involved in dealing with your own mistakes positively and letting others help you and helping others yourself.

The best part of the course was definitely the hands-on projects and assignments. They were tough but super rewarding. They didn't just teach us coding skills; they taught us how to work in teams and think on our feet. The resources they gave us were okay, but sometimes they left a lot to be desired. The material could be confusing and too simplified, so I often found myself doing extra research to really understand it. The sense of community at Spiced was amazing. We had regular social events like Friday beers and karaoke, which helped us bond as a group.

Week on week, we developed a portfolio of 10 projects plus our final project, which we worked on individually. The curriculum is Python-focused, spending only about a week on SQL even though it's a key skill in the job search. It covered many topics including machine learning (classification, regression, natural language processing, time series), data processing (NumPy, Pandas), data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Metabase dashboard), deep learning (recommender systems, image recognition), data pipelines (AWS S3, web scraping, APIs, MongoDB) and more. In a 12-week program, these topics are covered quickly so the course's documentation portal was a great online resource for reviewing topics, even after graduating. Career resources were good, covering basics like types of jobs, salary negotiation, CV writing etc. You have to take the initiative to set up one-on-one meetings with an assigned career advisor, which is a useful resource with specific input on your profile. Ultimately, relying on career services is not enough to result in a job. Networking, applying a lot, speaking with in-industry mentors via free external resources also needs to be part of the effort. Overall, an excellent foundation, but like every bootcamp it requires independent study afterwards (especially in SQL) to gain proficiency. Career services offer a good boost to get started, but you have to keep going and networking on your own.",google
4804,Spiced academy,2022-11-12,I had a really great Experience in the Data Science Bootcamp here. I had no prior technical experience and implemented a Data Analytics Platform at a startup by myself after the Bootcamp. I learned how to train Models and wrap an API around them before containerising everything and deploying it to the Amazon Cloud. Also the SQL Foundations have had a great impact on my career so far. I can recommend this course to everyone who is really motivated to understand Machine Learning and Data Driven Technology. I would recommend to make sure that you ask always when you don't understand something ( teachers will help you always) and watch YouTube videos in the evening so that you can keep up. But you are motivated you will do fine. Thanks to the great team especially Marija!,google
4805,Spiced academy,2022-11-11,I had a great experience at Spiced Academy. I found the contents and the study methodology very clear and also the great commitment of the trainers. They were always there to answer my questions. I would recommend the academy to anyone who is starting out in the world of programming.,google
4806,Spiced academy,2022-11-10,"A life-changing experience. From the lessons I learned during the course I started a learning path in this new world of Data Science. A year after finishing the course I still go back to the course material to continue reviewing and understanding more of the information I received, the references and pages recommended by time issues are not able to be seen during the course but it becomes a material that with the passage of time becomes even more valuable. The course was intensive and the teachers were always very well disposed to solve all my doubts, which in my case were not few. They have a very good knowledge of the subjects and above all an excellent relationship with the students. I strongly recommend taking a course like this and I invite you to open your eyes to this new and exciting world of Data Science.",google

4808,Spiced academy,2022-05-24,"I took the course in Web Development the beginning of 2021. Due to the pandemic it was fully remote. Nevertheless it was a fantastic experience! The teachers were incredibly friendly, supportive and proficient and the curriculum is excellent. The career training program is also a great addition and really helped me to find a job after finishing the course. Since I had been teaching myself to code for quite some time prior to the bootcamp, I was well prepared and found the pace just right. If you are planning to take the bootcamp, make sure to already have a strong foundation (or be willing to spend the nights to catch up).",google
4809,Spiced academy,2022-04-24,"Terrible experience. It's more a fast-paced no-frills topic review to check all boxes and say they ""covered them"" than a bootcamp to truly learn something new. Each class is with a random assistant so there isn't good continuation from topic to topic and the head isn't nice at all to students, even gets annoyed when people ask questions. Horrible learning environment. No one pays for the bootcamp, the German government pays so no one really cares if they learned. Only 2 people in my cohort found a relevant job and because they had previous experience. I made a huge mistake choosing this place. I now know their employees leave the positive stars here...",google

4813,Spiced academy,2018-11-16,"Attending SPICED Academy was one of the best decisions I have made. Since I was moving from the US to Berlin for this course, I did a substantial amount of research in order to find the right school for me and I ultimately chose SPICED. I applied in March 2018 to start in the October 2018 cohort and during that time I completed the prep course work several times to get a good grasp on the concepts. I joined the bootcamp as a complete beginner and once I finished the course, I was amazed at the incredible progress I made, how much I learned, and the applications I was able to build. The teachers are incredibly helpful and always willing to help you work through a problem but also ensure you understand why that problem occurred in the first place. That being said, this course is also incredibly demanding - it is a bootcamp after all! I spent an average of 10-12 hours every day at school for 6 days of the week. This is a fast-paced learning environment where you are challenged on a daily basis and expected to learn by doing. One of the first things I learned at SPICED was getting comfortable with certain parts of your application not working and how to patiently troubleshoot and work with your peers to figure things out together. This is all part of the learning process! There were times when I was incredibly frustrated and other times when I was overjoyed because I made something work on my own. In all, I absolutely recommend SPICED for anyone interested in making a commitment to learning programming. It was a gratifying experience that provided me with the skills necessary to apply to the workplace as a junior developer. You just have to be willing to put in the work in order to truly see progress in your abilities and get the most out of this course.",google
4814,Spiced academy,2019-11-15,Based on my experience I can tell you - if your goal is to get nice job as a developer then this bootcamp is for you. From this bootcamp you will get 3 most important things: 1. Self-confidence as a developer; 2. Up to date coding skills; 3. Your dream job.,google

4820,Stackfuel,2023-10-12,"On the premise of the 100% placement, they wasted my wife's 8 months and my whole family, including my 1 year old suffered a lot. No Placements, fake promises. Not only my wife, her whole batch is still strivig for a Job. The only team who benifitted with this course was StackFuel team, which made money. In response to your answer. 1. Yes Job Placement was promised and my wife tried to reach you people many times, they said sorry we cannot help you. 2. There was not a single time that my wife was given any link, any help or any interview was arranged. 3. My wife learnt all as per your course and she was one of the best in you batch and leave her alone, nobody out of the whole batch is placed, so you cannot singe my wife out for this reason. 5. My wife is P.hD from one of the best collges of the world and she got trapped with the promises you made, so from all aspects she is evry eleigible to get a job, but she was looking for a Knowledge upgrade and also that you guys will arrange Interviews so that it will help her finding a Job, forget about interviews, you did not even listen to her in terms of Job. 4.

After a written request to FINALLY leave me alone, Patrick U continued to bombard me with unwanted emails (he refuses to delete my data as required according to the GDPR, the lawyer already has an appointment with me, please) and suddenly calls me a woman in order to insult me. This person is out of control, no wonder they have to beg for students, no one wants to be picked on like that and then insulted after they can't help it. How anti-social does a person have to be to respond to an email where you demand deletion of your data according to the GDPR and explain how uncomfortable you feel and continue to be bombarded with spam emails? It's unbelievable that this person isn't ashamed! And inconsequentially writes another unnecessary, unasked-for, contentless email in which he explains that he no longer wants to use the data, but probably doesn't want to delete it. StackFuel / Patrick U probably say YES. Well, insults, harassment, coercive violations of the GDPR with intent can only be helped by a lawyer! That alone says it all about this company I don't think there is a company in the area like this one, so I advise everyone not to give them your data under any circumstances. They won't leave you alone and don't follow the law, they just become insulting. PLEASE FIND ONE OF THE HUNDRED OTHER COMPANIES.
