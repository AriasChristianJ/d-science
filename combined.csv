My journey with Le Wagon has been SO DISAPPOINTING that I feel the OBLIGATION to share my experience to prevent others from falling into the same trap. The SHOCKING news of the CANCELLATION of the bootcamp just five days before its scheduled start, due to only having two participants, marked the beginning of a series of OVERWHELMING problems.
During the registration process, I found myself dealing with MORE THAN SIX INDIVIDUALS, and to make matters worse, I had to REPEAT the application process two or three times. The INEFFICIENCY of their communication system between the branches in Spain and Germany is UNACCEPTABLE and has added an extra layer of FRUSTRATION.
In my struggle to obtain the GOVERNMENT VOUCHER, I faced more obstacles. The agent expressed DOUBTS about the RELIABILITY of Le Wagon, which only HEIGHTENED MY CONCERNS. The POSITIVE REVIEWS on their website do not reveal the DARK REALITY of the issues Le Wagon is facing. The LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM is evident, with people DISAPPEARING overnight, supposedly in ""VACATION MODE."" Additionally, they CHANGED the sales representative repeatedly during my process, causing CONFUSION and DISTRUST.
To add INSULT TO INJURY, the Data Analyst course, which costs a STAGGERING 8500 EUROS, left me QUESTIONING ITS VALUE. After READING and CONTACTING former students, it became apparent that completing the course doesn't necessarily leave you as prepared as you might believe. Moreover, the ACTUAL EMPLOYMENT RATE is not accurately reflected on the website, as the INTERVIEWER candidly revealed that many students either LEAVE the course or pursue it for PERSONAL ENRICHMENT rather than seeking employment in the field.
I made the PAINFUL DECISION not to continue with Le Wagon, losing TIME, MONEY, and even having to CUT SHORT my family vacation to attend this course. In summary, from START TO FINISH, my experience with Le Wagon has been a DISASTER. I cannot RECOMMEND this company to anyone and STRONGLY ADVISE reconsidering any plans to join them. A true NIGHTMARE that I deeply regret having lived through!",trustpilot,
2824,le wagon,"February 05, 2023","Having been a little hesitant to choose the remote web development course, I must say that from day 1 these preconceptions were washed away. The pre-bootcamp course material really helped to get your mindset ready. There were definitely big learning curves throughout the process but I think all bootcamps have this intense experience. The staff were really friendly and inclusive, really making everyone in my large batch (50 of us!) feel comfortable whilst also pushing us to get as much as we could out of the learning environment. By choosing Ruby and Rails, the course is very focussed around full-stack so bear that in mind - all concepts are fundamentals to get a job as a frontend or backend engineer. Would definitely recommend the process.",trustpilot,

2891,Careerfoundry,"February 20, 2025","The course was very intuitive and a really deep dive into technical topic. The team of mentors and tutors was always present and ready to assist you during the process.
I will not give five stars only because some of the content was slightly outdated but other than that, awesome experience",trustpilot,
2894,Careerfoundry,"January 30, 2024","Went through the Digital Marketing course in 2023 and while the costs were covered by the German government, it was ultimately fully a waste of time. I finished it, but it doesn't provide you with anything better than watching a youtube tutorial in the eyes of a potential employer. The field is highly competitive, and unless you can afford to work afterwords for free for years until you build an impressive enough portfolio, save your time and take a different route.",trustpilot,
2898,Careerfoundry,"February 28, 2024","Since joining the school, I have had constant support from my mentor, Luca, and my tutor, Elena. They are constantly working with me; it's like,e 24/7 because if I submit my work on weekends, I get constant replies. I am so happy. I hope I made the best decision to choose my career; I can now start my job because of the knowledge I have gained from them. Everything I needed, I got it. thank you for the knowledge in Tech.",trustpilot,
2899,Careerfoundry,"February 21, 2024","I am halfway through my Product Management course and I am very happy with my experience with Career Foundry. The course material is informative, but digestible, and the exercises allow you to put into practice what you've just learned. The CF team has solve all problems that have arisen quickly and everyone has been very helpful. I like that there is always someone who you can talk to and ask questions. I would recommend this course for anyone wanting to gain knowledge and expertise in a new field quickly.",trustpilot,
2900,Careerfoundry,"January 09, 2024","It was pretty challenging to find a course in a digital marketing field, where one can get enough practice and real-life tasks! During the course one gets super professional and helpful instructors, diverse projects and lots, lots of insights that you will never get by self learning. Beautiful portfolio & executive career advisory are the cherry üçí on pie. Thank you, Career Foundry! I really enjoyed this time.
Pros
A very comprehensive course, with no unnecessary theory Instructors are working in real industry and are very professional The school is highly appreciated by recruiters And much more...
Cons
Basically nothing. But the course is not for lazy people, as it's pretty challenging",trustpilot,
2907,Careerfoundry,"January 01, 2023","I'm a total career changer, so it's not always easy for me, but the CareerFoundry team is there to help and advise.
The course material is clearly structured, and with every little achievement, I feel a bit more confident.
The vibrant Slack community is worth its weight in gold!",trustpilot,
2908,Careerfoundry,"February 23, 2022","Although the course is super intense and demanding (and I honestly mean it), I consider it one of the best educational choices I have made. I tried some other UX courses in the past; however, they all missed one thing: STRUCTURE. 
The amount of support you receive in order to succeed is enormous, and I am saying this as a newbie in the field. I appreciate the information and the instructions delivered and the proficiency and friendliness of my tutor, mentor, and the entire CF community. I can honestly recommend it to anybody who wishes to change his professional path.",trustpilot,
2909,Careerfoundry,"February 21, 2022",Terrible experiences German service and Tutors terrible you can find better help in youtube fro free than the help the tutors here give the students terrible tutors not willing to help you complete the task they are very good in the enrolment stage but after you are enrolled you are just a number there nobody at CF will help you don't waste your time here,trustpilot,
2910,Careerfoundry,"February 05, 2022","Hey! I think that sometimes the course could be more practical, with more videos showing how to use some of the tools instead.
The instructors are very nice, their feedback is always helpful in many ways.
And even if the job assistance is good, it could be improved by having more direct contact with the supplier's support team to avoid any miscommunication.",trustpilot,
2911,Careerfoundry,"January 31, 2022","As a student with no background in web development & coding in general, I feel CareerFoundry is the best choice I ever made. The curriculum is very well organised, I was skeptical at first when I knew it was online but when I started the course I felt involved in the course more than ever, there's so much to learn and to practice that you don't feel the time pass by and you just want to finish one task and start another.  
My tutor and mentor are people who you look up to they are always there to help, give advices and guide me through my coding journey. 
The Student advisors are very welcoming and they always keep contact through encouraging emails. 
I encourage anyone who is interested in coding to take Full-Stack Web development course at CareerFoundry you won't regret it!",trustpilot,
3608,Digital career institute,"February 12, 2025","Before I continue with some of the things I think could use improving, I just want to say a big thank you to the teachers in my course, they really put an effort into teaching, and have proved nice people and trying always to do the best they could to help everybody who had asked for help with very big patience and offering different possibilities of solutions. The lectures were concise most of the times, and if they weren't, there was a considerable amount of good will on the teachers side to help clear the misunderstanding or unclear parts.
Also, having been surrounded by nice people and colleagues who were willing to help with code issues (here I especially mean two tutors and a few other colleagues) were strongest reasons for DCI earning that one star from me. 
I couldn't complain to my communication with the class management, although I know that some other colleagues weren't satisified at all when at times it seemed even the class managers could only shrug their shoulders after listening to our complaints because their hands seemed tied to address some of the issues (let's mention only not being able to record the lessons for later, which would have been a great help in learning).
Now, I will follow with a few complaints in order to justify why I wouldn't give more than one star and give some suggestions.  
On a general level, there seems to be a big discrepancy between how things about the courses are presented when advertising the course, and how they turn out when actually coming to the realization stage. 
The Orientation Course, at least the one being held in 2023. by my humble opinion didn't at all offer a fair representation of all the longer courses it should help attendees orientate towards. Namely, Python, Java, AWS, Salesforce were fit each in half a day or a day in the best case, which definitely couldn't be enough for someone to decide whether they would take any of these courses, at least not based on the experiences gained about these courses in the Orientation Course.
For instance, I was initially interested more in learning Python than Web Development, but as Python was underrepresented, I didn't dare to choose Python based on a one day experience.
As I did subsequently choose a one year Web Dev course, I could say that from today's perspective, had I encountered the JavaScript in the Orientation Course phase, I probably wouldn't have decided for Web Dev. As simple as that.
My suggestion would be to please significantly improve the structure of the orientation course to include more relevant information on all the courses offered. Also bear in mind that the Orientation Course should be more discriminative for attendees that might not be successful in the one year course. The goal of Orientation Course, along giving fair information about one year courses would also be to reduce the content related drop out rate in the one year courses, after the Bildungsgutschein by ArbeitsAmt has already been issued.
Continuing, I don't know about other courses, but my general complaint to DCI advertisement strategies is they should be leveled down to bear the reality check. If the situation on the market is tough, the advertising of the courses should be fit accordingly.
Namely, I suggest to put an up to date 1. feedback about different courses completion/dropout rates as well as 2. placement statistics separately for each course, especially after the finish of alumni period. 3. Also mention how many graduates have managed to land an internship, land a job after an internship, land an internship in the DCI partner companies, and  most importantly land a job after internships in DCI partner companies, as a certain control indicator of whether the courses are adequately tailored to the DCI partners needs or not.
The materials that we've learned in the one year Web Dev course are a good basis for further learning, but unfortunately not more than that. Therefore most of the colleagues in my course generation didn't stand a real chance even for the internship.
Hence, I would strongly suggest to please take down the 80% placement rate slogan, and rather update it monthly with relevant data across all the courses DCI offers, as mentioned above. 
My final and most important suggestion would be to work and arrange with your partners companies to assure a 100% internship for all the alumni that finish any of the DCI longer courses, and help support covering the adequate part of all the future students Bildungsgutscheins costs based on every successful candidate that any partner company decides to keep after successfully finishing the internship phase.
This would be the real proof of DCI programs tailored to their partners needs and a DCI that I'd consider giving more than only 1 star.

3610,Digital career institute,"February 01, 2024","Please trust the bad reviews. After the 12-month Web Dev course, this is my opinion:
- the teachers... confusing lessons, given by someone who knew nothing about what they were teaching.
- the curriculum isn't bad and could work if there was the slightest organization, preparation of materials and lessons.
- lack of support from class support (your complaints will either be ignored or answered too late).
- too many hours wasted on job coaches and soft skills classes.
- my class went through moments of despair (we all had to buy extra online courses because otherwise we wouldn't learn anything), until we literally had to shout in meetings in order to be heard and change something (which did change, but it was too late after 9 months of complaining).
- After that, some teachers were good at teaching and were good people, nice and understanding and I'm really sorry they had to go through this mess of a school, but unfortunately even they can't make me give them more than one star. I hope they find something better.",trustpilot,
3614,Digital career institute,"January 06, 2023","I did a 1year fullstack bootcamp at this online school
The teacher lack any teaching skills, and some of them struggle to explain some concepts in plain english
Also they don't encourage cooperation but more competition between students. If you don't get any concepts you'll be left behind and they will focus only on the few ones that they get it in the first place.  That was for me the worst. The teachers were calling all the time the same 2 or 3 names and not engaging the other ones in the conversation
The classes are overcrowded(20+) and the curricula is rushed. We had situations where even the teachers couldn't understand the assignments
Some of the people from the management agreed that their plans is to literally onboard as much people as possible. There's no filtering in the way they organize the classes. 
Quality is pretty low
Most of us couldn't make it without enrolling in courses on Udemy or other alike 
Considering the fact that you spend around 40h/week for one year for this, my time was mainly wasted by being forced to attend. I could've learned better programming skills on my own in this amount of time",trustpilot,
