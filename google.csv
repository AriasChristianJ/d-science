"Learning at IronHack was a life changing experience. I had the chance to meet amazing and inspiring humans besides learning high demand technologies! A shout out to our Web Development teacher that helped us within each project giving us precious tips and tricks about how to approach each problem. Once again, thank you so much.

"If you want a well structured course in Data Analytics, UX/UI, Web Dev and such this is really great option if not the absolute best. I finished in July and I am proud to be an Alumni of Ironhack. I went there not knowing how to code in Python properly, to being able to Use multiple libraries in python for various machine learning tasks. Of course I am not perfect and have a lot to learn but I have a lot of help to revise concepts I might have missed with the resources in the student portal that is helping me perfect my proficiency! Would definitely recommend.",16.10.2024,Ironhack,google
I'm really satisfied with my experience at Ironhack. I just finished the bootcamp in Data Analytics and I can only recommend. The teachers are great and very supportive. They also offer cool free events if you are want to know more about tech. ,15.09.2024,Ironhack,google
The Bootcamp on cyber security was very intense fun and stressful. Our Teacher Kevin was a master on taking as to a good path of learning. I did not like the Zoom sound Quality. As for the rest I found the content amazing the colleagues I found there they are still here in the heart and we still join to study. Sad that this Bootcamp is no longer 12 weeks as before. Without a doubt it was beneficial for my career. Best regards for the ones who join with me in the program. Will consider taking another bootcamp from them in the future.,18.08.2024,Ironhack,google
I completed the Web Development course (remote) in June and found it a valuable experience. The teacher was very knowledgeable and explained the complex content in an understandable way. Also the staff was very supportive. I highly recommend this bootcamp. ,20.08.2024,Ironhack,google
"I've finished UX/UI design partime here. I must say the course curriculum and the teaching methods of the school are awesome. You learn everything required to step into the industry even after the bootcamp there is carrer service time to time guiding you and preparing you for the job until the end. Specially you will have a wanderful campus even you will have space to learn by yourself. Instructor and the management team are also nice, whenever you need they will be beside you to guide you. I would like to recommend highly.",23.07.2024,Ironhack,google
"I did the Data Analytics bootcamp (in person) back in 2019 and landed a job one month after finishing the bootcamp in the area. I just did again the bootcamp (remote) now in 2024 and was again really happy with the experience. I love the fact that the bootcamp joins people from different backgrounds and experiences and you see everyone managing at the end. The curriculum is strong and well set for a great online experience without you getting lost. It's up to date with the market requirements and definitely represents an advantage against University, because we learn what the market is currently looking for (tech moves fast and things get outdated quickly). I think it's important to keep in mind that this is just a set of tools and it's up to you to use it wisely. You will have to push your limits and work hard and until late, but if you want to break through the tech market, this is a good entry point. I must say, the bootcamp is expensive for such a short and overwhelming experience. But you have lifetime access to the contents and recordings. I'm happy I did. ",17.07.2024,Ironhack,google

The entire experience felt like an absolute blessing; from day one, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming, making it feel like a second home. The curriculum, was incredibly challenging and teaching ‚Äîexactly what was needed. It wasn't just a learning experience.

"I finished a bootcamp in Data Analytics. In general, I was satisfied until the project week, which was a total disaster where no support was given whatsoever. I have a comparison with Le Wagon, where I did Data Science bootcamp, and they do it way better. So if you are wondering which school to choose, you have your answer :)",13.05.2024,Ironhack,google
"I studied UX/UI part-time at Ironhack. The experience was overall great, learned so many new things and met so many wonderful people. I am forever grateful to my teacher Natal√≠a Papadopo√∫lou and her assistant Gabor Gaya. As an individual with many questions they were always available and their support was remarkable. I am thankful for their efforts and continuous encouragement towards students. The bootcamp was def challenging and pushed us to give our best! The only thing I was slightly disappointed about was the lack of transparency from Ironhack regarding the job market for UX/UI. Perhaps this is just my opinion but I find that this niche is oversaturated and students have to strive for months perhaps over a year to land a job in the field. If so at all‚Ä¶ But overall it was great course with loads of valuable content and hands on learning!",07.09.2024,Ironhack,google

"My experience at Ironhack was truly enjoyable. I appreciated the exposure to the world of web development and received essential assistance and support throughout.

"Ironhack really sets a new standard in bootcamps. I m doing the Web Development Bootcamp at the moment. Just 3 weeks in (1 week prep, 2 weeks bootcamp) and must say I am astonished what I ve already learned and what I am able to code already (Done with Frontend, I m doing a 2D Game OOP project at the moment üò≤üòä, and honestly can t wait for the other two web app projects with backend, coming in the next 7 weeks). The teachers Omar and Aykut and teaching material in the Student Portal is very understanding and of good quality. One is provided with lots of resources on the way and Ironhack ensures a) their participants have a good understanding how life as a fullstack developer will be after the course b) everyone understands the learning material and is able to apply it. Besides that they have a great campus in Berlin! Very nice office rooms, well equipped kitchen, everything you need to stay the whole day and feel homy! Joyce, our Program manager together with the rest of the team plan beautiful events (the welcome event was so on point, and this week we gonna have a little Halloween Party üòç). Also the Ironhack Show at the end of the bootcamp where the cohorts Web Development, Data Analysis and UX/UI present their projects should be amazing, and I am very looking forward to it already today üòÅ in general I really love the fact, that the three bootcamps of web development, ux/ui and data analysis, take place at the same time. This way you can connect to many different people that are at the same point in life as you yourself: a career switch. Last but not least, I want to emphasis the whole admission process and career service Ironhack provide. The admission process was very smooth and Dirk, my admission manager was very responsive and helpful. He helped me making the right decisions, from online vs campus camp to starting point of the bootcamp. Besides that the whole bureaucratic process with Bildungsgutschein and co, was smoothly handled for me. The career service with Jes√∫s comprises a CV and LinkedIn Check, 1:1 career path meetings, workshops on how to present yourself on the job market as well as events with companies - and the latter even until 1 year after the bootcamp has ended!! I m really grateful for that and could not wish for any better support üôèüèº For me there is only left to say: THANK YOU Ironhack. I m more than happy to have joined üôåüèΩ For everyone considering Ironhack - don t hestiate!

"Data Analytics Campus - August 2023 The campus is located on the ring (Landsberger Allee) and can be reached in 5 minutes on foot. A) Intro First there is an interview to understand the intentions and goals together. If this meets the requirements, you will be invited to a technical test afterwards. 1 hour is given to complete 20-30 questions online. Once this part has been passed, the journey begins. However, before the course can officially begin, each participant must complete the ‚Äúprework‚Äù. This is first the setup for the computer and then the introduction to Python, SQL, statistics and Excel. Don't underestimate it, it's a lot of effort. However, this prepares you mentally for the official boot camp. A workload of 60 hours was given, I needed a lot more. It can vary depending on the type of learner. Overall I was satisfied. The portal where the exams for prework are queried is not my biggest friend. Partly because it's just not that user friendly for me and the tasks have been made much more difficult than in the preparation. B) Boot camp The course lasts 9 weeks and is followed by 3 more weeks of career coaching. From the first day you have to go full throttle. This means no breather at the beginning. The first week began on the first day with small programming tasks, which increased in difficulty on the following days. This automatically challenges your knowledge and problem-oriented thinking and repeats the material you learned from the previous days. So that at the end of the first week we had already written an entire code to escape from an escape room consisting of several rooms. And that in the first week. Of course, this quickly leads to frustration and helplessness, but it also brings the group together. This is all normal and part of the concept. And that was only the first week and so it continues at this pace and in depth. It covers Python, SQL, Tableau and Machine Learning. In addition, an exercise (lab) must be submitted every day in addition to a knowledge quiz at the end of the week. We had a great teacher who approached each of us with his emphatic manner, alongside his patience, understanding and the didactic principle of learning by example. You will learn an enormous amount in this short, manageable time. Looking back, I can't believe how quickly and how much mentally stronger I've grown. Always remember, the journey is the goal and with every step you get closer to it. C) At all times I had the feeling that I was in good hands. If there were problems, work was done to find a solution. Joyce (Program Manager) is your first point of contact. She and her team were always warm and accommodating. They also try to make everyone feel comfortable. How is this implemented, you ask? At the end of each week there will be a survey asking you to respond. The evaluation is evaluated and implemented in the best possible way. So Joyce was always very behind in case any of us had forgotten. There were also a lot of events organized over the 9 weeks to network and have some fun. Such a tiny bit of fun... My personal experience was great and I can only recommend it if you want to reposition yourself in this area.",19.06.2024,Ironhack,google

"My experience with the full-time UX/UI bootcamp, costing around ‚Ç¨8500 and ending in May 2023, had some noteworthy aspects: - Increased class size from 20 to 30 made presentations and Q&A sessions challenging. - The curriculum heavily relied on PowerPoint presentations, lacking interactivity. - The learning environment felt less professional than expected. - Strict guidelines seemed more appropriate for high school students than professionals. - Career preparation and guidance were insufficient, and interactions with industry experts were lacking. - Constructive feedback was inconsistent, and the cost-benefit ratio, considering the abundance of online resources, raised questions about the program's overall value. On the other hand, the Career Week proved to be a highly engaging and beneficial experience, featuring exceptional instructors and serving as a valuable asset in enhancing one's portfolio development.

Right from the initial contact with Dirk Gruhne, I was impressed by the level of professionalism and support I received. The information provided was thorough and helped me understand the program and the opportunities it offered. The application process itself was seamless and user-friendly. The instructions were clear, and I was guided through every step, making it easy to submit all the necessary documents and information. Any questions or concerns I had were promptly addressed by Dirk, which made me feel valued as an aspiring student. One of the standout aspects of my experience with Ironhack was the personalized support and guidance throughout the admission process. Dirk not only helped me understand the program's requirements but also took the time to discuss my goals and how Ironhack could help me achieve them. It was evident that Ironhack genuinely cares about the success of its students. ",23.10.2024,Ironhack,google
"Throughout the program, the facilitators and the management were always on their toes to help non tech people like me all the time. They always communicated through the portal efficiently and whenever a feedback was given - it was quickly reverted. In all the 9 weeks, the students from all the cohorts were helped and given ample support to go through the course efficiently. Last but not the least - the process from admission to graduation to polishing your profile for job market, Ironhack does it systematically .

"""I'm writing this for those who are unsure about whether to participate in this bootcamp or not. Just like you, I was in your shoes two to five months ago. I had doubts about whether Ironhack or any other bootcamp would be a good choice. However, after completing the bootcamp, I have to say that if you want to take part in this program, you have to rely on yourself. Don't rely solely on the teachers or staff. No one is going to do the work for you. I completed all my projects on my own, working alone. It's not that the teacher wasn't available; they were, but they couldn't dedicate equal time to everyone. I was lucky to be able to manage everything on my own, but you might not have the same experience. So, be careful. However, taking part in this bootcamp isn't a bad idea. You learn how to set up and push your limits, whether you receive support from the teacher or not. In this boot camp, I learned that I could learn everything on my own without a bootcamp. Putting yourself in a competitive environment is also beneficial. So, think again and, if you want, give it a shot. once again ***DONT rely on anyone if you wanna join the bootCamp rely on Yourself only ",27.08.2024,Ironhack,google

"I did the UX Design Bootcamp, full-time on site from Aug to Oct 2023. This bootcamp was very useful for me in team work, because I didn't have the opportunity while studying self-taught before. I had no experience in the field other than working alone and this experience has given me an idea of how things work in real life. I can say that the enrolment process is very fast and impressively easy, I have also been given advice and guidance with the bureaucratic issues of the employment agency here in Germany. My special thanks to Dirk Gruhne, who helped me with this. The course has enriched my networking by giving me access to a very valuable team of teachers and students to implement feedback in my work. I now have 30 colleagues in my network and a good basis to refer to. I can't think of many ways to improve a 9-week course. In a limited time, we have done 1 project every two weeks, it has been very intense.

"I was participating in the Ironhack UX/UI Design Bootcamp in Berlin from August to October 2023 and I can really recommend this training to everyone considering a career shift towards UX/UI design. It is very hands on, and I gained a lot of theoretical and practical knowledge in these 9 weeks. On a typical day we had lectures in the morning and project work in the afternoon. At the beginning, the projects were fictitious but towards the end we worked with real customers on their topics. From day 1, the design thinking method was used, and I can state that after running 5 projects with design thinking, I really see the value of this approach and feel proficient in using that method. My course (or cohort in Ironhack jargon) was pretty large and had slightly more than 30 students. It was a bit tight in the classroom but still manageable. Ironhack handled the educational challenge very well by assigning a lead teacher and two teaching assistants to our course which worked out to be very efficient. All three teachers were confident, skilled, highly motivated and always available to guide and help. We had really good mood from day 1 in the classroom and we grew together over time and I can state that true friendships developed in these 9 short and intense weeks. I also liked that Ironhack was organizing a weekly socializing event/party which could range from ‚Äúbeers in the park‚Äù over a joint breakfast or dinner to a karaoke night. I would like to thank the teaching team Max, Suzanne and Alicia for all their great teaching efforts, help and support.

"The UX/UI Design bootcamp website offered an extraordinary learning journey. In just nine weeks, I underwent a remarkable transformation from a business professional to a confident UX/UI designer. The instructors provided immense inspiration, guiding me through the complexity of design with patience and expertise. The entire team, from administration to coordination and program management, offered unwavering support at every step of the experience. Weekly check-ins added a personal touch, making me feel perfectly at home. The whole experience was amazing, Ironhack Berlin serves as a gateway to an exhilarating path of growth and creativity.

"I graduated in data analytics a month ago and my overall experience in the course was very good. I went into the bootcamp without knowing how to code and I have ended up with a good portfolio of projects that I can show to future companies. I highlight the teachers, because they were very knowledgeable about the subject and knew how to adapt to the pace of each person and their needs. The two missing stars I give them, one to the career service after the bootcamp, because it took me almost 3 weeks to answer my emails and they answered me only when I sent a reminder. The other star is for the facilities of the school, because in google there are some photos that are not entirely accurate, there is a photo of a terrace to which we never had access. hope this feedback will help to improve in the future.

For anyone interested in the Web Development Bootcamp: Great if you are looking to level up fast in life. The amount of knowledge learned is enourmous. What that also means is you will have to work hard. Like really hard. But difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations! My advice is to not assume the bootcamp is the ONLY thing you need for a job. There exists so much ever-changing technologies out there that you simply can not fit everything in one bootcamp. What you can assume though is that it will give you a strong foundation of knowledge and then you can use that to keep improving in any direction you want. Or not.

"I recently completed the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack Berlin and am absolutely thrilled with my experience. The bootcamp was intense and challenging, but it allowed me to learn practical skills in data analysis, statistical analysis and machine learning. The teaching team was excellent. The lecturers were highly qualified, committed and had a passion for imparting their knowledge. They made the lessons interesting and interactive and were always available to answer questions. The learning environment at Ironhack was great. There were many opportunities to work on group projects and gain practical experience. The facilities were modern and well-equipped and the entire team was friendly and supportive. I was also particularly impressed by Ironhack's career support program. They helped us optimize our LinkedIn profiles, work on interviews, and make contacts in the tech industry. I can highly recommend Ironhack Berlin‚Äôs Data Analytics Bootcamp.

The teacher was really good, able to explain complex concepts in a simple way and always happy to support the students. The teaching assistants (1 in class and 1 online) were very knowledgeable, and were very helpful for our labs and projects. It was also very good experience to study with other 17 students that were eager to learn and collaborate between all. It's a good space for learning and collaboration. The missing star is due to some administrative issues that were faced during the bootcamp, like keys not working well with the elevator, toilets out of service for a while, and the cleaning of the kitchen. I hope these issues will be solved in the future.",14.06.2023,Ironhack,google

"I enrolled in Ironhack this fall because three of my friends, who are now developers, had attended it before and were happy with their experience. The labs, lesson materials, and projects were great (though this is global Ironhack stuff, and not specifically to do with the Berlin location). But I was disappointed with the organisation as it was poor, with many unfulfilled promises. For example, the classes were supposed to have 20 students, but there were actually 30. There were no monitors. We had only one spontaneous interaction with an alumnus, but never with recruiters or anyone outside of Ironhack, despite their promises of external talks and success stories. Additionally, we never received keys to the campus, making it difficult to enter. Career support was lacking, with mostly ""just keep going"" type of advice. When I tried to book a 1-on-1 session with my online career coach, who is the only one for all of Berlin, I found that there were ""no openings at the moment,"" and this has been the case for two months. Lectures were not at all interactive and furthermore, the programming teachers (who were super nice) didn't have much experience with programming; they were mostly Ironhack graduates who were only able to teach what they had learned at Ironhack themselves. To make matters worse, our (or at least my) code was never reviewed, and we received no feedback on anything, including our final project. Based on my experience, I'm not sure if I would recommend Ironhack as I feel like I learned a lot, but I also had to put in a lot of effort and work on my own to do so. It's possible that Ironhack is better in other countries, but just not in Berlin or just not at the moment. So, my 3/5 stars are only for Ironhack Berlin.",28.05.2023,Ironhack,google

"Review about data analytics course. Extremely poor quality of both teaching and learning materials. One picture says a lot more than 1000 words, so I want to show you a picture* where on the left side we see the Ironhack's study materials, which cost more than $ 7500, and on the right side we see materials of another course for $ 200 a year. Pay attention to these scribbles, do you understand any of them? What about few months later, when you have already forgotten everything and you have a specific case for example you ask yourself how do I know what test should I use to test my hypothesis? Clearly we can see or more precisely we can't see structure in these scribbles! On the other hand, on the right we see teaching materials from another much cheaper course, which clearly and in a structured way helps us to ask the right questions such as how many populations I have, do I know population variance, and so on. and accordingly to choose the right test to test our hypotheses. Don't be fooled that they will help you find jobs, they didn't even check our CV, but left us to check it ourselves in ResumeWorded. I ask you, do you think that these scribbles really cost even more than $ 7,500?

"I am a business graduate and worked as a finance professional before entering Le Wagon. Tech-related work always interested me and I tried to pick up bits and pieces about coding, but never really had the perseverance and wholistic knowledge resources to really get started in tech. Building a website requires knowledge about so many programming languages, frameworks, and concepts that I was never really able to bring all the pieces together.
A friend of me told me about Le Wagon and the learning style seemed to be perfect for me. Le Wagon has an intranet with resources that help during and after the bootcamp. The bootcamp is built around this intranet and I learned how to solve technical issues with and without help from instructors. After the bootcamp, I was able to build complete websites with all sorts of functionality, design features, and user interactivity. As I started a data science degree program after the bootcamp, I benefited from the software development skills that the bootcamp provides to students. Now, I am not only confident in web development, but I can also transfer these skills to other software development-related fields. Our ""batch"" (that is the bunch of people that did the bootcamp with me at the same time in Berlin) was international to more than 50% and we spoke English 99% of the time. Everyone had a different background and almost everyone had a big career change coming up. After the bootcamp, I stayed in touch with many fellow students and we help each other looking for jobs and finding tech talent. I can recommend this bootcamp to anyone who wants to learn web development in a very short time. ",27.10.2019,le wagon,google
"As a philosophy student, I had a few creative ideas that I hope to develop, but was unable to due to my lack of technical skills. In 9 weeks, Le Wagon gave us an insight into what it's like to materialize an idea. The bootcamp is divided into two stages - the first stage consists of learning the basics of Ruby, Javascript, CSS, SQL, and other tools, and the second stage consists of applying what we‚Äôve learned to practice (i.e. develop websites using what‚Äôve learned!).
As an aspiring product manager/entrepreneur, the second stage was especially helpful since we learned how to pitch ideas, measure the feasibility of developing an idea in a limited amount of time, create user-journeys, design prototypes for website, and work as and with developers to create websites. We were constantly supported by hardworking and patient teaching assistants and other students despite all the mental struggles!
Also, I came to the bootcamp with a biased pre-conception that developers are antisocial; this presumption was totally reversed by the end of the first day! Everyone was very open-minded and social. Le Wagon also makes sure that we get the chance to know everyone in the bootcamp - each day, we are paired up with a new buddy with whom we cooperate to solve daily coding challenges. Personally, I consider this the best part of the bootcamp because I was not only able to cooperate with people from diverse backgrounds, but was also able to see how each person think differently by taking different approaches to solve a problem!
Le Wagon also organized quite a few career talks with product managers, entrepreneurs, and developers - I was able to gain perspectives on what I might be interested in doing after my studies by learning about work experiences of invited speakers, classmates, and alumni. This bootcamp in Berlin is really a wonderful experience and the highlight of my summer!",19.06.2019,le wagon,google

"Product Design Course Review I‚Äôm currently enrolled in the full-time Product Design course at CareerFoundry, and overall, it‚Äôs been a positive experience. I specifically chose this program for its flexible, self-paced structure, which lets me learn on my own schedule while staying on track with weekly assignments. The dashboard design breaks the material into small, manageable sections, helping me stay motivated without feeling overwhelmed. The hands-on projects are a great way to apply what you‚Äôre learning, and if you put yourself out there, you can build a student community for extra support.  That said, one area where I think CareerFoundry could improve is in offering more personal interaction with tutors. While weekly video calls with mentors are helpful, tutors‚Äîwho are more directly involved with your assignments‚Äîare only reachable via written feedback or chat messages. Having occasional video or phone calls with tutors could really enhance the learning experience and clarify feedback more effectively. Overall, it‚Äôs a well-structured program best suited for motivated, independent learners who appreciate flexibility but would benefit from a bit more real-time interaction.",10.05.2025,Careerfoundry,google

I'm more than halfway through my course now and am enjoying the process very much. The structure, the material, the tutors and mentors are all great, professional and they really do help you with detailed instructions feedback to get the most out of your studies and stay motivated. I've never done an online course before, but I can say that enjoy it very much and way more than I previously would have thought. The website and they way the course is built makes you feel motivated throughout, all excercises are very logical and explained in a way that is understandable to someone who is completely new to a topic, but also enjoyable to someone who already has knowledge about it. There are also always many links to articles or other material that helps you to immerse yourself even deeper in a topic that interests you. Overall I can only say good things about the course and CareerFoundry in general! And I am really happy that I can take this course and learn as much as I have so far. :) Regarding some other reviews here, I have found that the timeline and the amount of time it takes to complete each task is very clearly communicated from the beginning of the course and throughout. There is even an estimation for every single task that tells you how long you‚Äôll most likely need to complete each task. The full-time course as its name says is indeed full-time, however you can also choose the part time option which is manageable besides work. I personally really like that I can completely structure the time myself and can decide when I want to work on the course and for how long. I also can‚Äòt imagine someone being kicked out or not being able to reach anyone, my experience is that the CF team is always extremely easy to reach, quick to respond and very helpful regarding everything that I‚Äôve gotten in touch with them so far.

"I completed CareerFoundry‚Äôs UX program in March 2024. Despite applying to hundreds of roles and participating in their 6-month job guarantee, I have not secured employment nor even a single interview. Following the course, I sought advice from an experienced designer who reviewed my portfolio (which was initially approved by CareerFoundry mentors) and found it far below industry standards. When I requested a refund per the job guarantee, it was denied due to ‚Äúinsufficient documentation‚Äù and missed biweekly mentor meetings. Meeting this requirement was virtually impossible due to my full-time job, mentor cancellations, and delayed responses. Regarding the ‚Äúmissing‚Äù documentation, the requirements for tracking job applications were vague and unclear.

"CareerFoundry review I learned a lot. Great. But getting a job? No. I did everything possible to make myself look worthy of an entry-level job, even had to adjust my schedule just to talk to one of my mentors as required, because she literally never had time to talk‚Ä¶ funny how it‚Äôs her job she was never available for, but anyways, if you think that you can land a job without an actual college degree, think again. The world of UX is now so oversaturated with the masses of competition that you might as well be lost in a sea of fish spending hours looking for every job posting that becomes available. And, even if you do have a lot of experience and a certification, the person with a degree gets picked anyways. So, like me, you spend your money on attempts to avoid college, just to turn around and go back to college because a certification from CareerFoundry got you nowhere except a good baseline of how to do UX/UI work. It‚Äôs not completely their fault, but it‚Äôs the way the world works. If this does work for you, you either got lucky or know the right people. If you want to be a designer, just do college. At least then you‚Äôll have a degree to compete against and won‚Äôt be left with over 150 denial emails about how you don‚Äôt have a degree or don‚Äôt meet the requirements. The worst part of this all is that they have decided I don‚Äôt meet the requirements for a refund. Though, several of the reasons were because I didn‚Äôt have all the scheduled calls with my mentor even though she hardly ever had time available to meet, and the other reason being I didn‚Äôt have another project completed on my portfolio or land any interviews‚Ä¶ which I can‚Äôt really control if I don‚Äôt get any job opportunities. So I am not happy with the outcome. I at least would be leaving a better review if my hard work and time in this course was being refunded.",10.09.2024,Careerfoundry,google

"Not worth the one-star Please read other 1-star reviews very few get that dream job. I spoke to several grads; some are still looking and others have had to work for free and almost free for a year to get a job they want but for most, we are still looking and now need to pay for the loans we have taken. I took a course for UX/UI design I had an awesome tutor but the mentor was not great no feedback took my work and made it what she thought it should be. I passed the course and got more info than what I was getting on my own that was the only positive thing from my year-long ordeal I was trying to get a refund as I still do not have a job after 150+ Job applications and I found out today they never stated I needed screenshots of everything on the tracking sheet they provided so I will not be getting a refund I have no job as I had to quite the one I held in the middle of my course to complete the course. I had to pay 500 out of pocket for an extension and now I owe 10,000.00 due to interest and loan cost the kicker I have no job and have gotten no offer/Interview. I also noted that when applying for jobs, you can add a boot camp or certificates; they are not listed as a company but Google is. Career Foundry focuses on networking they rely on others to help you find a job that is the default they go to so if you are looking for a place to get a new career or boost your current one look at a university or check out Google bootcamp it has to be better than this one at least it is known in the US.",29.06.2024,Careerfoundry,google

The fist experience with was pretty positive, the structure of the Website and projects is also good and the mentors are professional but from different countries and even continents which make no sense specially in this field which regional market differences are remarkable. You will loose your access to the technical mentor as you finish the course and that means that if you need Support from them for your further projects in the middle of job search specially when your job search doesnt go well ( which is mostly the case at least in DA field ) you wont get it for free.

"Review of CareerFoundry UX Design Bootcamp I am currently enrolled in the UX Design Bootcamp at Career Foundry, and I must say it has been an enriching experience so far. Here's my detailed review: Pros: 1. Personalized Mentorship: The highlight of Career Foundry is the personalized mentorship. Having a dedicated mentor to discuss industry insights, career advice, soft skills, and receive feedback on my work has been invaluable. The 1-on-1 calls are 60 minutes long, and I appreciate how my mentor assesses my ""achievements"" (end of chapter tasks) within 48 hours, providing timely and constructive feedback. 2. Thorough Task Assessment: Another aspect I admire is the prompt and thorough assessment of tasks by the tutor. Within 24 hours, I receive detailed feedback on my assignments (tasks), which helps me understand my strengths and areas for improvement. 3. Structured Learning: The course material is excellently structured, leaving no room for the dreaded ""I don't know what I don't know"" feeling. The timeline provided allows me to track my progress and stay on top of the tasks I need to complete. 4. Engaging Community: The Slack channel is a fantastic resource. It offers various channels like study buddy, UX jokes, and general discussions. Here, I can connect with fellow students, tutors, and mentors for research help, feedback, motivation, and more. 5. Specialization and Job Preparation: The bootcamp offers a specialization course, which is a great way to dive deeper into a specific area of UX design. I'm also looking forward to the job preparation course, which I've heard great things about. It's reassuring to know that Career Foundry is committed to preparing students for the industry. 6. Job Guarantee and Support: The job guarantee provided by Career Foundry gives me confidence in the program. Knowing that they stand behind their curriculum and support students even after completion is reassuring. Cons: 1. Redundancy for Design Backgrounds: If you have a background in design, some courses might feel redundant. Coming from industrial design in aerospace engineering, I found a few topics repetitive. 2. Tasks for Beginners: Some tasks are geared towards absolute beginners, which can be less engaging for more advanced students. This is understandable since the bootcamp caters to a wide range of skill levels. 3. Limited Project Choices: The projects available for inclusion in the portfolio are limited to a few subjects. It would be beneficial to have more diverse project options to showcase different skills and interests. 4. Software Learning: Beware that you have to learn how to work in a design software mostly by yourself - before or during the bootcamp. While you can learn software like Figma during the program, it might be overwhelming for beginners. I personally learned Figma before joining, which made the bootcamp smoother. In conclusion, Career Foundry's UX Design Bootcamp offers excellent mentorship, structured learning, and a supportive community. While there are some drawbacks, such as redundancy for design backgrounds and limited project choices, the overall experience has been amazing. I look forward to completing the program and transitioning into a career in UX design with the skills and knowledge gained from Career Foundry. Highly recommended for anyone looking to enter the UX design field! ",06.01.2024,Careerfoundry,google
"The mentorship aspect of the bootcamp has truly stood out to me. Having a mentor who is not only knowledgeable but also genuinely invested in my growth has been a game-changer.

Pros A very comprehensive course, with no unnecessary theory Instructors are working in real industry and are very professional The school is highly appreciated by recruiters And much more... Cons Basically nothing. But the course is not for lazy people, as it's pretty challenging ",23.12.2023,Careerfoundry,google
"I regret that I took the Career Foundry course. I was hoping this course would help me change careers but unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt even able to get a single interview afterwards. There are not a lot of positions and all required experience with other technology I never learned. I also discovered I prefer using excel to coding but despite my coach having had luck finding a job like that, I never did. Part of it may have been the mass of tech layoffs around the time as some positions said that over a thousand people had applied to the same job as me. I also don‚Äôt live near a city and did not want to put my private contact information on a website (between data scraping and abusive people in my life I personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wise) which are both mandatory if you want a refund. My partner now continues to hold this expense over me as a mistake I made and now I am worse off financially for having tried to learn something new and improve my circumstances. I was desperate so I had hoped this would help but it didn‚Äôt. I would advise others to research the potential jobs you‚Äôre interested in thoroughly before signing up to see if this will help you qualify to apply, see if there are significant opportunities, and see if they are a good fit or not. Yes, I learned something new but I also found at times I was not able to have enough support when challenged and it was not worth it for the purpose of changing careers. I had one friend who did a bootcamp and had the same experience. I thought I would be different since I had a little experience on my own but I was not. ",22.12.2023,Careerfoundry,google
Great School where I learned about Data Analytics! ,20.12.2023,Careerfoundry,google
The service and course designed very nice. You walk through the needed topics in a good pace and nice details covered in each lesson. There are some gotchas like some features of the app is not in mobile version and some details not completely covered (e.g. conversion rate term was used in mobile first design lesson but not covered before) but as a whole everything arranged properly together ,15.12.2023,Careerfoundry,google
"Written in January 2024 Synopsis: only specific students can excel, potential money pit, out of date information I am currently working to complete the UX Design Program, and I have just about completed the UX Immersion course. Though I am not yet finished with the program, I would like to speak about my experience to give prospective students a heads-up prior to choosing CareerFoundry as their school of choice. 1. Self-Paced Program: If you are a self-motivated individual who can stay on task and stick to a schedule, you will probably be very successful with CareerFoundry. If, however, you struggle to set deadlines or stay true to the deadlines you have set, I would suggest finding an in-person bootcamp or program that has deadlines. I fall into the latter camp but fooled myself into thinking I could stay consistent which was a mistake. As a consequence, I have had to purchase a few extensions in order to finish the program. 2. Job Guarantee: CareerFoundry promises that if you are unable to find a job within 6 months of finishing a program that they will refund you your tuition. However, if you have to purchase any extensions to finish your program, it voids this guarantee, which they don't really tell you upfront.
3. TON of Reading: If you don't love to read or are a visual learner, this program may not be for you. The program is very text heavy and does not show many step-by-step tutorials.
4. Out-of-Date Material: A good majority of articles linked within lessons are out of date by several years. For a tech based program, I am surprised that these are not updated on a more regular basis. For example, they have the old version of Material Design linked in several lessons. Also, some of the linked articles on Medium have since been turned to premium articles that can only be accessed with a paid Medium membership. Overall, I often Google questions instead of reading the provided articles.
5. Tutors and Mentors: I have appreciated the help that my tutor and mentor have given me, but they often cannot provide immediate help. My tutor, Tasha, has given me good feedback on assignments, but I often feel like her responses are copy and pasted. And, I have had two mentors (first Alex then Steve) who have both given me good feedback on portfolio reviews but are only available through scheduled mentor calls. Overall, I often feel like I have a better chance of finding my answer on Google or YouTube than asking my tutor or mentor.
6. Design Software: Though you need to use design software to complete assignments, you are not given much direction as to which design software to use or how to use it. I ended up choosing Figma, and I purchased a Udemy course to figure out how to use it. I did try to learn Figma through their YouTube channel, but I found that it was not very comprehensive and it often assumed you already knew how to do certain things within Figma.
7. Community: Aside from the Slack community, there is no interaction with your peers. Considering that most design work is done collaboratively, it would be nice if this was worked into the curriculum to give students practice working in a team prior to entering the job field.
8. Tax Benefits: For students in the United States, be aware that you will not be able to claim an education credit on your taxes for tuition spending since CareerFoundry is based in Germany. Not a huge consideration, but I feel it is worth noting.

Looking back, I wish that I would have spent more time looking at programs and finding one that worked better with my learning style. I ultimately chose CareerFoundry because of the price, job guarantee, and self-paced nature allowing me to work around my busy schedule; however, if I had to do it over, I would probably go with a more expensive, hands-on program or even look into Bachelor's degree programs in Interaction Design (as it seems to give you a leg up in finding jobs and gives you more experience working in teams). In the end, I have spent more money, time, and effort than I had planned and am writing this review as a cautionary tale.",10.12.2023,Careerfoundry,google

"I don't have anything good to say about CareerFoundry's Web Development program. The Tutors are meant for day to day questions, and you can have as frequent as once a week meetings with your Mentor. CareerFoundry gets you by making the crash course super easy, and the first few lessons (after you've paid) start out easy to understand and gradually get way more complicated by the 5th lesson which is after their 14 day refund window.
When I asked the Tutor for any help I needed, they would just end up repeating the homework instructions and took hours to respond. The Mentor was the only one who actually helped me when I had questions but because I could only meet with them and hour a week I could only really get though one assignment a week. I even paid for two ""extensions"" to give myself more time with the Tutors and Mentor. Eventually with all the time waiting for responses and time spent banging my head against a wall, I tried to talk to the advisors and they refused a refund except for the two extensions, even though I didn't even have access to the more expansive portion of the course. That's $7500 down the drain. ",20.11.2023,Careerfoundry,google

"The worst, bordering on a scam. For a company that teaches coding, you would think they could code a countdown to your course due date on the dashboard. Despite advertising that they offer support from a mentor, tutor, and student advisors, the support is not there (or very much luck of the draw). My mentor gave little to no advice. My tutor actually accepted submissions that had coding errors; I had to go back to previous lessons and redo code that he should have brought to my attention when I submitted it. My student advisors gave the most generic answers, basically it was faster to research answers myself. Do not waste your time and money on this company.

"I have taken the web-development course over 8 months and I don¬¥t recommend it at all! The structure of the course is not well done and the content is too fast-paced! You are supposed to learn JavaScript within a few pages of text for example. Mostly you just learn through text! Texts and videos are partly outdated and do contain mistakes. Within the course you get to see few tutorial videos but from many different tutors which clearly shows that there is no consistency in this course. The tutors and mentors are nice and kind persons, however they just do the necessary things for you to pass the tasks, I guess they don¬¥t have much time. The tutor (which are being contact online via messages) surely work with copy/paste contents and links whenever they reply to you in a general way. I formed a WhatsApp group with around 10 alumnis that took the same course during the same period of time. Needless to say, that none of us have managed to find employment in that field. Companies mostly need people with a solid foundation and experience which is not given by CareerFoundry. The course content might be worth 200 USD + administration fee and tutoring/mentoring. I would not say it is worth more than 1500 USD. Over time they have also changed the course description, now it states that in ‚Äúpart-time‚Äù you need at least 20 hours per week, as I took the course I believe it were 15 hours. At some point of the course, one of the tasks is so difficult to understand and the content so badly taught, that the video tutor literally scrolls down slowly through the whole code for your to just write it down. They also have a PDF file for you to download with the code to paste into yours, that happened few times, to me it felt like ‚Äújust copy that code into yours and don¬¥t bother more as long as you pass‚Äù. So, what often happens to many students, is that you succeed with the course without really knowing what you do and without having an in-depth foundation into any of the taught programming languages! If I had known, I would have either taken an offline course, or a much cheaper course like from codecademy which are excellent and very well explained! If you really want to learn to code, book a good course or yearly subscription with Codecademy for e.g. learn the basics, practice, meet other people online or offline and build your portfolio. But to do all this you surely don¬¥t need CareerFoundry! You just need 1 subscription (codecademy), the willingness and motivation to learn and practice, practice, practice!

What I love the most is that I get so much motivation and inspiration from the fact that I am changing my life and career with every I exercise I submit. It makes me want to move on and do more and more to reach my goal in the end of the program (to find a job, of course ;).

"I had a terrible experience with their full stack web development program. There are much better programs out there that are more up to date on their materials and are less expensive. It seems like the only program of theirs that they care about maintaining and supporting is the UX program, but the coding program was unacceptable. Tutors that are either unavailable, don't care, or don't know how to explain coding, projects that are so out of date that all of them have broken within a few months of completing the program, and a program that makes you jump through absolutely ridiculous hoops to try to get a refund, which it doesn't seem like ever happens. This program was advertised to be able to complete in 8 months part-time, which is IMPOSSIBLE unless you have a very very low workload or job that doesn't require a lot from you. They also advertised that they have great tutors and mentors who support you throughout the program....I had 5 different tutors and 3 mentors due to the absolute lack of support from previous ones, and some of them being rude and insulting when you ask for help. This program talks the talk with how supportive and amazing it is, but absolutely does not walk the walk. And the fact that their projects are YEARS out of date is absolutely ridiculous. I wish I didn't spend thousands of dollars on this program, as well as be forced to pay $500 per month for extensions due to tutors being unavailable to help, projects being obscenely out of date, and it being near impossible to complete it in the given time frame. I would battle with CF for my money back, but it will never happen because at the end of the day, they don't care . Don't waste your time or money!! Updating to address the comment from CareerFoundry: The experience I had is not uncommon at all. Almost every student I have spoken with had an extremely unpleasant experience during this program, from materials being out of date to the mentor/tutor part of the experience being a huge frustration, it was not what we paid for. Not much time has passed since I completed this program and almost my entire portfolio of projects are deprecated or not supported anymore (aka broken). I have spoken with CareerFoundry about all of this multiple times and provided feedback regularly, but it does not seem to be a priority or concern to the company at all.

"I did the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp and it was definitely not worth the money. It's not a complete scam but FreeCodeCamp is way better and its free... instead of thousands of dollars. My tutor was really unhelpful and almost never could solve the issues I was running into while coding so I was basically on my own. You are essentially just reading from a text book. They are VERY few videos or tutorials to follow along. The curriculum goes from 1 to 100 and I felt as if topics were just briefly covered in the text, with very little opportunity to practice, and then you would be expected to just throw it all together in a big assignment with no access to video tutorials. With an unhelpful tutor, it was an infuriating nightmare and I just ended up going to freecodecamp and youtube to learn everything. Also note, the requirements for the ""CAREER GUARANTEE"" are very difficult to meet so if that is a reason you are considering the course, you should read the guidelines very carefully.",22.05.2023,Careerfoundry,google

"My Review of the CF program UI Design program offered by CareerFoundry Changing a career is one of the most challenging paths anyone can take, mainly because it's hard to find the first job. CareerFoundry promises everyone who completes their programs to find a job in a maximum of six months. Is that a real promise, and why should anyone think twice before enrolling in a program at CF? I completed in May 2022 the UI Design program offered by CF. I can talk only about my experience with the program and my experience with job search in this field in my country. The ""Job Guarantee"" to all participants was the main argument that convinced me to enroll in a UI Design program offered by CF. Other things that convinced me were the following: ‚Ä¢ The program is fully mentored, as well for the UI design as for job preparation ‚Ä¢ Anyone can enroll without having any relevant or previous experience in the field ‚Ä¢ The program contains a Job Preparation model, which is supposed to prepare you for finding a job. Despite these advantages that convinced me to enroll in a UI Design program by CF, there are far more disadvantages that must be considered. Namely: 1. Finding a job is culture related. For example, the job market in Germany is different from the USA or France from any other country. The job preparation module offered by CF doesn't prepare the students to find a job in the German market (although the company is based in Berlin). In addition, career specialists are not allocated to students depending on the country where they are looking for a job. For example, a career specialist from Greece has yet to learn how a student can find a job in Germany, especially having zero experience with the German job market. 2. The program curricula need to be updated, be regularly improved, as it's expected to be in tech domains. Consequently, students' portfolio projects made during the CF program must be more consistent to get a job interview with potential employees. Furthermore, the program needs to stress the importance of having a solid portfolio; instead, CF motivates only to get to the end of the course. 3. Even though everyone can enroll in the course without any previous experience in the design field, the UI design program by CF doesn't help you gain the basics of graphic design and UX design. Can anyone build a house without building first the foundation? The same principle applies here, to have a complete package of expertise or a foundation in the field, the students must also take additional courses or training programs afterward to fill gaps that the UI design program CF has. 4. UI design is a part of UX design. Learning UI design without knowing UX design is like building a house without any foundation. In Germany, these two fields are barely separated; if you want a job in UI design, you must know UX too! If you intend to enroll in the UI design program offered by CF, be prepared to take additional courses in UX design too! 5. The program is way too expensive and is not worth it. After enrolling, you will soon realize that any advantages that convinced you to enroll in the program are worth nothing by completing it. The chances of finding a job only with a UI design program by CF are zero percent. From my experience, after completing my certification in UI design and applying the best CF strategies to find a job, I've always got zero job interviews. 6. I started getting more job interviews just after I took a training program in Graphic Design and another program in UX Design.
To summarize, the UI Design program at CF is not worth the time and money.",19.05.2023,Careerfoundry,google

"Pros and Cons of enrolling in the Full-Stack Development program offered by CareerFoundry (CF). My Review of the CF program Pros 1. I had a very motivating and supportive tutor, mentor, and career specialist; 2. CF only issues non-credit certificates after completing the courses, but these are authorized by the ZFU (Staatliche Zentralstelle f√ºr Fernunterricht) ‚Äì Germany's state body for distance education. So no academic background is required to enroll in this program; 3. The alum community is friendly, large, collaborative, and international; 4. Once involved in the CF program, the tutor and the mentor assigned to you will help you create or improve your first portfolio projects; 5. The program includes a ""Job Preparation"" module which also includes online meetings with a career specialist for six months to prepare and support you in finding a job; 6. Includes a ""Job Guarantee"" program that supposedly guarantees that you will get a refund if you don't get any job within six months after completing the courses. Cons 1. The curriculum is not well structured and sometimes creates confusion, which inevitably leads to a delay in meeting the set deadlines for the tasks of each module; 2. The study material/curriculum needs to be updated; currently, it is at least 2-3 years out of date. Subsequently, this outdated curriculum prevents any alumni from finding a job, as most employers are looking for up-to-date employees with new technologies; 3. The program claims to teach you web programming languages from scratch without any prior programming knowledge; In reality, however, this program is intended for someone who already has at least the basic knowledge of programming languages. If I did not have an academic background in computer science, I would not have finished this program because the program does not focus on the basics of programming languages. So, if I were now a newbie looking to enroll in a Web Development program, I wouldn't choose CF; 4. After finishing the CF program, you will have to improve your knowledge and skills in the studied field by enrolling in other courses or programs that will help you learn and acquire new skills regarding the new technologies that have been developed in the last 2-3 years; 5. The cost of the CF program in its current state (with an outdated curriculum) is exaggerated; in my opinion, the current program shouldn't cost more than ‚Ç¨2000 - 2500; 6. The ""Job Guarantee"" program should be reviewed; I know many alums who have yet to find a job within 7-12 months (or more) of completing CF courses, but CF decided not to return anything, not a penny. Even though their ""Job Guarantee"" program says that everyone will get a refund if they don't get a job within six months of completing the CF courses.",10.05.2023,Careerfoundry,google

"I am so happy that out of all the choices of different web development programmes, courses and bootcamps, I have decided to enroll in CareerFoundry's Web Development course. I am now almost in the middle of the programme and can say that I really feel supported by the whole team and don't feel like it is an online programme at all. The curriculum is so well thought-through and the platform is well layed-out. You can really see all the hard work and diligence that goes into creating a programme like this. The support of your tutor and mentor is easily accessible and the team of student advisors is also always ready to help. What I particularly like is the tone in which the materials are written, while reading through them I feel like I am listening to a (very encouraging) lecture, like someone is talking to me, and not like I am reading a mere technical documentation.

"***DIGITAL MARKETING COURSE NOT WORTH THE MONEY*** I cannot recommend the Digital Marketing Course. 1. The way in which mentors and Tutors are divided is not optimal for students. Students do not really understand the roles of mentors and students. Mentors are responsible for marking tasks and providing feedback. But the course is structured in a way that DOES NOT assesses a students level of comprehension before allowing the students to move on complete tasks. Thus, students are expecting mentors to tutor them on. their tasks and mentors. Also, career foundry has a method of switching students from ONE TUTOR to the next or one MENTOR to the next. This method seems to be effective for career foundry, but is in effective for students as students need to wait to be assigned a new tutor or mentor and basically start from scratch in building a common understanding of the expectation that they have from tutors and mentors and vice versa.",15.04.2023,Careerfoundry,google
"I started the course very perfectly and was happy learning frontend and basics. When I started the Full Stack Immersion, my first mentor couldn't help me because he didn't know what he was talking about. It seems like he didn't know anything about javascript. It took a month for him to help me with a simple issue with one of the features of a simple project. My second mentor was better, but the material was poorly updated or explained. I had to book a call with my mentor to explain some materials, and since he was super busy, it took a week or more to get help each time. After all, one of the reasons that I got this course with CareerFoundry was the job guarantee. Basically, without any experience and a related university degree, there would be no chance of getting a job, and collecting the requirements for getting a refund is a full-time job itself. I DO NOT recommend this school/Bootcamp to anyone who doesn't have related experience or degree.

On the slack channels the same problems come up over and over again yet CF sees nothing wrong with the way they are going about things. They promise you the world and at the end of the day you are not much better off than when you started. You can teach yourself much more if you just take the free classes on youtube, or the much cheaper classes on UDEMY.

"This is a money grab. Do not waste your time or money falling for this trap. At first they assured me that absolutely no prior design experience is needed to succeed in the program and, consequently, land a job. This turned out to be false. They don‚Äôt actually attempt to teach you anything. For the first couple of months all I did was make keynote presentations and learned 0 relevant(design) skills. Then they suddenly expected me to use a number of different industry standard tools such as adobe illustrator, figma, and a number of other ones in order to complete my projects. When I reached out and asked for help with learning the tools necessary to succeed, they told me to go on YouTube and learn it there. This was really frustrating because I put a lot of money into this program and did not receive anything in return. My mentor was good and gave genuine advice but my tutor gave no constructive criticism and it seems like they just train the tutors to give compliments on students‚Äô tasks in order to boost their confidence, but it just comes off as disingenuous. Whatever information they dump on you can be found for free on YouTube/google etc. so just take the time and effort to learn it yourself because they don‚Äôt teach you anything anyways. Lastly, once I dropped the course after realizing it was BS, they completely ignored my feedback and stopped any communication once my money stopped going into their pockets.

"FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT The program itself has been amazing, a lot of things to learn and practice, lots of exercises and examples etc. What I would change is to strongly suggest to start some lectures about HTML and how the internet works (device requests, servers, HTTP, routing etc) because those three weeks given to finish that part could have been done in 10 days while, for example, Angular or React could have taken much much longer. The beginning is the fundamentals of the course, I would say the pillars of every web developer, so taken these lessons for granted could have meant saving time for a new learner, and investing it into more profitable things like React, React Native, Angular or mention of Vue. In the end, a future candidate is more likely to be asked these arguments rather than basic concepts.
Nevertheless, all the lessons and support material were great, my tutor (Blaise) was outstanding and my mentor (Nizar) was just amazing as a professional and personal approach.
I strongly suggest this course as an individual trying to change his/her career path or when looking for a practical approach into coding as a web developer. I had very little knowledge about what programming is but now I feel so much more confident and able to elaborate concepts that I could not imagine before. Be clear that it requires a lot of work because this course will give a big base to work on it, it's just the beginning of a never ending learning-path. A Bootcamp it's just like peeling a fruit...
Last but not least, when comparing this course to another one, not only one can say that the arguments included in the Bootcamp and wide enough to make it very interesting and complete but also taking it in 6 month full time is such a better choice than having some concepts in just a 12 weeks program, which in my opinion would not be long enough.
One more thing: for a German resident is possible to get a Bildungsgutschein, which means that the whole Bootcamp is paid by the government in order to be qualified and ready for the job market. Unbelievable!",30.04.2022,Careerfoundry,google

The mentors and tutors are there for you when you need them and you are able to build a great case study to add to your portfolio. ,29.04.2022,Careerfoundry,google
"The course is separated into two modules, Intro to UX and UX Immersion Course. I'm now almost through half of the UX Immersion Course and my experience is so far great! The two things I like the most are the flexibility to work on my own schedule, but of course respecting the deadlines, and the support from the tutor and mentor. Even though is an online course, you receive actual feedback and personalized mentoring. I truly recommend this course, especially if you are able to have your own schedule (without the need of someone always reminding you), can work by yourself, and can keep up with deadlines.",28.04.2022,Careerfoundry,google
"Edit: Olivia is the person writing those emails, not Julia. SCREENSHOT ATTACHED AS EVIDENCE Seeing most of the reviews I have to acknowledge great number of people benefitted from their COURSES, congrats and all the best. I'm currently having an ongoing marketing email long after I had unsubscribed from any form of communication with them. Nothing personal but I have found a different alternative and prefer not to be contacted anymore. Reached out and Julia I believe investigated the issue further and confirmed that my unsubscribe was affirmative since a while ago and ended up with the understanding I won't receive more marketing emails. However they did again on the 6th January. I marked them as spam and reported to Gmail, after which deleted the email. The persistent email isn't necessary guys, and it won't change my mind. If anything it gives poor reputation. Like someone said in the review sections, use an American company. Perhaps you'll pay a little more but your privacy will be super respected to the core. Customer service comes first in USA. CareerFoundry is an example of preaching to the choir where they can't fix basic communication issue while they show off themselves as IT training industry. I used other German products like IONOS for hosting and they'll always creep up on you with something unexpected or fight so hard to claim your right.

"I've just completed a 10-month part-time UX Design course with CareerFoundry and although it's been tough at times, all in all it's been a great learning experience and I'm glad I went through with it! The course itself is well-structured and quite hands-on. It's made up of smaller reading tasks which you have to directly put to practice in an exercise. I found this very engaging and it kept me learning and thinking about UX even when I wasn't working on the course material.",26.04.2022,Careerfoundry,google

From the beginning until now[I'm in the middle of the course] I always felt well taken care of, either by my Student Advisors, my Tutor especially and my Mentor as well as other Students within the Community.

"Absolutely awful course. Don't believe all the reviews. It seems very suspicious there have been so many good reviews. Please check out all the negative reviews first! The course is VERY outdated. There are long pieces of text to read (sadly hardly any video's - come on Careerfoundry - it's 2022!) The long, rambling texts have been translated poorly and incomprehensibly from German. The allocated times for tasks are ridiculous. To give an indication, they say certain tasks will take 6 hours - they will in fact take 35 hours. It's a two year course condensed poorly into 9 months. When inevitably you don't finish in time, you get charged a monthly fee for going over the allocated time. It's a complete money making enterprise. Be prepared to shell out a lot more money than the initial course fee. There are much, much better and cheaper courses out there. I feel like I wasted a year of my life with Careerfoundry. I have started two other courses - the Google UX course ¬£39 a month and LearnUI with Eric Kennedy. Both are excellent courses and I have already learnt more more in 2 months than I did in 12 months of Careerfoundry. Save yourself some money and pain and avoid this unethical company.

"I was recommended to CareerFoundry when I mentioned to a friend of mine that I wanted to change careers. Her friend had done this program, and after doing some research, I found this program to have the best qualities that I was looking for. I haven't completed the course yet, but I have been able to work with an industry professional (who I look up to greatly). She has been incredibly helpful in solidifying my designs as well as encouraging me to strive to create higher quality designs with each iteration and each project. I feel very comfortable with my tutor, who grades most of my assignments, as well. He's very kind yet instructive, and I feel like I am able to learn something new each time he reviews my assignments. He also has an abundance of resources that have been helping me along the way. I really appreciate the job course as well. I have only just started it, but I feel already like I am going to have the help that I need and the support that I want.

"My experience overall was great. I‚Äôve learned so much not only about UX, but the industry as a whole and my potential career path as a new designer on 2022. Learning The Tools: Although my experience was smooth and progressed in a good linear fashion, I can see how it may be slightly different for some others. For context, I came into the program with some prior knowledge about the various tools used to create the fancy phone mock-ups and animations. For a completely new person, there might be a learning curve as CF doesn‚Äôt go too in-depth on how these programs can be used. Advice For New Students: Essentially what I‚Äôm getting at is that, you have to do research outside of what CF actually teaches. Be proactive in expanding your learning on top of each section. The good thing is they provide many links in each task to expand your knowledge. And I highly recommend you read each one. And on top of that watch CF‚Äôs YouTube videos. Course Critique For CF: I don‚Äôt have many but the main one has to be with the example project within the course ‚ÄúFisherly‚Äù. It seemed very ‚Äúhalf done‚Äù. Each example deliverable didn‚Äôt seem like it would pass in a real world situation. Maybe it was purposefully simplified to not overwhelm students. But In my opinion, I want to see a seasoned designer genuinely go through the process of making a project that they actually put on their portfolio. Just so that I understand what a well done case study actually looks like, instead of having to find my own examples online. Overall: Don‚Äôt be afraid of this review, the positives I have for this course heavily out way the critiques. In all honesty the community and support system within CF are top tier and can make your experience 10x better if you‚Äôre proactive. ",13.04.2022,Careerfoundry,google

The curriculum is very well thought out and allows you to build upon your skills along the way, so many resources are given to you so you can really go above and beyond what is required. You also can confidently say you are a UX designer as those skills are braided will into the curriculum. I also love how flexible the program is, its self paced so you can move as fast as you want through the material and can take days off when needed.

My opinion is that the course material is the best you can get in this period of time, I mean 5-6 months, because I am learning full time.

I like the flexibility of the program as it is impossible for me to attend online classes at a fixed schedule. As well, the tutor that I had was very informative and share with me valuable resources to make my learning easier. The Job prep course was one the best things. In the past I had attended a couple of workshops back at university, but this course has an advisor that is almost a 100% committed to give you feedback and prepare you for the job market(this is not easy to find). Overall, the course doesn't cover all the material there is to learn about analytics, but there are always ways to complement that with what you can find online, so this is not a deal breaker for me. At the end, it was a good decision because I have accomplished close to 70% of the course and I have covered most of the fundamental topics required in a job. ",22.03.2022,Careerfoundry,google

"Currently on web development course (Achievement 4) and I'd like to post how I have felt thorough this course. 1, Mentor and Tutor system : So far so good, you can ask anytime about your questions and if you want face to face video call with mentor, you can book a phone call. However, my mentor call is always a week, most of the time two weeks ahead, so often I cannot ask what I want when I need it. My tutor is more flexible although he is only available on Slack or CF text message when you submit a task. It normally takes more than 24 hours and up to 48 hours to get an answer which is CF standard. 2, Student support : I really appreciate their support. Whenever I ask question, they reply immediately or sometimes one day. They are supportive and offer solution. 3, Achievement(tasks): In my personal opinion so far, it's not really good and unnecessary frustrating and sad because it's the most important part. I need another school which costs about EUR200/year to get an idea what's going on these CF lessons and it's much less frustrating and easier to understand than when I study with CF. Especially about React, almost everything is very confusing, lack of small exercises to build up/ solidify knowledge but just throwing information and codes, then task like if you don't know just ask your tutor which takes time. It just takes time, about Redux, first task is to create small code to see how it works which is good, then next one is ""apply Redux to user state"" like no practice but code about gathering movies and some hints about some function which I have never used. Sometimes it's very hard to understand only by text, it would've been better if there had been more pictures of how it works and small exercises to get an idea what's going on (not just ""play around with this code""). So overall I don't recommend this web development course for a several thousand euro. Thanks to my mentor, I managed to finish the course. Like I mentioned above, achievement 3 isn't good but it became better after this.
Also, I really appreciate job preparation course. It was really helpful to polish my LinkedIn profile and resume, applying job and making connection. I have no complaint. Overall, I recommend this course although I said I don't a few months ago. You just need to pass achievement 3.",20.03.2022,Careerfoundry,google

"--WEB DEVELOPMENT COURSE-- Until almost halfway through the program, the content is well structured and you can follow the program without much prior knowledge (even if there is better free content on sites like freecodecamp or codecademy). Unfortunately, once you have completed half of the course (and therefore lose any chance of a partial refund), the quality of the course materials deteriorates so much that you can no longer follow without relevant prior knowledge. The tutor and mentor do their best here, but unfortunately (due to the large number of students) they usually cannot take the time to really deal with the course participants' problems. Later in the job you have to teach yourself a lot, that much is clear, but if the learning process and how to get started cannot be explained to you and the mistakes you make can be pointed out to you in a useful way, you will quickly be lost. Contact with the student advisors is also not helpful here. After 4 weeks of various email contact, I can only say: the student advisors try to calm you down and say that the learning process has ups and downs. However, they couldn't and wouldn't comply with my request for additional explanations and support in finding a private tutor (even though I also live in Berlin - and an educational institution like CareerFoundry has access to hundreds of graduates who may be able to help you if you have difficulties small payment could help). But they weren't interested in that. I cannot recommend this course to anyone who is thinking about retraining or pursuing a new career path. There will come a point when you will be left to yourself and your fate. I'm actually a quick learner, but this course brings you to the brink of despair. I have pointed out several times in my emails to CareerFoundry that I don't like saying what I think of the course in this way, but that they should please help me make my experience better and not comment on the comment with ""sorry"" etc .

My only criticisms are that there have been some minor mistakes in the lessons and sometimes it takes longer than I would like to get in touch with my teachers. That said, CareerFoundry has always been accommodating with extra time to finish my course when there were technical problems out of my control.

"This design course was a fantastic experience! I'm a graphic design student with only my associates, but I opted to go with CareerFoundry rather than taking more classes for a bachelor's. I felt I could gain more experience in a shorter time for a lower cost. With that being said, here's my experience in detail: 1. The Information - To let you know right out the gate, it's a good amount of reading, and your experience will only be enhanced if you read the multitude of links and resources they provide. The information itself is a solid way to understand your design app, and the overall design process. It also helps to give insights on what you will be doing in the workplace which is a nice addition. I will say that aside from a couple of times, they never get too detailed on their topics. Each task will have you jumping around from topic to topic trying to learn everything you're reading, and depending on how fast you want to complete the course, it could be a lot to take in - but it's entirely worth it. 2. The tutor/mentor experience - My tutor has been wonderful. With rapid feedback, and giving real world expectations, I've been able to constantly be critiqued and judged based on whether a design is solid or lacking something. I think that the tutor itself is worth the money, because being able to have feedback from an experienced professional at the drop of a hat is incredibly important to growing as a designer. My mentor has also been a great way of learning about what I should expect in the workplace, learning about what and what not to say during interviews, talking about design trends, how they got their first job as a designer, and many more topics. 3. The price - I believe I payed around 6,500 USD, and I can confidently say, without even getting into the Job Preparation Course or the Specialization Course yet, that I would do it again in a heartbeat. I think that for everything you get, the price of a semester at a 4 year college is definitely worth the investment. You learn everything you need to jump into the workforce, and UI/UX designers make quite a bit more in comparison to graphic designers for example. Being able to pay that back after finding a position in a month or two, for up to 9 months of feedback, learning, and conversations with people in the industry? That's value! Overall I recommend CareerFoundry to anyone who wants to advance as a designer, or move into the design field from a different field entirely. You'll learn what the real advantages are when it comes to having a different skill set, and be excited even more about how you can use it to become an even better UI designer.",01.06.2021,Careerfoundry,google

It is helpful to know an average time, but has been a source of discouragement when I have needed to spend a lot of additional time on a project. Talking to my mentor has definitely help me set more realistic expectations and determine when I am being a perfectionist and just need to submit my assignment vs when I need to spend additional time working on something. That being said‚Äîit's clear that they are continually improving the course and completely open to student feedback. That's true UX!",01.03.2021,Careerfoundry,google
"The UX Design program at CareerFoundry has been incredible so far. It's self-paced which is super helpful, and the feedback is timely and always very productive. I have been pleased by my tutor and mentor's input and feel like I'm getting a quality education in the UX field. ",25.05.2021,Careerfoundry,google
"Overall I am extremely happy with choosing CareerFoundry. I enrolled in the UX Bootcamp in September 2020, and it took me a while to get used to taking an online course. Not easy to sit down and study on your own, right? What I liked about CareerFoundry was having a tutor and mentor to talk to. This was a huge asset for me. So, the first thing I did was that I started booking weekly video calls with my mentor to get a sense of how it is to be a UX designer. As a result, I got more engaged with the curriculum and finished my first project by October and got my Intro to UX certificate. The UX design program in CareerFoundry includes three sections:
¬∑ Intro to UX: you design an app from scratch with an overview of the user research, wireframing and prototyping
¬∑ Immersion: you will get a chance to design another app from scratch. This time you learn much more details
¬∑ Specialization: you will choose your specialization from existing courses and move further to become a professional UX designer
In addition to this, once you have passed half of the program, the job preparation course will be unlocked for you (if you are eligible for the course). In the job preparation course, you get a chance to work on your resume, cover letter, LinkedIn profile and creating your elevator pitch. You will have a professional career coach for this course too.
Moreover, you will be connected to other students and your peers on the CareerFoundry Slack channel. You can find a study buddy, get feedback on your project, get help from others, help them on their project, and share your thoughts and concerns for job applications later on. To sum it up, I felt very supported by CareeFoundry. It was like they were taking me step by step toward my new career by teaching me all the tips for being successful in finding my first job as a UX designer.",24.05.2021,Careerfoundry,google

"After 3 years in the entertainment industry, I felt out of touch with my self and my career choices. I began doing research on creative jobs in tech - a field I've always admired. CareerFoundry had a blog post comparing UX bootcamps, and humbly showcased other worthy options before selling themselves. After comparing a number of choices, it was obvious CareerFoundry truly cared about career-changers like me, who require hands on assistance, detailed course lessons, yet a flexible pace. I'm so happy with my decision to take CareerFoundry's UX Design Course, and can't wait to solve meaningful problems in my new career!",16.03.2021,Careerfoundry,google
"After making numerous comparisons on features, pricing, and payment methods, I decided upon CareerFoundry to start my UX design journey. I also need to add that the customer service rep who I was on a call with prior to registration was top notch and very helpful to allowing me to make an informed decision among the various options based in Toronto. Being someone who is switching career and with no design background whatsoever, CareerFoundry's student advisor, tutor, and mentor had been very helpful and encouraging. I realized that some of the topics may seem too bite size for people with some design background. However, the overall curriculum had been very helpful for my progress to becoming a UX designer. One thing that to keep in mind is that the curriculum offered at CareerFoundry is self-paced with occasional reminders from student advisor if you're off track. This is not something for those with a lack of self discipline or determination on making it as a UX designer. I have just started the job preparation course, so I cannot comment too much on the job assistance part but there is a job guarantee feature to the program (given that you stick to some of the requirements e.g. applying to 5 jobs each week after the design part of the program is done) I have just completed the UX Immersion course, and began the UI specialization! To wrap things up, I can definitely tell that I'm making tremendous progress and while the future does feel uncertain for a career switcher like myself, I do feel more confident in my abilities and more comfortable to call myself a designer.",20.04.2021,Careerfoundry,google

"Good reviews from YouTube led me to find CareerFoundry when I decided to make a career change amid COVID-19. I have to say that I'm impressed with their program. Even though it's online, which can be difficult at times as there is a huge learning curve, they have created an uplifting and supportive community (on Slack) where everybody wants to see everybody win. I've connected with different students all over the world and been partnered up with a mentor (one of the reasons I enrolled in CF) who answers any questions I may have about the industry and helps me with my projects. I definitely like the flexibility I have with this program (I work part-time) and I like how they take you through the process of UX design work where you actually learn while you're working on a project. The material itself is easy to read always followed up with a task to practice what you learned. UX design is cool work, very meticulous though. So if you have patience, a keen eye for detail and persistence, then this would be a good fit for you. Good luck! ",19.05.2021,Careerfoundry,google
"Really enjoyed doing their course. I liked the practical approach. Hands on, and make your own skills on Alexa. Also liked the fact that you can always ask your teacher for help and advice. What could be better: they tend to have somewhat older articles they refer to for extra reading. They do a really good job in supporting you and making sure nothing gets in your way to reach success. The way they have organized the course is great, you can immediately see your progress. ",18.05.2021,Careerfoundry,google
"Outdated, old-fashioned management style. An absurd policy of the company stands above the needs of students. This school is not for people who are searching for themselves, who want to experiment, try different things, and improve. Here you are asked to choose one project from only 4 options. Even if you immediately realize that you would like to change the project without starting anything and it wouldn't affect the work of either the mentor or the school or anyone else, you must not change anything. You are basically married to an unpleasant project for 7 months and forced to pay dearly for it. Such a model contradicts real life. All modern companies that care about the well-being of employees provide an opportunity to change responsibilities, departments, as well as universities allow to change the topics of bachelor's and master's thesis, because that's life and the human mind is not a stone, but a constantly changing entity. It must be allowed to change things if the new decision is in line with the aims and interests much better than the previous decision. I was simply shocked by the radical policy of this UX Bootcamp, so I asked only to stop my future payments, but since I have paid for this month, I was expecting to continue to read and copy my notes until the end of the month, but they just deleted my profile without any warning. In addition to this experience, I would also like to add that the platform itself is a bit outdated and not intuitive, full of bugs. Tutors are mostly young students who have just completed Carreerfoundry and never worked as UX designers.
I was promised high-level professionals who are carefully selected, but from the beginning, I got an inexperienced tutor, I saw clearly his experience in Linkedin, but for a whole week, I had to argue with Carreefoundry advisors because they continued to claim that everyone is a high-class professional, ignoring my comments and failing to acknowledge errors. After a week of stress, however, they changed teachers for me, but keep in mind that if you are not a fighter and you do not have the strength to fight for your rights, you can get non-professionals for which you will have to pay a large sum of money.",17.05.2021,Careerfoundry,google

"I‚Äôm currently enrolled in the UX Design course with Career Foundry. Prior to this I spoke to a friend who had also completed the course and overall had mainly positive things to say about it. I find the curriculum good - some of the tasks here and there feel somewhat pointless given the lack of ‚Äúreal world setting‚Äù and its more of a thought experiment in terms of ‚Äúimagine you‚Äôre on a larger team with different stakeholders‚Äù - but overall I‚Äôm quite happy with the new input and methodologies I‚Äôve been learning so far. As an already established professional with almost a decade of experience within creative industries under my belt, I decided to take this course as a means of upskilling. One thing I‚Äôd have to point out though is that CareerFoundry‚Äôs UX Design course many times seems more strongly geared towards recent college graduates or people very early on in their career path. While overall I do enjoy the experience, the UX course is perhaps a stronger fit for people wanting to start a UX Design career from a very entry level job. Not a bad thing at all - just something to be aware of in regards to managing ones own expectations! ",15.05.2021,Careerfoundry,google

"It's always a funny experience reading online reviews, but for what it's worth I gotta say I'm so happy I chose Career Foundry to guide me through the world of UX. At first, I was really apprehensive about enrolling in an online boot camp, I was worried I would feel anonymous and disconnected. As far as online programs go, I really feel supported. I have a great team of professionals (mentor, tutor & career specialist) who continuously encouraging and challenge me to become a better UX designer. In a sense, I feel more personally supported and guided than I did in college. My graduating class consisted of 84 people, so I feel like that says a lot about the quality of education Career Foundry will give you! Additionally, I'm impressed by how well the content is presented, there is a great balance between visuals and text, which really appeals to my kinesthetic learning preferences.

"I am very pleased with my experience with CareerFoundry so far. I was learning web development on my own before I decided to enroll, but now that I've made it near the end of the program, I know that there is no ways I would have made it to the level I am at now on my own. Their mentoring and feedback have been great and it is that human interaction that made me want to join their program. I have a tutor and mentor for web development as well as a mentor for career-preparation and they all have been incredibly helpful and have gone beyond what my expectations. With much information on the internet I knew that I could learn anything I wanted for free. The problem with that is it's difficult to know what information is worth learning and spending your time on. CareerFoundry's curriculum and mentoring have really kept me on the right path and I feel that I have learned much more efficiently than I would have if I was still trying to do this on my own. Compared to other bootcamps I researched, I felt that CareerFoundry had the best value and I really liked that they emphasized the mentoring and feedback because those have been most important to me. As someone who is 5 months into the program and getting close to the applying for jobs, I can say that I am very satisfied with my decision to enroll with CareerFoundry. I am proud of myself that I have invested the time and effort into their program and I feel very confident that what I'm learning will get my career started on the right foot.

"Posting under a pseudonym because career foundry appears to look up their negative reviewers and I am still enrolled. Please note that most positive reviews here come from people who work for careerfoundry. This tells you as much as you need to know about their professionalism.

The same tone is applied in feedback from ‚Äútutors‚Äù - it always sounds like it was generated by a self-help bot with no constructive suggestions whatsoever. I don‚Äôt feel like I am learning any tangible skills and the reading materials are very superficial. If you‚Äôre considering a career in UX, you‚Äôre better off watching YouTube videos, reading some medium articles and challenging yourself with projects.

"Hours of instruction: 853. That is a lot of time devoted singularly to one course of study. For me, pretty much every day over the last 6 months. One can't say it was just a superficial look into the world of UX. Though, from my studies, it's clear it is just the tip of the iceberg. I feel that the Career Foundry course and the exercises we were required to do have given me a good, real world foundation into the world of UX Design. An online course requires a large degree of self discipline (something I admittedly struggle with) but I was able to work through it and fall into a rhythm that helped me get through. The information provided seemed up to date and relevant to the real world and constant contact with my tutor and mentor (both current professionals) helped reinforce that. I found both of them to be top notch, always giving me precise feedback and suggestions on how I can improve my work. The student advisors were always helpful and provided quick responses (within 24 hours) to any organizational questions I had. Their Slack student community was also a plus, providing peer review, anecdotes and support when things got tough. It's also a great source of networking. Negatives? I suppose the online format can be a challenge as there is no instructor on a zoom call, for example. Lots of reading and tasks to perform every day. It can be a lot to juggle. I found the Career Foundry website and the messaging a bit wonky. Ironically hard to navigate and the tutors/mentors didn't always get our messages. I'll see once I start working in my new field if it was enough to get a foot in the door. Did I learn anything? I'd say so. I only knew this subject matter peripherally through my current job. It will be up to me to practice what I've learned through self-directed challenges so I can really absorb and internalize it. I would recommend this program as it is well organized and logically put together. Each exercise builds off of the knowledge you'd learned before and concepts are repeated so that you don't forget. Only time will tell if it is enough for me to transition into this new career.",27.05.2021,Careerfoundry,google

"Worst decision! I did find this course way overpriced for what it is and expected a more in-depth learning experience. Especially when I came in-person to show my old portfolio and asked how much this course will help develop my skill set and got the idea it will improve dramatically. Ok, so let's see what I got from Career Foundry for a few thousand euros: Most if not all of the information in the courses you can find online for free or for something around 30 euros in places like Udemi, so what you are paying for is the Feedback from the mentors and tutors, The biggest downside for me was not having any actual feedback frim my mentor for most of the course, I had to beg to change my first mentor after being unreachable when he kept just canceling calls that were scheduled for his timetable. I hope to have a mentor that will give me tips for improvement and not just say a ""Good Job, looks great"" even there are many ways to improve the project, and I ended up calling to my friends that are working in the field and asked for their help instead of the mentor. After sending 5 emails telling how bad my mentor situation was, I had to wait for my new mentor, I finally got my second mentor, she was really helpful and I finally got the help I wanted for my project, But on our first call she mentioned she gonna leave for a vacation in a few weeks. For the time she was missing I got another mentor that in one of the reviews (for a recipe app)just told me"" I like the app Green Chef I like the logo as its a chef and his color is a green, very good choice of colors.."", wow this feedback it's really helped me. The ""nice"" mentor was only available for a third of the course length. If one of the Career Foundry team members is reading this review, please go to my account history , if you can go and see any helpful feedback from the 2 other mentors I will be surprised. At the end of the course, I definitely didn't like the projects that I created and knew my portfolio is not good enough for getting hired. Now, a few months after the course has ended I made a few new projects that look much better (No support/feedback from CF, just from friends) I thought that Career Foundry will help me to get interviews, but 4 months after finishing the course and I only had 1 interview. I tried to get any job I could find. I spent over 4 months applying for UI/UX jobs and well nothing happened. Dear Career Foundry team, as you have a job guaranty promise for your students and I'm based in Berlin, I would like to get at least the opportunity to get an Interview, Internship or something to start my career...

"As someone who was changing careers after 20+ years, I was ready for a change. CareerFoundry gave me an amazing opportunity to do just that. From tutors, mentors, as well as the networking channels created for students, I always felt I received the support and guidance I needed. I was able to meet some of the most amazing and talented professionals along the way. I took UX Fundamentals, UX Immersion, UI Specialization, Frontend Development, and Voice User Interface Design - so definitely can speak on behalf of the quality of the programs! The job preparation course was extremely thorough as well. Most importantly, I landed my perfect job.

I am just finishing the UX Fundamentals Course. So far I like it very much. First I had some doubts because it is an online course and I have been prejudice but the learning system is great and I have already moved forward a lot! I also have a nice Tutor and Mentor!

"I'm a former childhood educator who recently switched to UX Design. I found CareerFoundry from a friend's recommendation, and have enjoyed the course, and found it challenging and interesting throughout. I'm currently at the mid-way point. I had no background in graphic design or any of the software, but have managed to stay on course, albeit slowly at times. My favorite part is the support staff, who are there to answer even the most basic questions, through instant chat or email messaging. A massive community of like-minded and supportive people around the world are at your fingertips whenever you might need inspiration or questions answered. Mentors guide your career goals and review your portfolio pieces. If you work near full time on it, you'll move through in under 6 months.

"I have already done the Web-developer course and currently I am working on the UX course. The insights helped me to understand many aspects these two professions. Even though I am full-time employed, the content and the tasks are manageable (if you have at least some kind of related knowledge). The Mentor and Tutors are helpful and have never turned down a question. ",10.06.2020,Careerfoundry,google
"As a full-time employee, I was pretty hesitant when looking at in-person and online bootcamps. What made me choose CareerFoundry was the flexibility of the program, the curriculum (you can tell it‚Äôs structured and written by professionals who know what they are doing) and the responsiveness of the staff. You feel like you belong to a team of people who genuinely want you to succeed, I have never seen them denying assistance to anyone, whatever the step they were in. Someone wrote that you can find most of the materials of the course online and for free ‚Äî it‚Äôs true, but I don‚Äôt think the material should be the reason why one enrolls at CF. You choose CF because you don‚Äôt want to take all the steps by yourself, because you want to be backed by a strong community and a tutor, and a mentor, who carefully review your tasks and make it easier for you to identify your areas of improvement. I know myself and I know I struggle to keep the motivation alive (especially when I have to study after a full work day) and I‚Äôm sure I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do all this if it wasn‚Äôt for Carlo and Sophie guiding me through the course, providing precious insights based on their hands-on experience in the field. For me, the real value of CF is ultimately the ‚Äúhuman‚Äù aspect. Don‚Äôt expect, though, that you won‚Äôt be doing research on your own and expand your knowledge on other resources. I strongly recommend deepening your UX knowledge on your own, based on your interests and your career plan: it‚Äôs an ever-evolving field so the sooner your start, the better, especially because some chapters are a great starting point but are not exhaustive in themselves. They give you the right direction, then it's up to you to carve your own path. Speaking strictly about the workload, I am pretty ahead of the milestones while working full-time, so the deadlines feel quite reasonable. I can‚Äôt say much about the job assistance because I have just started the job preparation course, but it looks up-to-date. I even started applying some of the knowledge I learned during these months in my current job and it‚Äôs very rewarding: I look forward to finishing the course and seeing what the future holds for me in this wonderful field.",09.06.2020,Careerfoundry,google

They even made me feel welcome at their office networking events, through which I met a lot of great people including current students.

I really enjoyed this course and that it offers the lectures in small chunks, while the work comes in small, doable tasks, but leads in the end to a good prototype that you can showcase in your portfolio. A lot of additional links are offered for more in depth reading and you'll have access to your course even when it is finished, so it's always possible to come back and re-read stuff.

I had no background in UX before starting the course and I now believe I have the required fundamentals to work in this field. It is intensive because every task requires focus and understanding within a short period of time, but I guess this is good practice to get a ""feel"" of the real world.

If I had uploaded the task a day earlier, even unfinished, there wouldn't be any problems. Those are their crazy rules.

"Having decided that UX sounded like something that I could get behind and focus on, I started searching for UX courses. There are so many courses available that I relied on reviews to seal the final decision, so I thought I should add my review as well. After reading reviews I went with CareerFoundry : UX Designer course. The main reason for choosing this was the reviews, and the job guarantee. Also their interface looked clear and the content really focused on the career changer. and that resonated with me. Decision made, I started the course in the summer of 2018 and managed to complete it by June/July 2019. The course is tough, it is time consuming and to keep up with deadlines certain other time sacrifices must be made. But I found the course fascinating and I felt really driven to finish the course so I managed to keep up with the progress indicators. The mentors are great (mine for UX was, Carlo Van Der Pluijim) , they challenge, support and keep you on the right track as you go along, tough but fair is how I would describe them. It's good that they pull you up on certain aspects of your work, as the whole point is to get you into a UX job, so you might as well do it right. As the course progresses you start working with a career advisor ( the one assigned to me was Richard Learthart). Richard helps you craft your previous skills into a great looking CV. His attention to detail and my work, definitely got me my first interview (and then job).These sessions and submissions are invaulable, probably best to start this half way through your UX course, it's more work but it gets you prepared for the next stage. Perhaps it was with luck, but also hard work and good support from the mentors and career advisors, I landed a great job (UX desginer) within the first month of finishing the course. I think location is key, be prepared to move if you are in a remote area. This course is very good, and it will equip you well for the career change. It's not easy, and it does fill your time, but it is well worth it. If UX interests you, then I recommend this course, highly.",20.05.2020,Careerfoundry,google

"I started the User Experience Designer course at CareerFoundry in February 2018, completed the course in October and got my first UX job in December. The course gave me the knowledge, experience and portfolio I needed to confidently apply for UX jobs.

The content and the structure of the course is excellent, broken down into manageable chunks to gain an in-depth knowledge of the UX process, the best part of the course is the support provided by the tutors, mentors and the course advisors. The course also provides support at every step of the job application process, I felt fully confident and ready when I started applying for jobs. I would like to specifically mention my tutor Matt Kollat, my mentor Pia Klancar and my career specialist Richard Learthart for being three of the most supportive and inspirational people I‚Äôve met.

The Job Prep Course: This course I took after the completion of my UXD course and I can really recommend it. It gives you useful advice and provides tools, not only on structuring your CV and cover letter, but also introspecting on your transferable skills and the broader picture of a job-hunt process.

The support from their mentors is a huge help, too. Never once during the entire course did I feel like I was alone, there was always somebody there to help. They also have a Slack channel with various groups so students can communicate, share feedback and work together on projects. I really felt (and still feel) like I was part of a community, and that made for a great learning experience.

"This review is for the Fullstack Web Dev course. The course is essentially one third HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery with the other two thirds being Ruby on Rails (building an E-commerce site specifically). The content is clear and well-explained and there are always links to further resources in case you want to go a step further and learn more on top of the core exercise material. I was always encouraged and motivated by my tutor whenever I handed in exercises. I didn't have much interaction with my mentor - only 3 or 4 Skype calls I think. I think he would have been available via PM if I had needed to contact him though. What sets the course apart from others is being able to interact with CF staff during and after the course, whether it be to get help with exercises or to ask for career advice. Being able to reach out to industry experts in this way is something that I've found very useful. On the otherhand, the information in the curriculum is nothing that you couldn't find online in other cheaper or free courses. That's not to say the content isn't good, just that there are a lot of great free or cheap resources out there to learn web dev at the moment.

Also the course prepared me on how to present my work and my creative processes to potential employers, which I think has been very useful. I also found very useful the active student community, I have got great help from it. For example, I got to know other fellow students who have ended up helping me a lot on my portfolio and job application documents and it has been a useful source to start networking.

"I‚Äôve completed the Level 5 diploma in full stack web development with Code Institute and completed 3 hackathons while studying with the course. Living in Wales, I was able to apply for government funding to cover the costs of the course and I‚Äôm aware there are other funding support options in different places. COMMUNITY: The support available at CI is exceptional - there is access to a community slack channel which also extends indefinitely after the course. Here there are many staff, students and alumni available to connect with for support and to boost morale - it is also well moderated by the CI staff so is a friendly environment and easy to keep updated with current events etc. CONTENT: The course content and structure is very comprehensive, although some of the later sections are heavy to complete with video and reading material, on the whole there is a good mix of learning resources. I would recommend that there are more options to break down the material / suit different learning styles - eg I found myself having to add video screenshots to my notes so I could follow the project tutorials better. The projects are well structured and were a great way to put into practice the skills you‚Äôve been learning. I was assigned a mentor to help with planning and keeping on track during the project which was also helpful. The assessment process is very thorough and does challenge you to fulfil all the criteria of a high standard web application - documentation, coding syntax, functionality and UX, testing, accessibility etc. The online tutor support is also brilliant when you‚Äôre stuck on sections of the course or fixing bugs in your projects. It can be intermittent during busy times, but the tutors were friendly and super helpful. HACKATHONS: I‚Äôve now attended 3 hackathons with CI, one of which was a hybrid event hosted in person by Google and Trust in SODA, London. A hackathon is run every month by a team of mostly volunteers, and it‚Äôs such a valuable experience for learning and collaborating on a coding project with a team. Particularly with the in person events, but for all hackathons too, they require a lot of coordination and dedication to run and so many people enjoy them and benefit from them - so thank you for all your efforts, it‚Äôs much appreciated!",19.01.2025,Code institute,google

"I highly recommend Code Institute as a Learning institution. Their updated Learning Modules are thorough and provide you with the foundation to get hired in Web Development. Their Slack Community is their best resource with Channel Leads and a Community Team to support you along the way. Their Student Care team is second to none and are there to assist you with any challenges you have along the way, even if it is just a pep talk to keep your mindset positive. Tutor Support is available to help you along the way if you get stuck on issues relating to the learning materials or projects. You are assigned a mentor that will assist you in planning and executing your Projects. You will have walk-through projects along the way that will result in a comprehensive portfolio to show recruiters and potential employers. The Careers Team is second to none! They provide weekly workshops regarding CV writing and hiring partner webinars. There is a Careers Module that you will have access to after you graduate. The bonus is: Code Institute is a part of the GitHub Student Developer Pack with free tools that would cost a considerable amount of money out of pocket. Code Institute is Neurodivergent friendly and assists neurodivergent students to succeed.
Monthly Hackathons provides experience and networking for students to further their skills in development. Code institute is University accredited. This allows students to enter the career market competitively, as well as pursue further education with accreditation. The slack community truly feels like family.

"It is a good course, I would recommend hands down because of the support you get, great community, hackathons every month, a lot of workshops and events but: it is an online course that you do from home so it has limitations. I feel that they cover a lot but very superficially, which is not necessarily bad because you get a taste of everything and on your own can go deeper in the knowledge (as EVERY developer has to do) but it is not great as some concepts are very important and should have been given more attention. I am lucky to have studied previously and that I have a senior developer as husband so I can cry for help very easily, but I often kept thinking about the ‚Äòless fortunate‚Äô. All the content can be found free on the internet (as everything related to tech nowadays) but they have an easy way of teaching, it is organized and you get to do projects that will be evaluated and you can get feedback on it. Another important aspect is that they provide university credited certificate, which can put you ahead of others (not always but sometimes).

The pacing of the course has some issues giving too much time for simple learning and then glossing over the final harder subjects. But the monthly organising of hackathons is what sets it apart as an educational institution. It allows you to practice things learned in a more real world environment with peers, they build your portfolio and experience and are what you would be much more likely to talk about in an interview rather than the course itself.

"Well structured and I learned a lot. This course has given me the knowledge to learn any fullstack framework as I now have foundational we knowledge. There are a few aspects of the course which I think could do with some changes. First of all the assessment grading policy, I feel, is very harsh and discourages spending a lot of time on each project. This is because if every area of your project is distinction level but there is one area which is pass level, you will be given a pass which I feel is unfair. Perhaps the grading should instead be a score /100 instead of the 3 grade bands. Also some lectures were not up to date and I spent a lot of time researching errors from installing packages which the lecture told me to install. ",30.12.2024,Code institute,google

"Participating in the Code Institute December 2024 Hack the Holidays Hackathon was an absolutely incredible experience from start to finish. The event was well-organized, engaging, and truly captured the spirit of creativity and community. One of the standout aspects of the Hackathon was the theme flexibility. While many teams opted for traditional Christmas-themed projects, our team, The Frostbytes, felt empowered to think outside the box. This freedom allowed us to develop our award-winning project, Discover Diwali, which not only introduced a lesser-known holiday to a broader audience but also championed the values of diversity and inclusion. The support from the organizers and facilitators was exceptional. From quick responses to questions, to helpful check-ins, they made sure every participant felt heard and supported throughout the event. The clear structure of the Hackathon, including daily standups, guidance on the judging criteria, and reminders of key deadlines, kept us focused and motivated. Special mention goes to the judging process. It was clear, transparent, and rooted in specific, meaningful criteria, which made every team‚Äôs efforts feel recognized. We appreciated how the criteria emphasized not just functionality, but also creativity, inclusivity, and user experience. It was this focus on storytelling, accessibility, and engagement that ultimately drove the success of our project. Finally, the sense of community and camaraderie in this Hackathon was unlike anything I‚Äôve experienced before. Collaborating with teammates from different time zones and diverse skill sets taught us new technical skills, while also enhancing our teamwork and agile planning abilities. Tools like Kanban, Canvas, and GitHub were integrated into the workflow seamlessly, and the experience felt much like a real-world project. If you‚Äôre considering participating in a Code Institute Hackathon ‚Äî do it! You‚Äôll walk away with new skills, new friends, and maybe even a shiny first-place trophy like we did.

I recently participated in my second hackathon with CodeInstitute.

Precisely because of that, though, it's always an excellent opportunity for hands-on real-world work, putting theory into practice which massively accelerates & extends learning and progress. Although disappointed not to have achieved a podium place with the team I helped represent on this occasion, reflecting with the benefit of hindsight has enabled me to recognise where there were likely areas for improvement in future, as a team AND by myself, individually! That in turn has triggered a lightbulb moment for me which has greatly assisted in 'glueing together' several of the modules I've already covered through the weekly&monthly structured online self-paced learning course leading towards my L3 Diploma.

"This course was quite disappointing, especially considering the cost of $6,000. Initially, the sales team assured me that there were no exams, only project-based assessments. However, these projects are graded, effectively serving as exams, and the final certification reflects the grades obtained. Another significant issue is the course structure. It lacks instructional videos for each section, relying heavily on text with minimal examples or images. The challenges provided are overly simplistic, offering little practical application, which makes it challenging to stay engaged and requires extra effort to maintain focus.

"Signed up for the Full Stack Diploma Course and basically feel like this company stole my money. Several parts of the course are out of date - many of the parts had not been updated since 2019 from looking at the code - and they simply say ""it is up to the student to keep up to date on trends in the industry"". Mentors are not available 24/5 and on weekends as they claim - most of the mentors have main jobs and their Code institute thing is a side gig and so are not available as readily as they claim. My mentor was from Nigeria (a very smart and nice dude who worked full time) but I suspect this is another profitability measure. Many of them also have little professional experience but are graduates of the course - they claim this is ""by design"". Whenever communicating with the Student Care Team, you would receive a generic Copy & Paste response and one of the favourite things is ""consult the Stack Community"". Stack is this poor man's reddit that they have which is, frankly, an absolute mess and you can never find anything on it. On the basis of all of the issues I encountered with the company and course, I asked to be de-registered from the course and have my money refunded but they constantly delayed replying to this - the head of the Student Care Team took literally weeks and would never respond without me emailing again. I do have plans to pursue this further, but safe to say, there is a reason why ""schools"" like Code Institute didn't exist 10 years ago. As a comparison: A year's Code Academy Pro membership is at most $720US (There are many offers as well with CA that get you 50% discount and so on too - I paid $160US! ) compared to the ‚Ç¨1000s these guys are trying to swindle! There is a far wider array of courses available as well as different career paths. The materials are far more rounded and give the proper historical, contextual and scientific background to the things that you're learning rather than simply being like ""do this and google the rest later!"". Instructions are also far clearer and you are properly tested on knowledge before you can move on to the next stage of a course or lesson. This is not the case with Code Institute as their Input Validation code is glitchy as hell and not user friendly in the slightest. There are a number of other providers like Datacamp, Udemy etc who all have more and better materials at a cheaper price! Long story short: Go with Code Academy for more and better learning materials and service for a fraction of the price! Code Institute is just out to swindle money when there are far better and cheaper options available! UPDATE: 5th December 2023.

"Code Institute was the step into technology as a career for me, I had a very supportive mentor and some great colleagues through the journey. The course material is very in demand for a wide range of developing roles and the support I had after graduating was great. Given the time I spent on the course to the results i got out of it ~ I would recommend it to anyone else who maybe doesn't have the time to do a three conventional academic course. I found a job after seven weeks in a new country where I have never had any experience in before.

"If you are not 1000% sure you want to do this course, do not attempt doing it. It‚Äôs the worse course I came across when it comes to service, and when it comes to overall help with accounts. Why is that? You can do this course for only one day and you will still have to pay over ‚Ç¨6000. I had a problem personal problem, car accident which affected last 3 years of my life. When attaching over 20 documents in regarding to my health, the accounts team said to me that it‚Äôs not a serious accident to withdraw from the course after doing it for a month. I am at a stage when I‚Äôm being charged money randomly out of my account without my knowledge, nothing is helping. While emailing them, I‚Äôm being ignored. There‚Äôs no possible way of calling them because you‚Äôre only going to get to student care which doesn‚Äôt help at all. Place that robs people and nothing else. No wonder why there‚Äôs 98% of people finishing it if they have to pay such an amount no matter what, no matter what medical circumstances they have. I wonder if I would still have to pay if if I would be buried under ground.

Attending Code Institute was one of the best decisions I've made. The 12 weeks I spent at Code Institute learning full stack development was one of the most exciting and rewarding experiences of my life. Not only do you learn a stack that is always being improved by highly experienced industry professionals but you develop the ability to learn and approach other languages and technologies that will benefit your new skill set long after you finish the course. The careers week at the end is also extremely valuable as it helps prepare you by hearing from industry experts and from recruiters working in that field. The best bit of advice I can give is to go to one of the open evenings and ask questions like I did. It truly is a fantastic experience and valuable self investment.,10.06.2019,Code institute,google

"I took the Full Stack Software developer programm; and i'm very satisfied overall. I took the Data Analysis specialization. The topics introduced to me in the classes were clear to understand and very useful in practice. I did it in less than 6 months, which will be the only issue i can reference to. The course is very heavy to be taken in that short time, if you have the availability to take a longer period of classes, go for it, you'll have more time to actually put in practice the exercises; otherwise the schedule is very tight. I have to remark specially, for those who decide to take the short period time; ATTEND THE WEEKLY MEETINGS; it's vital to grasp the experiences from students that are in advance levels and the guidance of the hosts.",04.10.2023,Code institute,google

"Potentially life changing course, with well taught content coupled with really interesting projects and terrific student support. I have zero regrets enrolling. I should add a note of caution though, simply enrolling isn't enough to guarantee future success. The course requires a serious amount of time and commitment without a guaranteed job at the end. But if you're able to fully commit and engage with all that the course has to offer, it can set you up relatively quickly with the necessary skills and mindset to make a successful career in software development a reality - as it did with me.

"The course provides a good foundation in software development in general and full-stack development in particular. It aided in filling in gaps in my knowledge and inspired me to go above and beyond to gain new skills. I'm happy that I now have a good portfolio of milestone and Hackathon projects that I can present to potential employers. The slack community is strong, and I find that a key metric for student's success. However, this course requires professional study techniques and good habits to succeed in assimilating and applying the knowledge and skills in a timely manner. The Hackathons are a great way to learn, get stuck in and challenged, while also giving team members the confidence to continue as they realise that ""they can do it"". It's also a great way to make new friends. Student support is good, and it's good to get ""nudged"" regularly to ensure timely studies and work. I highly recommend this software development course, in part due to the contents, in part due to the support and collaboration structure, in part due to the milestone projects (challenging and the best way to learn), and in part due to the continuous improvement of course structure and content.

"Code Institute ruined me financially and I can't afford to pay for anything in these horrible times, because I paid the ‚Ç¨6k to this amateur level course that can be done for free with the likes of CodeAcademy. I paid ‚Ç¨6k to create projects I could've done myself before the course, to get no diploma at the end of it or a good portfolio. ‚Ç¨6k for no good reason. I asked for a refund, to no avail. A company doing ‚Ç¨10+ million in revenue a year don't have the decency to refund an innocent teenager who they courted to do the course by selling a dream of 'future employment within 6 months' and by using their other marketing angles on their ads and sales calls. Please keep in mind that the majority of the good feedback on this page is for the free 5-day course, not the full diploma course. Code Institute made a wise decision by flooding this page with favourable reviews for free content, drowning out those of us who committed substantial money but were profoundly disappointed by a lack of content, service, and interaction.
They really don't care about you, and will hunt you like crazy for money - even after my payment terms ended they charged me ""by accident"". This is a band of snake oil salespeople rather than a institute or school. Avoid at all costs.",12.03.2021,Code institute,google

"The short answer is the course is a full stack program, but it's absolutely not worth the money. I completed approx 70% of the learning material and submitted 3 projects before deciding that the Code Institute boot camp was a waste of time. Online boot camps have a lot of cheaper alternatives to contend with and that can present a problem for boot camps, who must have something special to bring them beyond someone seeking cheaper alternatives. Right from the get go, the Code Institute has issues, it's HTML course is weak, doesn't cover some basic aspects of website design and has a challenge system that is too restrictively coded at times, so that correct code submissions come back with errors. Hints are generally not helpful, and time can be wasted trying to find errors in your code where it turns out they were looking for an rgba input even thought the instructions were to put in an rgb. Often here the issue is less with the coding but more with understanding what they want you do. It doesn't help that the course is often reams of text with a challenge on another page, meaning if you want to check something, you need to either dance between webpages or have multiple tabs open, which can throw off their progress system. Sure these are minor issues, but also they're generally unique to Code Institute. My overall experience of going through the HTML section was it was beyond lackluster, I opted to supplement my learning with another course. I found this second non Code Institute course to be vastly superior in all metrics, more complete content, better presentation, more coding challenges, better coding challenges, clearer instruction. These issues just pile up the more you go through the course. One of the more egregious issues runs with parts of the course that are out of date. More often than not there's just a quick note attached to the top of a video to ignore a chunk of it and do something else, or the video starts with setting up a legacy coding environment Code Institute no longer uses. Some of these videos are pushing 2 years, so this patchwork of fixes becomes the norm. Again generally looking at other coding courses I've conducted, and no other course is so out of date. The coding projects aren't particularly inspiring either, rather than provide any real instruction, it's a more free from 'do something'. Issues with really stem from a lack of clear understanding of what is required for submission. Code Institute don't present examples of pass/merit/distinction of projects and the mark scheme is vague and uninformative. It didn't help that my mentor wasn't available for 2 of the 3 projects I submitted, and was only available for the last night of the other one. The overall feeling I got was to not be adventurous or push yourself, just do a simple and safe project, which I feel is a terrible way of assessing potential. Feedback from the project submissions is similarly vague and often questionable, but ultimately unhelpful. As someone who has teaching and mentoring experience as a postdoc, the feedback is just lazy. This should be a real strength of a bootcamp but with the Code Institute, it's just another missed opportunity turned into a weakness. I really wanted to use the Code Institute as the core for my learning experience and entry into coding, I was drawn into the rather nicely setup and laid out 5 day coding challenge, which is a good experience. However I came away from every module with a deep dissatisfaction in the learning outcomes. More and more I found myself going to other courses to learn material that should be covered in sufficient depth in the Code Institute subject matter.",10.03.2022,Code institute,google

"I have only done a few intro coding courses with free online resources before this course. This software development online course started off well with the HTML, CSS modules but then JavaScript and Python modules were intensely complicated, covering a lot of concepts and the majority of the time I was left to research and google on my own to understand what was being taught. Tutor support is available but i would have to wait on average 45 - 120 mins for each question and that is not a guarantee they could help as some of them are also recent graduates of the course. I've had many times the tutor's shift ended and they abruptly tell me that and I would have to wait for another tutor to help, they often made me feel stupid and had an arrogant and obnoxious attitude, although there were a few good humble tutors too. Mentor support is for when you do the milestone projects you get 30 - 60 mins each time and you are given technical advice and how to proceed with the project. I didn't really resonate with my mentor but was discouraged to change as I had already started with him. He was telling me that coding was basically fixing coding problems, so you would spend most of your time googling and researching on the internet finding the answers and even when you've been working as a developer for so many years you still don't know that much. Project assessments are a bit random as the feedback tells you to test or code another way that was not taught on the course, which is really strange and puts you up to fail. And they sternly advise you not to share your feedback with anyone else which is again strange. My overall experience is that they just want your money and the support is sorely lacking for something so complicated. This course is adequate if you already know a lot or have developer friends to help you out and you have lots and lots of time and energy to research. Also if you don't mind getting frustrated frequently because you don't know what you're doing and you have to figure it out yourself. You don't really learn to create your own code or syntax, you just copy and paste code from the video tutorials, the understanding of the syntax is not addressed. Don't be swayed by the course being university accredited I had asked them who are the external assessors are and they still haven't been able to answer that.

"Code Institute is the most amazing Coding boot-camp School! If you are seeking tough challenges and even more difficult Milestone Projects this is the place for you! The general layout of the program is mainly video tutorials with mini-challenges and some non-graded quizzes, the main meat-and-potatoes of this course is in the MileStone Projects, there are 4 of them and they are tough so be prepared to dedicate all of your time to finishing this course. It is not an easy program, I cannot stress that too much...you must put in the time and effort to be successful. The Student Care Team and Tutors are there to help and they are a great asset. The Mentoring is great as well and they are encouraging as well and help to fix up your code in real time via shared screens and webcams and its fun and educating to see how they do things! They use Slack Social Networking to communicate with fellow students and others to help each other 24/7/365.

"I‚Äôve just graduated from the Full Stack Diploma in Software Development (with 78%, in August 2019) and started my job (as a full stack web developer) almost two weeks ago. And the first piece of code I‚Äôd ever written was two years ago. I‚Äôve never been a ‚Äòcomputer person.‚Äô I was good at maths at school (logical/good at problem solving), but never thought I‚Äôd ever be into programming. About two years ago I thought I‚Äôd give it a go, and really enjoyed it! When I realised I wanted a career in web development, I thought I should probably do a proper course in it (arguably not necessary, but an awful lot easier).After coming across this diploma, an initial phone call where I confirmed my interest and then going through the sign up process, I started. I was gently eased into the course, both in terms of the course content and pace but also in terms of having a mentor assigned to me to help me out with my coursework - Jim was a crucial part of each piece of coursework. As the course got more tricky, I realised the importance and necessity of self-motivation and perseverance - those qualities are a big part of what got me through the course. Do bear that in mind. The tutor service was also a big part of getting me through the challenges of web development - they‚Äôre quick to respond (within their working hours of course), yet without spoon-feeding you the answer. Overall, I would definitely recommend this course. It‚Äôs no easy course - the qualification, a Diploma in Software Development, as I understand it is equivalent to completing the first two years of university.

"Bootcamps can be an intensive experience, whether you are based in the classroom or studying at distance online. Virtually none of them offer any form of qualification at the end of the course, but this is one of the ways in which the Code Institute differs. Accredited by the University of Edinburgh, alumnis will receive a Diploma in Software Development, which will no doubt aid their chances in landing a job in their new careers once the studies are complete. The big bonus of studying with the Code Institute online (as most will) is the mentor-led training. Having an industry professional to hand whenever you find yourself in a tight spot is absolutely invaluable, as having the chance to speak to someone personally will always override simply searching for answers on Google.

"I have had the misfortune of being a ""student"" of this deplorable bootcamp. I am also going through the bootcamp through Springboard which makes is absolutley free for me. Paying ‚Ç¨8,000 for this course is the equivalent of throwing your money into the fire. 1. The course is outdated. Several videos are 2-3 years old with a comment box above the videos saying how to ""remedy"" the issue. Which in my case mostly never works as the ""remedy"" is often outdated aswell 2. The way the ""instructors"" teach is horrific, they fly through the videos telling you what to do but not actually offering anything of informative value. They are all just code along videos which doesnt help anyone. It just makes you walkthrough dependant. 3. From what I have learned while trying to become a software developer is that you must google everytthing which is perfectly fine. But if you spend ‚Ç¨8,000 on a course they damn well better try and help you to the best of their ability and have as much content on their page as possible, which they don't. I have spent 90% of my time on other sites I.E Coding with Mosh, YouTube, W3schools and Udemy learning as the CI's attmept to teach is pathetic. 4. Up until project 4, the course is a solid 3/5, This is only because you can teach basic HTML, CSS, JS, and Python to anyone that wants to learn. When it gets to project 4 and you actually have to start coding and start learning about the full stack development the course just becomes a joke. I could write all day but im just drained from this ""Bootcamp"". Biggest waste of time. Thank God I didnt pay for it. Ps.

"When my kids had both started school I realised it was time for me to do something with myself. I wondered about going back to my old job in IT support, but I hadn't really enjoyed it and I'd been away from it for so long I would have had to retrain. So after some mucking about with free courses online and a couple of Python books I took on Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development. I was able to study at home while my kids were at school, and completed the course in just over a year. I had wanted to be a developer but I hadn't been sure which language to go for - I was finding I'd start learning something, then find I'd need to learn something else in order to understand it, then I'd need to learn something else and so on. I was tying myself up in knots. This course covers a wide range of web development technologies in a well structured manner, from HTML, CSS and Javascript all the way to Python and databases, with a few libraries and frameworks for good measure. You don't get spoon fed information - what I experienced was that in each module I was given enough information to understand the basic concepts, and taught the tools used to go and find the answers for myself. At the end of each module I was given a project brief and, with the knowledge and tools the course had given, I was able to build my own web application from scratch, based on the brief. This was then assessed and the marks given back to me along with feedback on where I did well or could have done better. I found this was always really beneficial in helping me know what areas to focus on for the next project. I was assigned a mentor who was always happy to help, I was also part of a vast student community on Slack, who are all doing the same course and could offer help and advice where needed. Now I have learnt so much that I am the one doing the helping on Slack! After completing the course I was able to get a job as a Web Developer within a few weeks, and my confidence is still building. I wouldn't be here without the CI course. Yes, it is expensive, however a free course could never offer the same support community, structured learning or assessment feedback that I think benefitted me so much.

"As former graduated from the Full-stack software development programme, I can not recommend this course enough if you are serious about learning code. You can expect to get a good understanding of the world of programming in a relatively short span of time and expect to be ready to start/change career. Obviously, you will be far from being an expert in the field but, if you put the work, you should feel comfortable to step it up at a professional level. Don't expect to be a walk in the park, you must put the work. But if I done it without previous coding experience, anyone can also do it. It will be challenging and demanding at times but it will be worth it in the end. I promise. I decided to take the full time route, Monday to Sunday (+50 hours week) as I wanted to fully focus on it, but it can be done at a slower pace too. Perhaps that would be a far better approach if you don't want to rush trough things. Just make sure if you do it part time that you are going to have enough time to study every week, otherwise you might not be able to cope. Overall, the whole experience has been very positive. Lessons are clear enough, tutors, mentors and support are great. The curriculum it's also good and the online model worked great for me as it provided me with the flexibility of doing my own thing from anywhere. Just make sure you are good at organising your own work. Expect to learn coding at a starting level, enough to potentially land a job or build your own projects. Also expect to learn how to learn faster and to be resourceful on finding your own solutions to problems. These skills are gold for anything in life, not only at a professional level.

"If you are thinking of changing or pursuing a career in IT and are wondering which course to choose then I can recommend Code Institute's Full stack Developer course. The teachers are of the highest standard and have experience in real world coding. The Course material is excellent and is continually being updated to stay abreast with the latest changes.

Your tutor support is very limited, the content is very basic and overall I was left very underwhelmed. The course is a waste of money - but please don't doubt my commitment or dedication. I since have used online resources and hired a private tutor to help me and have progressed leaps and bounds. Avoid at all costs.",06.03.2022,Code institute,google

I completed the full-time course in full stack coding this year after deciding to change careers. Over 12 weeks you go from a novice to being able to create a full stack web app. The bootcamp is help in a classroom on St Stephen's Green which is very handy for transport links. Doing an intensive course like this requires a lot of work. There is prework before starting and I need to do an extra 10 hours a week or so outside class to reinforce the learning. Having previously worked as an engineer in the tech industry the team based environment of the classroom helped me learn and it also mimics how coding is done in businesses. The lecturers are developers so the emphasis is on creating apps rather than theory. The curriculum has been accredited by Napier University so there are clear learning outcomes for each of the 3 months. There is leeway however to submit projects that you want to build. This means you will come out of the course with a portfolio on Github/Heroku to show prospective employers. There is a hiring week where recruiters help to pitch your CV and employers come in looking for coders. If you don't mind a bit of hard work this is an excellent way to get proficiency on the current full stack technologies.,06.04.2017,Code institute,google

My choice to change career came from attending a seminar on coding and i have not looked back since then. Coding has opened up a new world i never imagined i could find myself in as it brought out the values i never knew i possessed. People told me coding is difficult and why don't i look elsewhere but i stayed firm and have not regretted any minute i have spent being a coder. Anyone can be a coder as long as you have the interest and desire to up the stakes on your professional life. Best decision and awesome course this full stack development ,12.05.2018,Code institute,google

It's so awesome for a noob like me :) I'm now designing a wee memory game for my second project & the noobie feeling has gone somewhat :) Don't get me wrong, there is a hell of a lot to learn still but I understand the basic concepts now & so can you .... if you have the dedication :) Code Institute ... awesome for learning & awesome for supporting you :) Invest in yourself, sign up & follow your dreams ..... you'll not regret it ! *** There are only 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who don't ***",05.10.2024,Code institute,google

"This course brought on my coding skills extremely far. I am now able to make a fully functional website that uses api's and lots of other technologies. These technologies range from frontend ones like bootstrap, dc/d3 to backend one like heroku, pymongo, etc. You not only learn valuable coding skills but also how to make it look clean, test it and make it usable for other coders. You also get taught how to push each version of your code to a GitHub repository which I found extremely useful. The support was great and there was never that long a wait for a response to my questions. I did the online course and I would say if you're doing the online one it requires you to have concentration snd self motivation and if you do feel stuck ever when doing the course, make sure you ask for help! One other thing that is nice, is that you are in a big forum with hundreds of other students that are all in the same boat as you. You can see the problems they're having and help them out or vice versa. It was overall a strong community.

"It's a tough and challenging endeavor to up-skill in such a short time frame. However with all the support channels in place you have all the tools you need to be able to adapt and overcome the challenges you face entering into this course. In 3 weeks I was able to go from zero programming skills to being able to independently build a website from scratch using the technical knowledge gained from the course and the culture of independent problem solving it promotes. You do have to weigh it up for yourself whether the sacrifice it takes in time and money is worth it. You basically have to put your life on pause and deep dive into the content for 3 months but if you have the motivation to pull it off you will be amazed at what you can do after just a short period of time. I am 33 years old, I have attempted but never completed an educational degree higher than highschool level and have only done vocational certificates since then in relation to the Hospitality industry. I never paid enough attention to my studies in highschool which resulted in a long and expensive road into tertiary education as I would have had to do a bunch of foundation classes to get back into competing range for a bachelor course making a 3 year turnaround into 5-6years. Now I am discussing tech trends with professionals and can see a different future as the course progresses.

"I'm a student now but my experiences with this course are so bad that I feel an urge to warn people before investing their money in this course. I have completed only stream 1 covering Front End Development. Do you want to know how to make a nice responsive mobile navigation with a button to hide it? Do you want to know how to make a tooltip? Tabs? Popovers? Photo-slider with testimonials on it? The answer for 4500 euros? Add class to Bootstrap. Do you want to know how to make it yourself? How these things actually work? Too bad. I asked the director about it and he told me ""I don't want students to worry about the design, that is why we chose Bootstrap"". You know what their sell page says? LEARN HOW TO USE CSS3,..., TO DESIGN AND BUILD BEAUTIFUL RESPONSIVE WEB APPLICATIONS FOR ANY TYPE OF DESKTOP OR MOBILE DEVICE. You won't be taught to design anything, just add a class to Bootstrap. Is it an information worth 4500 euros? Don't you want to know how to design page elements yourself? No? Than this course is for you. I expected this course to have something extra considering the amount of money I paid. Project for the stream 1 This is what the assignment says: Use bootstrap or flexbox... I want to know how to design these page elements so I choose flex-box. I don't want to take any shortcuts in case I'm asked about these in a real job. There was nothing besides flexbox tutorial in the course content, that would help me to create these page elements. I expected jQuery lessons to teach me how to create these, but nothing besides exercises on how to change background-color was available. Thanks to my book ""Javascript and jQuery by John Ducket"", I've managed to create tabs and accordion. Also this book is ""practical examples"" based which helps to remember stuff. This course just teaches you the language. But so does Codecademy and bunch of other free courses. Is wrong from me to expect a little more for 4500 euros? Please use AngularJS as your framework. After I finished designing the layout of the page I started integrating Angular in my project. What happened to my tabs made with jQuery? My tutor told me that jQuery and Angular aren't a good match and is not recommended to use both in one project. Yet I was asked to include everything I've learned in the stream 1. I got a correct code but it does not work (I spend hours on it). I've send them an open letter mentioning a lack of concept even before I encountered this problem. This just proves it. They just glued lessons on different topics together without worrying about the big picture. Tutors Online tutors don't have a proper chat equipment. My last session was done over mobile phone microphone. I got myself one of the best available web cameras to get most out of the course. How come that people paid for it didn't? I've had three tutors already. The first one was from India. He was more than qualified to be my tutor, very impressive resume. But the reception was so bad I had to ask for replacement - his accent didn't help. I got an Irish tutor who just started doing web development. He helped me to set up the stream 1 project but other than that he struck my as inexperienced and even he had heads up, he wasn't prepared for our session. That was a point when I sent Code Institute an open letter mentioning all the problems I had with this course and I respectfully asked them to either give me my money back or hire me to help them improve the course. So I could actually do something about it not just whine about it. Won't give me my money back Neither happened. Brian O'Grady - Code Institute director told me that it's over 30 days, so they won't give me my money back. Because I completed stream 1 I tried to be fair and asked them for 2/3 of the money I paid. Instead he forced himself on me by saying he wants to help me. I'm basically extorted to stay. Look elsewhere. A lot of content that is covered in Stream 1 is available for free in the Viking Code School. The good? HTML, CSS, D3 lessons and Angular were decent.",19.06.2016,Code institute,google

"When I started the Fullstack Web & App Development bootcamp, I already knew some HTML and CSS basics, and I had always been curious to dive deeper into coding. As a UX designer, I had previous experience creating apps and websites, but for a while now, I‚Äôve wanted to get more hands-on with the actual development side of things.
Let me start by saying: I‚Äôm incredibly proud of my final project. I honestly never imagined that I‚Äôd be able to build something like this in just a few weeks.
The Fullstack Web & App Development Bootcamp is well structured, and everyone at WBS is friendly and supportive. Most of our instructors were relatively new, so they knew the curriculum very well, though they sometimes had to look things up when questions went beyond the course content. Still, they were always available and eager to help ‚Äî I never felt like I was on my own.
The pace is fast, and new topics come at you quickly, but with some self-organization, it's absolutely manageable. You'll learn a lot ‚Äî and you might even get addicted to picking up something new every day! Most exercises are fun and rewarding. Sometimes the official documentation can be tough to navigate, so you‚Äôll need to rely on other resources like Stack Overflow. But honestly, that‚Äôs exactly what real development work looks like. By the end of the bootcamp, you‚Äôll know how and where to find answers ‚Äî and in my opinion, that‚Äôs one of the most important skills a developer can have.
You‚Äôll also work on several group projects, which is great preparation for real-world teamwork. I had a fantastic time during the bootcamp and am now excited to keep learning and (hopefully) find a job in this field.
One final note: don‚Äôt expect too much from the career days. They‚Äôre quite basic, and if you‚Äôve applied to jobs before, you probably won‚Äôt learn anything new there.",16.06.2025,WBS coding school,google
"The ""AI for Business"" bootcamp was a real hit for me. Top-notch in terms of subject matter and also incredibly inspiring for everyday life. The content was well-thought-out and very well-presented. Many practical exercises gave me new ways of thinking and, above all, regularly helped me step out of my comfort zone, giving me a huge boost for my personal development. I found the instructor particularly powerful; he was calm, motivating, and always supportive, without forcing anything on me. I was able to take away a great many tools and methods for my personal productivity. Added to that was a really pleasant, active community. Overall, it was a really good experience for me, one that has had an impact beyond the topic of AI. ",07.06.2025,WBS coding school,google

"At first I was unsure whether my previous knowledge would be sufficient for the data science bootcamp - but this worry was quickly put to rest. The community managers, the entire team and, fortunately, my course partners supported me from the start. I felt very well looked after, valued and looked after throughout the entire course. The course absolutely delivers what it promises - I couldn't have chosen a better bootcamp. The content is didactically excellently prepared (and I say that as someone who taught at a German university myself). The structure is designed in such a way that participants with different levels of prior knowledge are met where they are. Even without previous experience in data science, you can follow the course very well - provided you have a certain technical understanding and a good grasp of data. The teaching is a successful mix of well-founded theory and practical, project-related tasks that prepare students directly for work in companies. Anyone who feels overwhelmed will receive additional explanations and will be supported in a very small and empathetic manner when faced with technical challenges. If you feel underchallenged, you can always try bonus tasks. I found the WBS instructors to be excellently organized and very professionally competent in over 95% of cases. Questions are answered individually, understandably and with a lot of patience - even in larger groups. Another plus is the career advice, which makes it clear that this is a serious further training offer. Of course, no one can guarantee a job - the job market is currently very competitive - but the tips and tools you receive in the course are practical and valuable. I would particularly like to highlight two lecturers who impressed me with their didactic clarity and patience: Markus Hoffmann and especially Vasil Georgiev - thank you very much for your great work! Conclusion: I can recommend the WBS Coding School without reservation. In a very short time I learned everything and more that I had hoped for before the course as the optimal outcome.

"Disappointed by Misleading Advertising and Lack of Real Instruction I enrolled in the full-stack web development bootcamp at WBS Coding School with high expectations, based on the promotional materials that promised 396 hours of live, instructor-led instruction, personalized support, and the ability to tailor the learning experience. Unfortunately, my experience has been far from what was advertised. Here are the key issues I encountered: Live Instruction Time Severely Lacking: Although the schedule suggests several hours of live teaching per week, in reality, each session often includes only 30‚Äì50 minutes of instructor-led explanation, with the remaining time dedicated to self-study. This is not what was promised under ‚Äúlive, instructor-led sessions.‚Äù
Self-Learning as the Default, Not the Supplement: While independent learning is important in any tech field, it was effectively the primary method here. Complex topics were introduced with minimal explanation, and students were left to navigate dense, confusing materials on their own. Disorganized and Inaccessible Learning Platform: The online platform was difficult to follow, poorly structured, and not inclusive for different learning styles. Despite raising this concern multiple times, no improvements or support were offered. No Real Customization or Personal Support: Promotional claims of personalized guidance were not reflected in my experience. Reaching out to instructors and staff with concerns yielded vague encouragements rather than real support or adaptation to my learning needs. No Accountability When Issues Were Raised: I submitted a formal complaint outlining all of the above. The school denied any wrongdoing and closed the complaint without offering a solution, despite extensive evidence.
I‚Äôm sharing this review not out of frustration, but to help others make an informed decision. If you‚Äôre looking for a bootcamp with consistent live instruction, hands-on guidance, and clear learning pathways, I strongly recommend you explore other options.",04.04.2025,WBS coding school,google

"I enrolled in this course to shift my career in a new direction, and my agent at the German ""Agentur f√ºr Arbeit"" recommended WBS Coding School. After thorough research, I decided to go for it, and it turned out to be the best decision I could have made. The courses were conducted remotely, with a two-week on-campus phase at the end where we worked on a final project together. My instructor was extremely competent, kind, and supportive, demonstrating a deep understanding of the material and excellent teaching skills. Despite having limited prior knowledge, all of us bootcamp attendees learned so much that we now feel confident applying for jobs in data science. The on-campus phase concluded this journey perfectly, and I was quite sad when it ended. The campus is beautifully located right by the River Spree in Berlin, and jamming on the piano almost every night was a delightful bonus.

"WBS CODING SCHOOL // Data Science Bootcamp I participated in the 4-month-long Data Science Bootcamp. Overall, it was a great learning experience that solidified my Python knowledge, taught me SQL basics and a variety of data new data analysis techniques. - many teachers don't have tech industry background - no tight networking opportunities within the tech industry -Previous Knowledge- I have a PhD in marine science and had quite a bit of previous experience in statistical programming with R as well as a little bit of Python experience. Therefore, the first couple of weeks were rather slow for me. However, after roughly 4-5 weeks, the pace started picking up and I felt thoroughly challenged. -Curriculum- The curriculum is project-based and hands-on, which is the right way of learning for me. You start a new project every 1-3 weeks. There are live lectures and coding lessons. We covered basic data analysis and visualization with Python and SQL, Cloud computing and data pipelines, web scraping and API calls, A/B Testing, Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning (Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, etc.) and Recommender Systems. The only thing that was missing in the curriculum, in my opinion, was Deep Learning. The last 2.5 weeks are spent on a final project, either alone or in groups of 2-3 people. -Daily Learning- On a regular day, you would have some read-through material on the Online Learning Platform, followed by one or two lecture/coding sessions. The rest of the day is used for project work. By the end of the project, you usually present your work to the class. Students organize themselves during their projects. They can work together in Discord channels, or separately. They can use Github for collaborating or whichever other tool to facilitate exchange. How much you enjoy the learning journey depends a lot on your class mates and the group dynamic. -Campus Phase- Students can come to the WBS Campus to work on their final project (~1h South-East of Berlin Mitte). This has been the most fun part for me - I would recommend anyone to go if you have the chance. The bill is ~600,-‚Ç¨ for 11 nights of accommodation and 3 veggie meals per day. You can either pay it yourself or have it covered by the job center. -WBS Support- I've experienced the WBS CODING SCHOOL employees to be very helpful when it comes to organizing stuff. The job center had first declined my application for the campus phase. Together with the WBS staff, however, we were able to convince them to fund me. -Teachers' Expertise- The instructors I've had lessons with during the bootcamp were all knowledgable in the course material. They were also good at teaching and approachable, with some very few exceptions.
However, they are certainly not all experts from the data science industry. The WBS website mislead me on this one, as many (perhaps most) instructors do in fact not have industry experience. That doesn't make them bad teachers, but it still put me off, as I'd expected industry expertise. -Career Opportunities- There is a Career Service that offers online learning material, three mandatory daily workshops throughout the bootcamp, a CV, CL and LinkedIn screening and a one-time career advice session. The workshops helped me a lot to brush up my profile. The only thing I'm missing is - again - a tighter connection to the industry. There are guest talks by people working in tech, but that's pretty much it. I would appreciate it if the final projects were presented not only to WBS peers, but also company representatives. This would encourage networking and job finding for graduates. Many thanks to the WBS CODING SCHOOL. Keep up the good work!",15.02.2024,WBS coding school,google

"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the full stack web developer course. The course costs 10,000 euros, the content that the WBS Coding School offers is not nearly worth this price. It's more of a ""guided self-study"" in which you get your assignments in the morning and then independently upload them to external sites, such as. Codecademy (premium access costs around 25 euros per month). The ‚Äúlessons‚Äù sometimes build on each other more, sometimes less. However, they are difficult to understand for a beginner due to their poor structure. The school‚Äôs own learning platform is not good. It contains errors, both in terms of content and language. The user interface (correct answers in the quiz are highlighted in red, for example) is confusing and poorly structured, just as the content is poorly structured. You're bombarded with an absurd amount of information in a short period of time, so you don't even have the opportunity to learn the important principles of programming. This is put into perspective with the sentence ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt teach you everything.‚Äù Certainly okay for those with code experience, but completely unsuitable for absolute beginners. When you criticize, nothing usually happens afterward, except for a few hackneyed phrases like ""you can do it!"" or it is claimed that someone is coming towards you and then nothing happens. I'm terribly disappointed and feel a little ripped off. The course didn't help me professionally. It just took time, nerves and money to be exactly where I was before. And, oh yeah. ‚Äú85% find a job within 3 months‚Äù makes sense if you have already completed your studies.

On campus: This is the highlight among all of it. All the people is nice, the stuff, the students, instructors and more. It is a priceless experience to go on campus so if you consider to take it, please go!, it is worth it. Good accommodations for you to stay, nice food with even chefs and with a beautiful view of a river in Berlin. You can not ask for more. Price: The price is fair for all that you got, even when you stay on campus it is cheaper that staying in a hotel in Berlin Work search help: They prepare you with your LinkedIn, how to do an interview, how to behave in job interviews, how to post to job and more. This part was the most scare I was of the Bootcamp but if you use every tool you definitely will get a job So overall there is not negative stuff to say, this is a good school for you to get into and I hope this helps.",15.09.2023,WBS coding school,google

"After a long research I finally decided join CodeWorks, as in joining at all, then which bootcamp and was very pleased. Two weeks after graduating I received an offer from a well-known company. As for my background I started learning to code in 2018 in my free time. Despite my prior experience it still was a very challenging, eye-opening and rewarding experience and I learned a lot. Being self-taught I faced major issues hurting my success landing a: - lack of clarity what you need to know, - working in a team (big one) - foundational software engineering skills (think beyond web-dev plus escaping tutorial-hell) - career support I was able to get over all of them, it gave me a lot of clarity, passion and confidence on what's important to work in this industry. The technical knowledge (which is top notch) is only part of the puzzle here. You'll not only learn but embody foundational software engineering skills. It's designed to be challenging, so don't expect to just 'download the knowledge' into your head. It's hard and that's a good thing. You'll receive top-notch support from instructors, career-support team and your peers, that help you grow in the long run. ",01.11.2021,Codeworks,google

It is a lot of money but if you are in Germany you can go with the Bildungsgutschein and then it is totally worth it. I would advise to learn to code on your own before joining because of the fast pace. I've seen colleagues struggling with frameworks because they didn't deeply understand the basics. Not because the basics are not explained, but because it is too fast to absorb everything. Nevertheless, it delivers what it promises: 5 weeks after graduation I got a job as a full stack developer. Two of my colleagues also got a job in that time frame. All of us had some previous experience in the industry. The support they give you after graduation to find the job is really good. They help you to tweek your CV to get more interviews and the do a weekly follow up to check what is working and what is not.

"I was a student at Codeworks between January and April 2021 at the Berlin Campus. I took the full 12-week Software Engineering course. I would highly recommend Codeworks to anybody who is interested in becoming a Developer. I signed up for the course as I was looking to start a career as a Developer and was impressed by the reviews I saw online. I can honestly say that it really did live up to what I was hoping for. 6 weeks after the course finished, I had multiple job offers from different companies in Berlin for Developer roles. I am now working as a Full Stack Developer with a great company and a great salary. The course is very fast paced and you definitely need to get yourself a bit of experience with coding and a general idea of what being a Developer entails. It is 12 hours a day for 6 days a week so you have to accept that you will not have any sort of social life for 3 months. You also very much get out of it what you put in, so you need to really concentrate and push yourself to learn new things very quickly. Some pros and cons of Codeworks... Pros: - The campus in Berlin is really nice with great facilities - The team in Berlin and the wider company are super friendly and helpful - The content and tech stack is very relevant in regards to what company and employers are using - Once you finish, you receive lifetime career support and guidance which is really helpful Cons: - It is expensive - The lectures are not given face-to-face, they are pre-recorded videos with Q&A sessions afterwards I would say that the pros definitely outweigh the cons, and if you are serious about becoming a Developer then it is a really great option.

There is space for a special meetup and they could exchange in a different environment.

"The kind of joy DCI had brought to my life - at times I just wonder why I was not able to find DCI ealier. DCI had brought hope again into my career life. I studied Computer Science in my younger age in my own native country. But when I relocated to a country of a different language, I found myself subjected to the kind of job that kept me very sad each day because of language barrier. Also, I lost my ground in Computer field because of new innovations and concepts over the past years. However, the day I got connected to DCI was the day my job career turned around for good. DCI took me up as a fresh beginner and brought me up to the latest and modern tools in the Computer job market. Since then, my joy had no limit.

Special thanks to our incredible class management team, Julia Anders, whose ever-helpful nature made navigating challenges easier, and Alexandra van Dijk, for her guidance in the fellowship program.

"My Experience with DCI Was Horrible Contract Violations and Lack of Confidentiality DCI required students to sign a contract prohibiting discriminating, offensive, or inappropriate language. However, when violations occurred, the response was appalling. For example, when a student reported harassment, the teacher exposed the victim in front of the class, disregarding confidentiality. The reporting student received no protection and was instead targeted by a bully, who faced no consequences. Over time, those adhering to the contract were bullied, silenced, and humiliated, often during class. And I'm not talking about some little inappropriate joke. This is no case of cancel culture or being overly sensitive. Despite mandatory training on soft skills and diversity, DCI failed to embody these values, effectively supporting a toxic environment. Most companies would never accept this kind of behavior. Favoritism and Nepotism The teacher openly favored two students out of 15, and unsurprisingly, they were the only ones offered internships through DCI‚Äôs partner companies. The rest of us were abandoned, with no meaningful support from DCI‚Äôs job coach or management. It was clear that helping students succeed wasn‚Äôt a priority. Retaliation for Speaking Up Raising concerns with management only made things worse. Speaking out against harassment or other issues led to retaliation, creating a culture where silence was the safest option. The teacher ignored inappropriate behavior during classes and project presentations, further fostering a toxic environment. I've heard hateful comments and the teachers mostly just ignored it, saying we are adults. But then why won't the DCI enforce these rules? Students were expected to pretend that the diversity training was meaningful, even as DCI‚Äôs actions contradicted its own teachings. A Demoralized Class After six months, the teacher complained that no one but their favorite two students wanted to present exercises. Given the toxic environment, it was no surprise that students felt demoralized. Participating felt pointless when DCI showed no genuine interest in student well-being. Other students could simply belittle your presentation in front of the class and the teacher would move on as if nothing happened. The only reason it didn't escalate, was because the belittled students didn't respond to these comments. Fake Reviews on Google DCI‚Äôs Google rating plummeted to 3.6 stars but miraculously rebounded overnight with 50 suspicious reviews. Upon investigation, I recognized many names as DCI employees. It was clear they were burying legitimate negative reviews with fake positive ones. Some were reported and removed, but not enough to reflect the true experiences of students. Do not trust the high ratings‚Äîthey may be fabricated by employees. My Personal Experience I joined DCI with strong qualifications and extensive IT industry experience, hoping to upskill. I was the only student in my class to secure a job immediately after the course‚Äîand I did it entirely without DCI‚Äôs help. The job coach was dismissive and unprofessional, blaming students for their struggles. She even refused to answer my direct messages, when I asked how to proceed since I found a job. It felt as if she was weirdly unhappy that I found an IT position without her. Final Verdict: Avoid DCI While some teachers are competent, DCI‚Äôs overall environment is toxic and unprofessional. The institution fails to support students, creating a demoralizing experience that undermines its credibility. Employers don‚Äôt trust DCI certifications for good reason‚Äîthe organization fails to practice what it preaches. If DCI cannot uphold professionalism, how can it prepare students for the real world? Think carefully before enrolling. Unfortunately I fell for the fake reviews and didn't listen to the bad reviews.",15.01.2024,Digital career institute,google

"My learning experience at DCI had its ups and downs... Started with a blocked laptop, then they sent me another one, and then I was having problems also with that one regarding the updates and asked if the IT support could have a look at that, no support regarding that, they asked me if I wanted to switch laptop again and I said no, not taking another chance. I bought my own because my personal old laptop was already having problems. It didn't only happen with the laptops, but also with the teachers, they switched twice the teacher. The last teacher switch wasn't really necessary (with 6 weeks left to the end of the theory part) and it was super overwhelming for me. When you're used to a teacher, and the class already created like a family environment, you just can't switch it and disregard the learning experience of the students. It's just selfish. Also, the arguments are already complicated and then, you force your students to make a double efforts to finish the course.

"Please trust the bad reviews. After the 12-month Web Dev course, this is my opinion:
- teachers with no ability to teach.
- confusing lessons, given by someone who knew nothing about what they were teaching.
- the curriculum isn't bad and could work if there was the slightest organization, preparation of materials and lessons.
- lack of support from class support (your complaints will either be ignored or answered too late).
- too many hours wasted on job coaches and soft skills classes that don't help at all, with their typical quotes of toxic positivity. Just wait until you get to the wonderful job search support program...
- my class went through moments of despair (we all had to buy extra online courses because otherwise we wouldn't learn anything), until we literally had to shout in meetings in order to be heard and change something (which did change, but it was too late after 9 months of complaining).
- After that, some teachers were good at teaching and were good people, nice and understanding and I'm really sorry they had to go through this mess of a school, but unfortunately even they can't make me give them more than one star.

"I've done 2 courses at DCI over the years (Web Development and AWS re/start) and though I am thankful for the experience and information I have received from DCI. I believe DCI's approach to teaching could be drastically improved. I will start by saying that i believe DCI gave me a good foundational understanding of the subjects that i was then able to build on in my own time, but , in my Web Development course, i was expecting to get more than just a foundational education from DCI as the course was 12months. I think DCI could be improved by having: - a better student to teacher ratio (there are too many students per teacher) - providing teacher training sessions to their staff so they can format the information in a more digestible manor for the majority of students - hosting task review sessions straight after tasks are due to be submitted. I understand that learning via zoom comes with its challenges and benefits, but these challenges should not stop/excuse DCI from finding a way to produce high-quality results. I think these suggestions would have made learning with DCI a more enjoyable experience and improved our fundemental knowledge on the subjects. I also think that each student needs to be looked at by DCI as an individual student and not as ""just part of a class"", unfortunately, it is easier to detach and become less invested in a person when you are not physically close to them. but again, This is also a challenge to working and studying remotely, and a challenge that I am not sure DCI is committed to overcoming.",14.04.2022,Digital career institute,google

"Orientation course at DCI (4 weeks) I took part in the orientation course for digital careers and gained a lot of insights in 4 weeks. Webdev and online marketing were treated primarily and were TOP in this combination for me. However, some of my fellow students were a bit disappointed about the different weighting. The only point deducted is that I wanted a better division of the class between beginners (no digital knowledge) and advanced students (media designer or related professions). My consultation with Bogdan was fantastic and courteous. Even after being rejected by the office, he still tried to get me started. Unfortunately, it didn't work out for one of the annual courses because funding wasn't approved. Thanks for the great time to all the lecturers, especially Julia (OM), Wilhelmine and Max (Webdev) ",15.04.2025,Digital career institute,google

"At DCI I completed my second training in Salesforce Administration. I was looking for a course with an education voucher from the federal agency or job center and came across their online campaigns. The registration process to get an education voucher from the Federal Agency worked without any problems. The course ran from June 2024 to February 2025 as online training. After studying chemical engineering and an MBA many years ago, the Salesforce administrator training was a new challenge for me in the IT sector, in which I had no previous experience. So I was very tense at the beginning. The schedule of the course was good with a semester break of two weeks in the summer. The content of the course was adaptable for the famous Salesforce Administration exam. Two Salesforce projects enabled students to focus on key topics and experience lively business ideas. There were twenty-one members on the course from various disciplines. Despite high student participation, our course instructor, #RyanPlumridge, delivered stable and high performance. Despite his young age, Ryan was an experienced CRM expert. He had established good communication and appropriate authority over the students. He was very helpful to each student despite the different personal abilities. In my opinion #RyanPlumridge was a fundamental part of the course. I definitely feel grateful for his great work over the fourteen months. I also had the opportunity on Monday morning to focus on my language skills and improve my communication skills. On Monday afternoon we had the opportunity to get to know different perspectives of Salesforce with our mentor. From Tuesday to Friday the course continued with full classes and classwork from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. All courses that are funded with educational vouchers address the topic of career advice. What DCI does is inform students about career opportunities and improve their application processes. Unfortunately, there is no job placement for interns or jobs. It's probably the same for all courses. Although there were occasional problems with teachers and mentors, DCI was able to solve them quickly. This was particularly important for such a course to remain agile and react quickly. Many thanks to Klassen Management, #SelinaSch√∂n, for her passionate commitment in these critical moments. On the other hand, the Alumni Talks, video conferences with experts from the IT industry, were eye-opening events for students to experience new perspectives. My special thanks to #RyanPlumridge for his excellent teaching throughout the course. I would also like to thank my mentors at DCI #HosseinNiko and #SiyandaNgage for their continued support. Finally, I would like to say that I can recommend the Digital Career Institute for further training in the IT sector.",15.02.2024,Digital career institute,google

"I think all the 5 star reviews are fake. They don't reflect my experience at all. Or they come from people who took the basic course (which I thought was great too). The annual course was completely useless and only served to make a profit. I didn't have a well-trained teacher, his German was very poor and he therefore didn't have the linguistic skills to explain things properly or use different words so that everyone could understand. I saw teachers being reprimanded but I didn't fully understand the reasons behind it and a teacher in my class was suddenly fired. Students in my class then supported him because the termination was probably not carried out legally by the DCI. It's all really strange. I have my certificate but I can't really do much with it. The DCI is even said to have a bad reputation with companies. I regret having taken the annual course and wouldn't recommend the DCI to anyone I care about. Never! Go to another provider!

"I completed a 14-month training course to become an online marketing manager at DCI, which took place completely remotely - and I have to say, it really worked brilliantly! Even though many people are skeptical about remote learning, I was pleasantly surprised at how smoothly everything went. A big compliment goes to the lecturers, who have imparted an incredible amount of knowledge to us with their commitment and competence. I particularly liked that we were able to delve into many different areas of online marketing. As a result, we have not only built up a sound basic knowledge, but also developed a better understanding of the big picture. You learn how important it is to work with other teams in marketing - and it helps enormously to know what your colleagues are dealing with. For me personally, this further training made a real difference: I returned to my original industry, but in a completely different position. This new knowledge has given me a unique selling point that I can now take full advantage of. I am incredibly glad that I decided to take this further training.

"I did the Java boot camp and learned a lot: Java, Spring Boot, React, TypeScript and MongoDB, but also CI/CD with Docker and GitHub Actions. I found test-driven development (i.e. unit and integration tests) and OAuth to be most important. After the boot camp you will feel fit enough for your first job in the industry. The team was super nice and the coaches really had an answer to every question. The first two months are about learning - every week there is a project on the material. In the last month you do a final project where you can choose topics together with the others. If you can afford it: highly recommended! If not, there is of course something from Udemy or other online platforms.",14.05.2025,neuefische,google

"I attended a Java Development Bootcamp this year. Unfortunately, my experience with it wasn‚Äôt very positive. When I had questions, they were only answered superficially. Regarding the referral voucher, the person who referred me couldn‚Äôt receive their reward, even though we tried contacting them 4 times after my Bootcamp graduation, but they completely ignored us. There was no direct assistance to improve job opportunities during or after the Bootcamp. In my opinion, the three months and the cost of over 10K euros were far too expensive. Especially considering that other schools allow students to keep the notebook after the training, whereas here, that wasn‚Äôt permitted. There are much better training programs available on the market now. I regret not taking the opportunity to enroll in another school I had considered, which offered courses in both Java and Python along with an Oracle certification upon graduation that would have better supported my job search.

I was also able to complete the ‚Äúhomework‚Äù successfully and without errors. Here in the reviews I also read it once or twice that NeueFische only wants to improve their placement quota. This impression also arose from the above-mentioned experience.

"I had an excellent experience with Neuefische's Data Bootcamp in 2022. The career transition the bootcamp enabled me changed my life for the better. Since then, many of my old coaches have resigned, presumably because their own staffing situation and work atmosphere have deteriorated significantly since acquiring another training provider. Three friends I recommended to the Neuefische bootcamp report the same experience: coaches who have no clue and only read from presentation slides, course participants who are thinking aloud about dropping out of the course because no one is addressing their concerns, and business clients who are dropping out and no longer see any need to hire half-baked bootcamp graduates into entry-level positions when their quality standards are barely distinguishable from all the self-learning career changers who acquire their specialist knowledge from tons of free offerings. In addition, all career coaching (revising CVs together, application training, job search advice, etc.) has been almost completely scrapped. I waited three months for the recruiting bonus for my first two recruits, and I think I was only fobbed off because I was really getting on the staff's nerves. I've been waiting for my third and definitely last recruiting bonus for a month now. No communication from new recruits. The admissions team is ghosting me. I'm just writing to them every day out of spite because I don't begrudge them keeping the recruiting bonus. I don't even need the recruiting bonus. I'll probably give it to the colleague I recruited as compensation. I find your current business practices simply awful and feel sorry for every poor, lost career changer hoping for a fresh start with you. You had something great and let it go to waste.

"I successfully completed the six-month web development boot camp in December 2023. This part-time offer gave me the opportunity to continue working in my job (self-employed) and to look after my son. Nevertheless, the boot camp was a huge challenge for me, as a real career changer and at 59 years old. I have absolutely nothing to complain about the content of the web development boot camp, the form of delivery and the coaches. That was all very good. However, two things were difficult for me personally. On the one hand, half of the course participants were overqualified and already very experienced in using JavaScript and other tools. This performance gap can quickly lead to an inferiority complex and stress. Daily practice sessions with two other participants at my level helped me keep my frustration at bay. I can highly recommend it. On the other hand, time. The six months are packed with learning material, i.e. longer absences are not compatible with the boot camp format. If your children or parents become ill during this time and you have to take care of them, you have a serious problem. Such situations should definitely be considered or planned in advance. My conclusion: I can recommend a ‚Äúnew fish‚Äù boot camp. But - especially for real career changers - it is absolutely not a sure-fire success and requires perseverance.

There were a lot of doubts about even starting a boot camp: what is the quality, can you really be able to do something after 3 months and apply with it? So now I can say: absolutely! After three months, I built a cool and functional app, tried out a lot of technologies, and sent out a lot of applications. We had 2xCareer Sessions where we talked about CV, application process and salary. In addition, you can always book one-to-one sessions if you want to talk in detail about your CV, job position, doubts, etc. That helped me a lot. In general you could talk to every coach about one thing or another. We were all supported by you all the time. We were always asked for feedback and were always able to say what could be optimized and where in the process from our perspective. And yes, even though I've studied before, I found the boot camp tiring. My group were all motivated and hardworking. Otherwise we wouldn't have made it without that. It takes a certain amount of discipline to continue at the same pace, especially after the bot camp. After 1 month of intensive applications, I got my first job as a software developer! So it's absolutely possible to get the job, you really have to want it and do something about it.

First I was asked about my plans and I was allowed to tell everything in a relaxed and timeless manner about why I decided to make a career change. It has to be said that not everyone is cut out for an IT job (programming specifically). They tried to find out whether I was actually very interested in it! Since I had already started self-study months before to test my stamina, this was a great prerequisite for starting my studies. I was informed that I would be asked some questions in English, as some courses were only available in English and you wanted to make sure that you could follow them. (Logical right?). I was asked why I think teamwork is important and had to briefly explain myself in English. (I don't speak perfect English at all, but I understand a lot and can communicate) IT simply requires knowledge of English. Afterwards I was sent a programming task that I had a weekend to complete. (HTML/CSS/JS). This simply examines how to deal with it and find solutions. Which I think is good!

They were always available to answer questions and took the time to listen to all participants if they had any problems. The two of them taught us the tools of web development step by step.

"I completed the first ever AWS re/Start Cloud Developer Bootcamp remotely in April 2022. Before the bootcamp I was very skeptical: so many positive reviews, is this real? You're supposed to learn so much in such a short time? That would really be the starting salary after 3 months??? Yes, yes and yes again. Whether or how you succeed in the boot camp depends, of course, on your own commitment and motivation (e.g. avoid long evenings and weekends). The team spirit that you develop when you get involved is priceless. Apart from that, we had such a gifted coach who was able to impart his knowledge with calm and patience in such a way that you could always draw energy. It was an honor for me to be able to take this course! It was exactly what I was looking for for my lateral entry and the much more effective alternative to teaching yourself everything via tutorials (which are great preparations or add-ons). Even more important: Contrary to my fears, it wasn't a bulimic learning boot camp, but really sustainable through constant application (e.g. we had weekly coding challenges in which we reviewed what we had learned and worked on a task all day long). The boot camp is not to be taken lightly, you feel pretty much all the emotions there are, but definitely no boredom. Through LinkedIn, some have even received contract offers halfway through the boot camp! Overall, the organization and course design, including input from invited coaches, is simply recommended. And now to all the skeptics (like me at the beginning): relax. If you really want to do the boot camp and are interested in the topic, then contact the student service for further information. Many questions can be answered. The entire team at Neuefische is totally relaxed and helpful. The recording process is half as crazy if you do a little preparation.

"Since I have also read ""difficult"" reviews here with unrealistic expectations of a bootcamp, I would like to describe my impression as a graduate of the web development bootcamp for those who are undecided: The boot camp at NeueFische is good! More than that, it's fun. The topics are wonderfully chosen, the coaches are keen and very approachable (patient, nice, talkative - etc., all of which makes learning socially pleasant), the classes are a very good size with 10-15 people and two coaches each, the career coaching is a beneficial support, especially towards the end (you can get the reverse recruiting experience) and overall there is good cooperation, an open ear for wishes and a good feedback culture. But there are no magicians on staff either: programming is not fun for everyone and therefore not for everyone. There should be a certain affinity, interest or wealth or desire to invest more energy. The boot camp can provide a fertile environment in which programmers grow many times faster than on their own, and the company contacts can ensure that coding bears fruit more quickly. In my opinion, this happens through the insight into the ""overall programming picture"", the coaching and ""ability to ask questions"", the internal group dynamics of the participants and the constant engagement with the topic. If you think it's enough to just run for 6-7 hours, three months isn't enough.q My tip for those who are undecided about WebDev courses: Visit FreeCodeCamp.org, do the full Responsive Web Design lessons and a bit of Javascript first. It works quite well and is fun? Well, call or write to all interesting boot camps: ask about the group size, coach-student ratio, ask about the topic content or the techniques/frameworks and compare. You might even want to look at the partner companies and talk to them about it. NeueFische was suitable for me, even remotely, and I am grateful for that. I was neither the best nor the worst, I didn't find it hard, but I did find it difficult and I actively tried to get a lot out of the three months. Last tip: Training like this is most successful when it is more intensive than a 9-5 job - so it's better to do it in winter rather than summer. This means you can repeat something after the course without risking death from FOMO.",01.09.2021,neuefische,google

"I participated in the data-science bootcamp at the end of 2021. The camp was a wonderful opportunity to learn the basics of the field within the shortest amount of time. Positive sides of the bootcamp: ‚Ä¢ How the group of students is carefully chosen. ‚Ä¢ Competent and helpful coaches ‚Ä¢ Clear structure: morning theory lectures, afternoon applications with coding ‚Ä¢ Variations between cooperative- and self-learning phases ‚Ä¢ Four long weeks for the graduation project. For most of us, that was the first time we worked so closely for so long with other colleagues on a project. ‚Ä¢ The professional connections made during the camp, with experienced data scientists and ex-bootcamp students. On the negative side, the notes/pdf-slides for the lectures need to be reviewed and improved. Also, after the bootcamp, you are still going to need to improve your skills in both sql and cloud technologies, as these are some of the most sought-after skills in the data-science job advertisements.

"Data Science - 3 months bootcamp - Hamburg (completely remote) I completed the bootcamp a couple of weeks ago and I found it super helpful and a good starting point to change your professional path into the direction of everything to do with data science. Will you know everything about data science after only 3 month? No, of course not, but you get a solid foundation and be able to build on that within your next role. And I'm still impressed what I learned and achieved in this relatively short amount of time. If you are worried about if it is too much or you need to know a lot about statistics, as I was a bit: yes, it is a lot, and it definitely helps if you have a background in natural science or similar, like a field that uses statistical methods. Also it helps if you used UNIX before. And yes, the bootcamp is intense, but it can be done. You get a lot of support from the coaches, you just have to ask. They are super friendly and take the time to find solutions and are also willing to change the approach even during the bootcamp if you just let them know. For us, sometimes we felt a bit overwhelmed, but the learning by doing approach that is practiced during the course is good. Also, you have all of your fellow bootcamp students to talk to and (at least in my team) everyone was helpful and we had a great atmosphere. It helped that people came from different backgrounds in my opinion, and I was sad that during the pandemic we only met remote. The bootcamp also helped me to get the position that I wanted. Luckily, I was able to do the course via the unemployment agency, otherwise it would have been too expensive for me.

Career opportunities: Neue Fisch has its own career service, which you should ABSOLUTELY contact as early as possible. The people there are always willing to listen, are happy to find out about companies that are partnered with Neue Fisch and will put you in touch straight away, which saves you from having to apply in the traditional way.

The team has also managed to create a family and personal component in which the well-being of all students is a priority, even away from the screen. I will always have fond memories of these 3 months!",01.04.2021,neuefische,google
"Really nice Web Development Bootcamp. Jerry and Lene are amazing coaches, who helped a lot even for a non german speaker like me. The course allowed us to learn different languages of coding and helped us create small projects. The course was intensive (3 months) but I found myself in a very good group of people who had the interest to learn and help each other. I definitely recommend this Bootcamp for anyone who wants to enter in the world of coding",16.05.2021,neuefische,google

"I finished the Web Development Bootcamp in Hamburg last week. And here I write a very positive recommendation. As some others have written, we learned a lot in a short period of time. It's hard, but the coaches, the organization and the culture of NEUE FISCHE have made it easier. The content was well structured and conveyed really well. Jerry (head coach) and Lene (assistant coach) did an excellent job and also paid attention to how we felt during the boot camp. They were able to lift us up and motivate us, even when the topics were complex and our energy levels were not that high. What I liked most was that we didn't just learn to program in isolation. But we learned to work as a team, as we hopefully will soon do in our new jobs. This interaction based on agile principles was very valuable for me. For me the most complicated part was with myself. I had very little prior knowledge, so I had to invest a little more. But still, I never had the feeling that I was falling by the wayside. And if anyone doubts this bootcamp, take me as an example, no prior knowledge and I still did it and am very proud of it. All in all a great experience and I can only recommend it with a smile on my face. ",01.06.2021,neuefische,google
"After careful consideration, I decided against traditional training and opted for the Web Development Bootcamp and it was definitely the best thing I could do. As many have already written before me, the most appropriate adjective for these three months is probably ‚Äúintensive‚Äù. It's incredible how much and how quickly you learn. The amount of knowledge you can absorb and implement in such a short time is really fascinating and it's all the better to be able to say afterwards: ""I did it!"" The lessons build on each other well and even if there are frustrating days, you are always picked up - by your classmates, by the coaches, by your own motivation. You share so much time together that after three months it's almost a bit strange and sad not to see the same faces all day. :) Of course, behind the successful concept there are also the appropriate coaches, without whom this great feeling would not happen - in Hamburg we had Jerry and Lene at the start for web development and this dream team sailed us through the time brilliantly - with specialist and insider knowledge, Sensitivity, motivation and, above all, constant interest in how we are doing, whether we have kept up and if it doesn't work out quite so quickly, a lot of effort to teach those who sometimes take a little longer new Implement what you have learned. Of course, a boot camp like this (which really deserves the name!) cannot be compared with a classic training course - but it is a solid basic building block. But you also have to really enjoy it and be prepared to have virtually no free time for three months. This secures a first step into your job life in the front end, but you don't have to go the rest of the way alone, even if there is of course a lot more independent learning to do now. But you also receive support and advice for job interviews and contacts with potential employers, which means that not only the ‚Äúschool time‚Äù itself is so valuable, but also everything surrounding it. Of course, the team is also worth mentioning - if all classmates are so interested in this type of further training, the concept works best, because last but not least, you also learn to work in a group and support each other. People grow together really well here and I really appreciated that the whole time! Finally, a few words about remote learning, because I wasn't in the mood for it before the boot camp - but after a short time I realized how well it works and how suitable it actually is. It worked perfectly for both learning and group work, as well as the communication surrounding it (a small study group in the evenings and on the weekends or conversations with Student Services) and I can't imagine learning any other way.",01.12.2020,neuefische,google

Overall, a very well thought-out concept that was implemented effectively and lively by friendly and committed coaches. In my opinion, the switch to digital distance learning during the various lockdowns worked very well. Overall, it was a tiring but wonderful time that was absolutely worth it.

"TLDR A very good boot camp. If you want to pursue a new career path, this is the right place for you. CURRICULUM The curriculum covered everything that is currently relevant in web development. No outdated libraries or frameworks. No dying programming languages. Everything was carefully selected and conveyed with sound expertise. COACHES Such a format depends on the coaches. It is a very intense and demanding time. Therefore, it is not just the specialist knowledge that is important. Enthusiasm, commitment and empathy also play an important role in ensuring that participants complete this camp successfully and take a lot with them into their professional lives. And here I can only say high praise to our assistant coach Lene Frei and our head coach Jerry Erbs. I felt like I was in very good hands from the first second. Definitely a flagship of the boot camp. ORGANIZATION The organization was first class. Despite the current pandemic, Neuefische has developed a remote concept that is effective, fun and places a great focus on humanity. CONCLUSION As already described, I am more than satisfied with the bootcamp and can recommend it to anyone who is convinced and motivated enough to pursue their future career path in IT.

"April 1st, 2021 was the last day of my boot camp in Hamburg (remote). Initially skeptical as to whether remote learning would work well, I can no longer imagine anything else. Our coaches Jerry and Lene were great! and were able to convey and explain the learning content well. I would have liked something like that when I was at school. However, without the initiative to actually practice what you have learned, it becomes really difficult - after all, you really learn a LOT here in a SHORT amount of time. I can only recommend the course to anyone interested in web development. ",03.04.2021,neuefische,google
"I completed the Web Developer Bootcamp in Hamburg with Jerry (Head Coach) and Lene (Assistant Coach). From the first meeting to the last day, I can only give positive feedback! The boot camp was held 100% remotely, which worked extremely well and matched the learning material. As expected, it was an intensive time that often demanded a lot from me and at the same time was a lot of fun. It's amazing how much you can learn in such a short time. Jerry and Lene got us through this challenging time with a lot of commitment, sensitivity and sensitivity and were great coaches and contacts. From the basics to current topics and best practices, you will be provided with extensive knowledge that I would never have been able to acquire so accurately in the jungle tutorial. The way it was delivered was also great thanks to the coaches‚Äô high level of teaching expertise! I think the boot camp is exceptionally good - carefully designed, the content is practical and up-to-date, and at the same time it has a very high interpersonal quality. Anyone who is interested in the topic of web development and is thinking about further training... in my opinion, absolutely recommended! ",01.04.2021,neuefische,google
"I did the Web Development Bootcamp in Cologne (almost) completely remotely and can absolutely recommend it. At the beginning I was skeptical as to whether remote would work so well... but it's no problem at all and probably even better than live lessons, as you can set up at home (e.g. second screen) and share the screen directly if you have questions so that everyone can hear and learn from error messages and problems. Digital tools such as Zoom and Slack are used ideally. The ‚ÄúZoom concept‚Äù with the many breakout rooms, which you can use not only for group work but also after class or on the weekend for ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù meetings, is mega :-) The learning content is perfectly coordinated. You are not overwhelmed with ppt slides, but rather learn from the beginning in practical projects and use the countless resources available on the Internet. This has the advantage that you can immediately understand how to distinguish the good from the bad online resources and how to understand and try out new software, for example based on the official documentation. Nothing different will be done in practice. The content builds on each other very well and at the end of the boot camp you suddenly notice ‚Äúhow everything makes sense‚Äù. It is always important that you become a ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù web developer, meaning that you understand the context and don‚Äôt just use frameworks/libraries. The coaches in Cologne (Leon and Philipp) are awesome. You know this from school or university - the subjects with the best teachers were the most fun and you learned the most. The two of them are extremely helpful, committed and personable, have an incredible wealth of experience and can teach it to even absolute beginners. It was not uncommon for the whole group to be completely exhausted and frustrated because they were overwhelmed and had the feeling that they no longer understood anything. The coaches always managed to move forward in small steps and infected us with their joy and motivation. Definitely one of the best teachers I've ever had :-) In the last month you have been working on a digital journeyman's piece in which you go through a complete project from the idea, planning, design to the development itself. This means that you then cumulatively apply all the content that you have previously learned and learn/consolidate an incredible amount in the process. A great thing and also practical for showing the new skills in action when applying for jobs. A big focus is also placed on the new fish community. Even after completing the course, you stay in touch via Slack etc. and can, for example, share interesting resources, exchange ideas about jobs, do code reviews for each other's own small projects or ask any other questions. Overall, an absolute recommendation if you are interested! The three months at Neuefische were a great time and I'm very happy I decided to do it :-)",31.03.2021,neuefische,google

The gathered knowledge was revisited in hands-on pair-programming sessions. The learning curve was very steep and I am amazed about the number of topics that were covered in the past three months.

I actually think it has a huge amount of advantages instead of disadvantages. Screen sharing made it possible to solve coding problems clearly in a group in a very short time. The social aspect wasn't neglected either, as we worked in groups every day and were able to learn with and from each other - usually there was even a group drink at the end of the week.

The great team spirit of the whole group motivates you to stay on the ball again and again and master the three months together.

I would give a point deduction for support when starting your career in the new industry. The two responsible employees seemed to me to be very focused on the Hamburg location and, apart from the two group coaching sessions on application topics included in the course program, there was little communication and support. However, I am not deducting any stars because the head coach made up for this gap and gave very valuable tips on technical interviews. Although I came from a completely different industry (social work/education), I managed to switch industries and can recommend the boot camp concept. However, you should be aware and willing to spend 3 months very committed and intensively learning complex content and getting involved in dealing with your own mistakes positively and letting others help you and helping others yourself.

The best part of the course was definitely the hands-on projects and assignments. They were tough but super rewarding. They didn't just teach us coding skills; they taught us how to work in teams and think on our feet. The resources they gave us were okay, but sometimes they left a lot to be desired. The material could be confusing and too simplified, so I often found myself doing extra research to really understand it. The sense of community at Spiced was amazing. We had regular social events like Friday beers and karaoke, which helped us bond as a group.

"I recently completed the intensive Fullstack Web Developer Bootcamp that left me not only well-versed in the intricacies of the language, but also eager to return each day, thanks to the fantastic community fostered within the program. From day one, it was evident that the instructors were deeply passionate about teaching their knowledge. The curriculum was well-structured, covering everything from basic syntax to advanced topics like asynchronous programming and frameworks. The hands-on approach, coupled with real-world projects, ensured that theoretical knowledge seamlessly translated into practical skills. What truly set this bootcamp apart, however, was the incredible camaraderie among the participants. The people I met were not just teachers and classmates; they became an essential part of my learning journey. The collaborative and supportive environment created by both instructors and fellow learners made the challenging moments fully enjoyable. ",11.05.2024,Spiced academy,google
"Good teachers, good atmosphere, nice location, in general it feels like being a real student on a real campus, teachers really do what they can, they are very caring and supprotive trying to explain / answer students' questions. The only one thing that really surprises not in a nice way: the content of the course does not match exactly what their admissions managers sell on the phone (significant parts of the promissed program are missed, i believe it is not done on purpose, they just do not know certain things), and the way how management handeled this topic when the goup asked them a few direct questions about that. In general I believe it is a good way to study if Arbeits Agentur pays for you, it is a good start, once the bootcamp is done continue working, take courses on Udemy or any other online platfroms you know, take part in competitions and search for a job in parallel, do not stop. All the best to all students and teachers as well! ",11.04.2024,Spiced academy,google
"My experience at Spiced has been pretty good. Although I've had to push through a lot of stress and frustration, that's pretty much what it to be expected from a bootcamp like this. My cohort of the Data Analytics class was luckily very small with 6 people, which meant that we had a lot of individual attention from each of the teachers. Some topics were more difficult than others, but we always had someone on-site to help us with questions. They were also very thankful for any sort of feedback we gave them and adapted to our needs. The teaching pace is pretty quick, but once again I got lucky by being in a small cohort. Some of the people in the larger cohorts were understandably not too pleased with their experience, so hopefully there will be a cap on max class size soon. My course was financed through the Agentur f√ºr Arbeit, which took away a lot of stress in terms of payments. Spiced made this process easy to navigate and as stress free as one can hope for. By far the best part of this experience were the people though. The teachers, staff members, and especially the other students made this a fun experience. Although I wasn't always happy, it was great receiving the support of other people and bonding over lunch, Friday beers, or even karaoke. Overall I can recommend taking a course here, especially if you get lucky with your cohort size. It will be difficult and intense, but in the end it will be worth it.",11.01.2023,Spiced academy,google

"I'm super happy I attended the bootcamp (Full Stack Web Development) at Spiced! All of the staff is super helpful and has such a positive energy. I started with basic knowledge of HTML and CSS and learned a lot about web development and feel definitely job-ready. Things which can be improved: Since it is a very personal experience and it very much depends on everyone's self, I still think that the bootcamp can be a bit more intense. Sometimes there was a bit too much free time between the classes. This time could have been used to dive into details or to teach additional technologies. I definitely disagree with reviewers who say that teachers are disorganised. No one can help, if you don't ask further questions or say that you're left behind. ",11.02.2023,Spiced academy,google
"I am aware that the learning process is something individual and with many variables involving teachers, classroom environment and emotional intelligence. In my case, the Data Science course was great. Dedicated teachers, engaged colleagues and a teaching based on mutual exchange and curiosity that I can only define as transformative.

"So dissatisfied with the way they concluded my application for the course after waiting 8 months to get on, they dismissed my entrance one week before. The barometers to pass the entrance assessment were very poorly communicated to the point of me failing the assessment when I had been told it was to see how we respond to feedback and the answers did not need to be perfect. When I appealed, they then went on to explain they had taken too many people on for the course?! It is now one month after and they still haven't returned the funding back to the job center. This is having very stressful and complicated repercussions on my life. I could be made homeless if I don't get on a course as soon as possible and the job center cannot offer me another course until they have the funding back. Terrible communication, in terms of the feed back, I felt very 'passed around'. @spiced - Please return the funding to the Job Center as soon as possible - I cannot apply for another course until this happens - I don't understand why this hasn't happened sooner?

"I did the fully remote Data Science bootcamp. The small class size of approx. 15 students as well as the full-time teaching staff made it a very focused and productive experience. Teachers were able to dedicate a lot of time to answering questions in one-on-one breakout rooms and I appreciated the remote learning structure. We would do a lesson all together and then work independently on our weekly project in smaller batches in breakout rooms that changed daily, allowing us to connect with our classmates and ask each other questions. We would complete the week with short presentations from each person about one aspect of their project. Week on week, we developed a portfolio of 10 projects plus our final project, which we worked on individually. The curriculum is Python-focused, spending only about a week on SQL even though it's a key skill in the job search. It covered many topics including machine learning (classification, regression, natural language processing, time series), data processing (NumPy, Pandas), data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Metabase dashboard), deep learning (recommender systems, image recognition), data pipelines (AWS S3, web scraping, APIs, MongoDB) and more. In a 12-week program, these topics are covered quickly so the course's documentation portal was a great online resource for reviewing topics, even after graduating. Career resources were good, covering basics like types of jobs, salary negotiation, CV writing etc. You have to take the initiative to set up one-on-one meetings with an assigned career advisor, which is a useful resource with specific input on your profile. Ultimately, relying on career services is not enough to result in a job. Networking, applying a lot, speaking with in-industry mentors via free external resources also needs to be part of the effort. Overall, an excellent foundation, but like every bootcamp it requires independent study afterwards (especially in SQL) to gain proficiency. Career services offer a good boost to get started, but you have to keep going and networking on your own.",11.06.2023,Spiced academy,google

I had a really great Experience in the Data Science Bootcamp here. I had no prior technical experience and implemented a Data Analytics Platform at a startup by myself after the Bootcamp. I learned how to train Models and wrap an API around them before containerising everything and deploying it to the Amazon Cloud. Also the SQL Foundations have had a great impact on my career so far. I can recommend this course to everyone who is really motivated to understand Machine Learning and Data Driven Technology. I would recommend to make sure that you ask always when you don't understand something ( teachers will help you always) and watch YouTube videos in the evening so that you can keep up. But you are motivated you will do fine. Thanks to the great team especially Marija! ,11.12.2022,Spiced academy,google

"A life-changing experience. From the lessons I learned during the course I started a learning path in this new world of Data Science. A year after finishing the course I still go back to the course material to continue reviewing and understanding more of the information I received, the references and pages recommended by time issues are not able to be seen during the course but it becomes a material that with the passage of time becomes even more valuable. The course was intensive and the teachers were always very well disposed to solve all my doubts, which in my case were not few. They have a very good knowledge of the subjects and above all an excellent relationship with the students. I strongly recommend taking a course like this and I invite you to open your eyes to this new and exciting world of Data Science.",11.10.2022,Spiced academy,google

"Terrible experience. It's more a fast-paced no-frills topic review to check all boxes and say they ""covered them"" than a bootcamp to truly learn something new. Each class is with a random assistant so there isn't good continuation from topic to topic and the head isn't nice at all to students, even gets annoyed when people ask questions. Horrible learning environment. No one pays for the bootcamp, the German government pays so no one really cares if they learned. Only 2 people in my cohort found a relevant job and because they had previous experience. I made a huge mistake choosing this place. I now know their employees leave the positive stars here...

"Attending SPICED Academy was one of the best decisions I have made. Since I was moving from the US to Berlin for this course, I did a substantial amount of research in order to find the right school for me and I ultimately chose SPICED. I applied in March 2018 to start in the October 2018 cohort and during that time I completed the prep course work several times to get a good grasp on the concepts. I joined the bootcamp as a complete beginner and once I finished the course, I was amazed at the incredible progress I made, how much I learned, and the applications I was able to build. The teachers are incredibly helpful and always willing to help you work through a problem but also ensure you understand why that problem occurred in the first place. That being said, this course is also incredibly demanding - it is a bootcamp after all! I spent an average of 10-12 hours every day at school for 6 days of the week. This is a fast-paced learning environment where you are challenged on a daily basis and expected to learn by doing. One of the first things I learned at SPICED was getting comfortable with certain parts of your application not working and how to patiently troubleshoot and work with your peers to figure things out together. This is all part of the learning process! There were times when I was incredibly frustrated and other times when I was overjoyed because I made something work on my own. In all, I absolutely recommend SPICED for anyone interested in making a commitment to learning programming. It was a gratifying experience that provided me with the skills necessary to apply to the workplace as a junior developer. You just have to be willing to put in the work in order to truly see progress in your abilities and get the most out of this course.",16.11.2018,Spiced academy,google
